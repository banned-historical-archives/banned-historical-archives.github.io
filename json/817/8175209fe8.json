Indeed, Chinain the 194os experienced few spontaneous uprisings of workers and peasantscomparedtotheRussianRevolutionof1917.Instead,theCCPexpandeditspower from its base in northern China via a civil war with ChiangKai-Shek'sNationalists (1946-1949)-in other words, through military conquest.

Rural-registered peasants were organized into collectives andcompelled to sell any agricultural surplus above a prescribed level to the state,which had a monopoly on sale and purchase and imposed consistently low prices.A rural hukou carried no entitlement to a state ration card,wages or socialsecurity,which were replaced in the collectives by work points(gongfen) thatcould be exchanged for grain. Almost every peasant was a member of an agri-culturalcooperativefrom1956andofalargerPeople'sCommunebetween1958and the early 198os. Within communes, party branches were established on thelevel of the production brigade, and at the lower levels individual householdsweregrouped togetherin smallproduction teamsfrom1961 onwards.Formuchof theMaoperiod only small amounts of currency circulated in thecountryside.A production team's incomedepended heavily onlabor perfor-mance.The lack of an effective system of redistribution in rural areas meantthatweathercouldhaveaseriousimpactonlocalcollectives,andpeasantsinmore developed areas typically atebetter than those in poorer ones.In provincessuch as Henan, the diet of the rural population would rely on sweet potatoes,widely regarded as “pig food” in the richer south,until the early 198os.In addition,becauseminimumrationswerenotclearlydefined,rural distributionwas subject to far greater manipulation by local actors than was possible in thestate-organized urban supply system.In times of crisis, rations might still bedistributed, but the food was of poor quality and had little nutritional value.14 Xiao Donglian, “Zhongguo eryuan shehui jiegou xingcheng de lishi kaocha,” Dangshiyanjiu,No.1 (2005), Pp. 8-11.15 For detail see: Tiejun Cheng, Mark Selden and Timothy Cheek,“The Construction of SpatialHierarchies:China’sHukouand DanweiSystem,”in Timothy Cheek and Tony Saich(eds.),"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"New Perspectives on State Socialism in China(London:M.E.Sharpe,1997),Pp.23-5o.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The reform process destroyed tradi-tionalruralelites,labeled as“semi-feudallandlords,”once andfor all.Indeedthe CCP continues to use the liberation of peasants from exploitation and miseryto justify thelength and violence of the revolution.Land Reform,coupled withthe new regime's success in bringing inflation under control and nurturingeconomicrecovery,meantthatmanyChinesewelcomedtheneworder.Scholars, both Western and Chinese, have long described the years between 1949and 1956 as a “honeymoon period” between party and people.3 However, theseyears saw one of the deadliest purges in the history of the PRC, the Campaign toSuppress Counterrevolutionaries (1951-1953).

No replacement for the abandoned Republican criminalcodewas adopteduntil1979.During the Mao era, party and state were not clearly divided.

Until 1959 Mao was both Chairman of the CCPandPresidentoftheState,whileLiuShaoqiandZhouEnlai,histwomostseniordeputies within the party, were respectively Chairman of the Standing Committeeof the National People's Congress and Premier of theState Council.For the CCP, the term “democracy” meant forming a broad class allianceunder CCP leadership to remove power from the old elites, thereby effectinga “democratic revolution” that would place the country in the people's hands.Alreadyin the193os,Mao and theCommunistInternational(Comintern)hadargued that foreign imperialism had stunted the growth of Chinese capitalism,leaving China's bourgeoisie too weak to lead the kind of democratic change seeninWestern Europe in the previous century.This left the working class,led by theCCP, as the only force able to liberate the country from the oppressive forces offeudalism, imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism.

In his June 1949 article on\"The People's Democratic Dictatorship,” Mao identified “the people” with thefour allied classes,set against three groups of class enemies-landlords,bureau-cratic capitalists and counterrevolutionaries-who would need to be suppressedfor the revolution to succeed. Mao argued that the suppression of these enemiesshould be accomplished through the state apparatus,with democratic freedomsandcitizens'rightsbeingaffordedonlytotheworkingclassanditsallies.5Intheearlyyears,theparty took a slightlymorenuanced approach,seeking the coop-eration of some capitalists to help operate enterprises and manage urban admin-istration or foreign trade relations. The CCP's distinction between members ofthe sympathetic “national bourgeoisie”on the one hand and the despised\"bureaucratic capitalists” on the other allowed the party to identify a selectionof “good\" capitalists whose skills could be put to use. The lenient treatmentexperienced by the national bourgeoisie led some capitalists to heed the govern-ment's call to stayin orreturn toChina,even as othersfled abroad after thecommunist takeover.° The party's initial reliance on bourgeois elements, how-ever,did not mean that thebourgeoisie as aclass was ever equipped tochallengethe new regime in any serious way.

The CCP had begun distributing land to peasants in the late 192os in itsrevolutionary base areas and had repeated the process on a larger scale in the“oldliberated areas” of the northeast between 1946 and 1948.Official statisticssuggest that the national Land Reform program saw 43 percent of all China'sagricultural land distributed to 6opercent ofits rural population.1² Officials whohad served in the US government after World War Two believed that ruralsupport for the communists in China and Vietnam grew largely out of theseredistributive policies,ascribing the “loss of China”in 1949 in large part to theGMD'sinability tocarrythroughlandreform.Itwas thisbelief that ledAmerican advisers to promote similar reforms during the US occupation ofJapan and South Korea, as well as under the GMD government on Taiwan.DebatesonLandReformToday,views on Land Reform tend to be less clear cut.A number of scholars inChina and theWest now argue that the reforms pursued by the CCP wereunnecessaryineconomicterms,suggestingthatpre-revolutionaryruralChinaIoArlenMeliksetov andAlexanderPantsov,“TheStalinizationof thePeople'sRepublic ofChina，in William C.Kirby(ed.),Realms of Freedom in Modern China (Stanford,CA:StanfordUniversityPress,2003),Pp.200-201.11GailKligman andKatherineVerdery,Peasants underSiege:TheCollectivization ofRomanianAgriculture, 1949-1962 (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011), p.68.12JurgenOsterhammel,Shanghai3o.Mai1925:DiechinesischeRevolution(Munich:Deutscher"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Taschenbuchverlag,1997),p.232.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

These concessions meant that,in many villages, there was littleextralandactuallyavailabletoberedistributed.TwoChinesescholarshaveclaimed that the most important aspect of Land Reform was not the expropriationof land but the reduction of rents.

The only exceptionwas for foreigners or people in the public eye, who were to be executed only withtheapprovaloftheStateCouncil.37Thegovernmentdesignatedseveralgroupsofenemies, singling out “local tyrants,” bandits, backward elements, spies andmembers of sects.In contrast to rural China,where class labels based on eco-nomic categories were key, in urban society the enemy was defined primarily bypoliticallabels.34 See Gong'an zhengce falu yanjiushi (ed.), “Zhonghuarenmin gongheguo chengzhi fangeming"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"tiaoli,”in Gong'anbu fagui huibian(Beijing:Qunzhong chubanshe,198o),Pp.96-99.35 Li Ruojian, Xushi zhijian: 20 shiji 5o niandai Zhongguo dalu yaoyan yanjiu (Beijing: Shehuikexue wenxian chubanshe, 2o11), Pp. 27-33.36 “Zhengwuyuan, zuigaorenminfayuan guanyu zhenya fangeming huodong de zhishi,” in JGYL,Vol.I,P.359."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"37 “Zhonggong zhongyang guanyu zhenya fangeming huodong de zhishi,”\"in JGYL,Vol. 1, p. 422.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

However, theRepublican state lacked the capacity to enforce the law across the full spectrum ofChinese society, and formally sanctioned divorces remained rare before 1949.Moreover, the Republican Civil Code still permitted men to keep concubines,and the marriage law did little to prevent the widespread sale of women.A husband remained able to legally sell his wife to a third party as long as her\"consent\"hadbeen secured.52The new Marriage Law of 195o defined marriage as between one man andone woman, enshrining in law the principles of gender equality and freedom ofmarriage and divorce.

Perhaps unsurprisingly.neither the CCP nor the GMD considered the Qing's westward expansion animperialproject.TheQingwas a multi-ethnic stateruled bytheManchu court.By contrast,theRepublican claim to sovereignty after 1911 was modeled onWestern ideas of themodern nation state, being premised on defined borders, residents as citizens andthe existence of a national“Chinese”identity.Both the revolutionaries of 1911and,in later years,the GMD realized that this nationalidentity would have to gobeyond homogeneousHanculture if theyweretohave anychanceof holdingtheterritories of the Qing Empire together.59 The weakness of successive Republicangovernments illustrated the point clearly.Freed from central control,parts oftheperiphery soon fell away from the Han Chinese heartlands, coming into thehands of warlords (Xinjiang), local theocratic elites (Tibet) and Japanese colonists(Manchuria).OuterMongolia,meanwhile,became anindependentsocialiststatein1924 and pursueda close alliancewith theneighboringUSSR.Even afterthe defeat of Japan in 1945,the GMD government was unable to establisheffectivecontroloverthesefourimportantpartsoftheformerQingEmpire.TheUSSRwas aheavy influence on the CCP's approach to the ethnic mino-rities.In the 192os and early193os,the party modeled its concept of state-building on the Soviet Constitution of 1918 and promoted theidea ofaChinesefederalunionthatwouldincludeautonomousrepublicsinMongoliaTibet and Xinjiang. These semi-independent polities would protect minorityrights toself-determination and regional self-government.However,followingthe Japanese invasion of Inner China in1937 the party leadership began todownplay the federalist approach,which was replaced with an emphasis ona multi-nationality UnitedFront.6oThe party'sscommitmenttoself-determinationmorphedinto an emphasis onlimited autonomyfor thenationalminorities within an unbreakable Greater China. The CCP increasingly pressedanti-imperialist arguments into service in support of its territorial vision.Foreignpowers, notably the British in Tibet and the Japanese in Mongolia andManchuria,had attacked the“unity of the motherland\"and theintegrity ofitsborders, which all patriotic citizens were therefore duty-bound to defend.6159JamesLeibold,ReconfiguringChineseNationalism:HowtheQingFrontieranditsIndigenesbecame Chinese(London:Palgrave,2oo7),p.39.6oZhou Minglang,“The Fate of the Soviet Model of Multinational National State-Building in thePeople'sRepublic of China,”in Thomas Bernstein and Li Hua-yu (eds.),China Learns from theSoviet Union,1949-Present (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2010), p. 48o."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"61 Zhou Enlai,“Guanyu woguo minzu zhengce de jige wenti,” in JGYL, Vol. 10, Pp. 5o7-5o8.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

It was the CCP, after all, that moved the government back toBeijing,theMing andQingcapital.Mao's proclamation of the new statewasmade from the Gate of Heavenly Peace,the entrance to the former royal palacesof the Forbidden City.An image of the gate became part of the national coat ofarms, an imperial symbol repurposed for a new age.

In the late 195os, Tiananmen Squarewould become the most important symbolic space in the new China, a site ofmass rallies and large military parades.The leaders of the CCP did not regardthemselves as new emperors,but they made obvious use of the empire's rhetoricaland figurative legacy.

Especially in times of crisis, this frontier was almost entirely porous,withKazakhnomads and othersmovingfreelybetweenChinese and Sovietterritory.As elsewhere, the party initially proposed a form of control based on a UnitedFront with local elites. Compared to Tibet, however, representatives of theUyghurs enjoyed little influence in government.With no special agreement todelay the CCP's socio-economic revolution, Land Reform was enforced in theearly 195os.As it did in Tibet, the PLA played a central role in the new order, butin Xinjiang its work consisted mainly of supporting large-scale Han Chinese in-migration.In 1952,Mao made patriotic appeals to demobilized soldiers tovolunteer to stay in “backward\"areas to help build the new China.Initiallyover Ioo,ooo soldiers were demobilized as part of a program to reclaim agricul-tural land and build new homes,infrastructure and industries.In 1954 theproject was given formal shape in the guise of the newly established XinjiangProduction and Construction Corps (XPCC). This body, known informally as\"the corps” (bingtuan), also had a role in public security, riot suppression andborder control. The party's use of the XPCC echoed strategies of peripherycontrolwithconsiderablehistoricalpedigree.ThelateQinggovernment inparticular had used hybrid agricultural and military settlements(tuntian）toexpandits controlbeyond theGansucorridorintoXinjiang.TheCCP alsohadits own tradition of producer armies, carried over from the pre-1949 revolu-tionarybaseareas.The size of the corps increased from 175,451 in 1954 to 311,470 in 1957.69The overwhelming majority of this substantial labor force was Han.

The policies of the CCP inXinjiang were obviously in line with the imperial tradition of combined agricul-tural and military settlements.However,they alsobore similarities totheSovietUnion's policies, themselves built in certain ways on the imperial legacy of thetsars.Stalin supported Russian resettlement in the Far East as a strategy topromote industrialdevelopment and establish control.In1949he advisedChineseleaders toraisetheHanpopulationinXinjiangfrom5to3opercentthrough massive, ethnically targeted migration,71 and sure enough by 1964 theregion's Han population had risen to 31 percent.7² In contrast toEuropeancolonial activity in North America and Australia,Han settlers did not drive thenativepopulationfrom theirland,norwereUyghurs andKazakhskilled by theincoming Han.

Thus, the proletariat was the ultimate liberating class, expected not onlyto seize power, but to abolish class structures and exploitation entirely.During the Chinese revolution of 1949, peasants had played a much moreimportant role than the urban population. Urban workers, however, representedthefutureofthecommunistcauseandakeyelementof theindustrialized,socialistcountrytheCCPwasseekingtobuild.Inlinewiththerestofthesocialistbloc in Eastern Europe, the party in the 195os saw workers as the most progres-siveclass.Industriallaborersworkedwithadvancedtechnologiesinthefactoriesof urban China,and their social relations were thought tobebased less onkinshipstructuresthan onclasssolidarity,builtthroughcollectiveexperiencesof strikes and class struggle on the shop floor. The growth in the number ofindustrial workers in stateindustries after 1949 therefore amounted to an expan-sionofthepool offuturesocialists.Afterprivate ownership of land andmeans ofproductionwere abolished,everyonewas tobe aworker.In short, the CCP's descriptions of “mastery of the country” grew out of theworkers'theoreticalroleintheconstructionofsocialismandtheexpectationthat,asthenewChinamodernized,theworkingclasswouldinexorablyexpandwith it. On these terms, “mastery” did not necessarily equate to governingauthority. In fact, the party constitutions of 1945, 1969 and 1973 defined theCCP not as the servant of the working class but as its “vanguard.\"6 The partywas the mouthpiece,not of the transient, subjective desires that workers mightthemselves express,but of their deeper, objective interests.Building a communistfuture required the party to inculcate “class consciousness”into the workers,5Karl Marx andFriedrichEngels,Manifesto of the CommunistParty(1848),www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/cho1.htm#oo7(accessedMarch3,2o17).6 Zhongguo geming bowuguan (ed.),Zhongguo gongchandang dangzhang huibian (Beijing:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Renmin chubanshe,1979),Pp.46,206,212.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

His departure also had a highlysymbolic effect.

Puyi's autobiography, ghost-written by Li Wenda and includ-ing a favorable account of hislabor reform experiences,was translated intoseveral foreign languages.23 Needless to say, ordinary prisoners tended to facea muchlesslenient system than that encounteredby theformer emperor.Official regulations in the 195os declared the goal of thelaogai system to be\"reform first, production second.” Nevertheless,obvious tensions existedbetween Thought Reform - a desire to re-educate prisoners - and profit22Some works aredealing withtheissue:Jean-LucDomenach,Der vergesseneArchipel:GefangnisseundLager inder VolksrepublikChina(Hamburg:HamburgerEdition,1995),translated by Cornelia Langendorf; Klaus Mihlhahn, Criminal Justice in China: A History(Cambridge,MA:Harvard University Press,2oo9).23 For example:Pu Yi, From Emperor to Citizen:The Autobiography of Aisin-Gioro (Beijing:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"ForeignLanguagePress,I964).Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

OneWestern scholar doubts the ability of the laogai system to generate any realsurplus, rightly drawing attention to its relatively small size (o.65 percent ofnational production).27 We can only speculate as to how many prisoners died inthe camps during the Mao era,but it seems unlikely that conditions would haveconvinced many inmates of thegreatness of thenewsocialistsociety.Eyewitnessaccountsdescribeasysteminwhichrationing wasusedasa disciplinary tool. Inside the camps, prisoners were categorized based ona hierarchy of “ordinary” and “political\" crimes.Prison brigades and individualinmates were ranked according to output and were required to supervise eachother andreporttransgressionstothe authorities.Under the1954laogairegulations,inmates could be kept inside even after their sentence had elapsed, meaningattachment toalabor camp could become essentially permanent. Those whowere still considered a threat after serving their sentence became so-called “freeprisoners,”unable toreturn to their original work unitsbut allowed toliveoutside the camp, draw a regular salary and bring their family to live with them.28Beyond the laogai system,the less severe penalty of laojiao or “labor re-education”became increasingly important during the early 195os as the govern-ment crackeddown onurban crime.Amongthosesentforre-educationwereworkers at brothels and opium dens,which were closed along with jazz clubs,dancing and gambling halls and most restaurants as the CCP attempted to stampout“bourgeois anddecadent”nightlife.Marginalizedurbangroupssuchassexworkers,beggars,drug addicts,street peddlers and the homeless were alsosubject to laojiao.All these groups were seen as victims of the old society,buttheir“parasitictendencies”madethemcandidatesforThoughtReform,and24 Quoted by Mihlhahn, Criminal Justice in China,Pp.223-224.25 Mihlhahn,Criminal Justice in China,p.269.26 Cai Yanshu (ed.), Laodong gaizao gongzuo gailun (Guangzhou: Guangdong gaodeng jiaoyu"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"chubanshe,1988),Pp.2,9,14.27Domenach,Der vergesseneArchipel,pp.366-370."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"28Mihlhahn,CriminalJustice in China,p.258.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

By 1951 some parts of the country had already begunthe nextstage ofthe Communist Party'svision:the collectivization of agriculture.Initially,this process was called“cooperatization”(hezuohua) to distinguish thenew organizations from the Soviet Union's collective farms. On paper, there werethree steps to cooperatization.First, several peasant families would organize\"groupsfor mutual aid\"that would worktogether during theharvest seasons,with no change to the private structure of ownership. Second, a larger number offamilies would come together in primary cooperatives that produced asacollective.Intheseearlycooperatives,moreworkwasdoneincommon,butthe amount of land,laborpower,cattle and agricultural toolsthateachhouse-hold had brought into the cooperative affected the distribution of produce afterthe harvest. Finally, in the advanced cooperatives, land, cattle and machinerywerecollectivelyownedandgrainwasredeemedagainstworkpointsearnedonthe basis of labor performance.Families were,however, permitted a plot of land“for private use” to supply their basic needs. Before 1957,the CCP promised thepeasantry that joining the cooperatives was an entirely voluntary affair, and thedecision to enter a cooperative remained theoretically reversible.Nevertheless,bylate1956almostthewholeruralpopulationhadbeenorganizedintofullsocialistcooperatives,atleastinmajorityHanareas.Whydid the party decide to push ahead with collectivization sosoon after thecompletion of theLand Reform?Amajor contributingfactor was theCCP'sbelief, in line with contemporary Marxist-Leninist theory, that the formation oflarger agricultural units would increase productivity.Land, labor and machinepower could be used more efficiently at larger scales.Mao and other partyleaderswere alsoconcerned about how ruralsocietywould developinthe aftermath ofLand Reform.Theleadership detected signs of new class divisions in ruralsociety,and concern grew that groups of“new middle peasants”and “new richpeasants”would emerge and seekto exploit hired labor as their predecessors haddone.

Nor did China face the kind of civil warbetween the state and thepeasantry that had broken out in theUkraine duringthe collectivization process there. One possible reason lies in the party's gradualistapproach, which allowed collectives to be formed step by step and gave peasantstime to adjust to the new way of life. This is at best a partial solution, however,since the party's neat three-step program was by no means universally adhered to.Pressure to collectivize during 1955 and 1956 meant that huge numbers of villagesnever went through the process of forming mutual aid groups and primary coop-eratives. Instead, many communities “made the step to a heaven in a single day,establishingadvanced cooperativesdirectlyoutofmutual aidgroups.Another answer to the “peaceful transformation” problem lies in the recogni-tion that, by 1955, the CCP had already removed most rival centers of ruralpower.In theSoviet Union,kulaks(affluent peasants)and the church still playedanimportantroleinvillagelifeinI928.TheSovietCommunistPartywastherefore forced to destroy the rural elite at the same time as it implementedcollectivization,with millions deported to Siberia during the so-called“dekula-kization” campaign. By contrast, China's rural elites -indeed, virtually all ruralorganizations outside of Communist Party control-had been destroyed by 1951,when Land Reform came to an end. Moreover, the CCP had stronger roots in thecountryside than its Soviet counterpart. In 1955, 17o,ooo party branches existedin22o,ooovillagesacrossChina,boastingacombinedtotalof4millionmembers.32 The Soviet party had a much more limited presence in rural areas,instead relying also on the so-called “25,ooo,” a body of urban workers whoweremobilizedtosupportthecollectivizationprocess.In the early part of the collectivization campaign, the CCP adopted a “classline”approachthat limited entry to the cooperatives to those with goodclassstatus.This restriction caused significant problems,since those excluded tendedto be wealthier villagers, without whose cattle and tools many cooperatives wereleft poorly equipped.

Contradictionsbetween the people and their enemy would inevitably be antagonistic and couldonly be solved by the suppression of counterrevolutionary forces.However,\"contradictions among the people”-that is, disagreements among those loyalto the communist cause - were non-antagonistic in nature and could be resolvedby discussion and persuasion. The CCP, Mao claimed, should not be afraid ofcriticism and open debate.5 Mao also spoke positively of those involved in laborunrest andstudentdemonstrations,sincetheir actionshadhelpedcreatepressurefor the party to improve.

In 1956 and the firsthalf of 1957, millions of peasants had retreated from the rural collectives andreturned to producing as individual farmers. Mao himself was enraged at evidencethat evenmany rural cadres were still not convinced of the superiority of socialistagriculture.The wider party leadership feared that anti-socialist forces in the citiesand countryside, which up to now had worked independently of each other, couldlink up in a broader national movement.55 By cutting across classes, sucha movement couldpotentiallylead to questioning of the CCP's monopoly as solerepresentativeoftheworkers andpeasants.Whether ornotthisfearwasjustifiedinthe autumn of 1957, the party moved swiftly to tackle the perceived danger.Alongside the Anti-Rightist struggle, a new Socialist Education Campaign, directedfrom the top down, swept through the countryside, factories, and minority regionsUnlike previous campaigns, which had tended to move in cycles, the Anti-Rightist Campaign grew increasingly radical over time.

The public dining halls seem to have been popular initially, and sloganssuch as “communism means eating for free” proved attractive to the ruralpopulation.(\"Free”in this context meant that food was no longer rationed.)However, attitudes changed in 1959 as meals in the dining halls become sparser,and support for the new institutions fell still further in 196o, when distributionstopped completely in some areas. Instead of beingliberated from housework,men andwomennowhadtouse their shrinkingenergies tosearchfor orstealfood. It was not only the dining halls that failed as the famine struck: provision offood and care in the kindergartens and old people's homes was often just as poor.Although nominally liberated, women faced pressure to pick up the slack as thecare system began tofall apart,and working in thefieldsor onirrigation projectsbecame,unsurprisingly,a secondary concern for many.Mao himself continued to publicly promote the People's Communes anddining halls.Participation rates decreased in the first half of 1959,when thegovernment reduced the pressure to communize,but increased again after theLushan Conference that summer, when opposing public dining was designatedas an act of “right opportunism.” Only in 1961 were the public dining hallspermanently shut down.By this time,it was clear that the “socializationof housework”had turned into a major disaster for rural China.This didnot mean, however, that women simply returned to their old lives. Now theywere called both to work in the fields and to perform care work at home.During the day,hard labor remained,while at night,spinning and weavingweredone.21Hua'nan Gongxueyuan Jianzhuxi, Guibua sheji-Henan Sheng SuipingXian weixing renmin"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"gongshe diyi jicengshe(Hua'nan GongxueyuanJianzhuxi,1958),pp.19-24.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Between 1957 and 1958, the number of female workers inurban areas increased from 3 million to over 8 million.

The reportsteeredclearofquestioningtheworkforcereductionsthemselves,butitharshlycriticized the gendered nature of the process.Married women,who made upabout 1o percent of new female workers,were apparently at increased risk ofbeing targeted because of a belief that theburdens of housework and childcareprevented them from focusing fully on their work.24 The layoffs, however, didnot lastlong.After theLushan Conference,radicalism was once again the orderof the day, and in the second half of 1959 the government began a new wave ofmobilization.

This was the background to the substantialfallin grain production that tookplacebetween1958and196o,when statisticspublished in the Reform era indicate that China's overall grain output droppedbyaboutone-third.The decline in production was attributable to a number of factors: the chaos thataccompanied the introduction of the larger communes; poor labor performanceleading toreducedproductivity;andgenerallabor shortages in agriculture.Naturaldisastersandunfavorableclimaticconditions alsoplayedakeyrole,butno seriousWestern or Chinese scholar regardsbad weather as themajor reason fonthe famine.

In many regions, the rural population received no grain at all, and peoplewere left trying to survive on supplements, such as sweet potato stems or cornhusks,whichoftenlackedanynutritionalvalue.Despitethefamine,the centralgovernment continued to export large quantities of grain to the Soviet Union andEastern Europe to service debts for industrial aid. In 1959, China exported4.74 million tons of grain, and even at the height of the famine in 1960another million tons were sent overseas.Although this represented only a smallpercentage of the overall harvest, in terms of the numbers who died it waspotentially decisive.

The spark for this secondslideintoradicalism camefromMao'soutspokenDefenseMinisterPengDehuai,a hero of the Korean War, who criticized the steel campaign in a personal letter tothe chairman.Mao sensed an attack on the Great Leap and on his own authority,and a recent visit byPeng totheUSSR and Eastern Europe,encouraged him to seehints of a Soviet-backed plot against his leadership. He responded with some force,dismissing Peng from office and attacking him and his supporters as an “anti-party,anti-socialist clique.” It was the first time since 1949 that a member of the innercircle of the party leadership had been purged for expressing criticism internally.Since the 192os,the CCP leadership had used the concept of “left and rightdeviations” to criticize party members who strayed too far from the correctpoliticalline.Now,inthelightofPeng'sletter,anewcategoryoferrorwasdevisedtodealwithopponentsoftheGreatLeap.TheCentralCommitteedefined “right opportunism” as doubting the achievements of, or resistanceagainst,the Three Red Banners,namely the generalline of socialist construction,theprosecutionoftheGreatLeapForwardandtheestablishmentofthePeople'sCommunes.“Rightopportunistic”tendencies inside the party wereviewed as anexpression of class struggle in society and as the result of residual bourgeoisideology. In November 1959, the Central Committee stressed that this labelshould not be used for members of the democratic parties, capitalists or bour-geois intellectuals.Through the United Front Work Department, the leadershipmade clear that these groups had already been re-educated during the Anti-Rightist Campaign and that the label of “right opportunism” should thereforebe reserved exclusively for the struggle within the CCP.3838“Zhonggong zhongyang pizhuan zhongyang tongzhanbu‘Guanyu minzhudangpai,zichanjieji-fenzi he zichanjieji zhishifenzi zhong bu jinxing fanyouqing douzheng de zhengfeng yundong deyijian',” in Zhongyang dang'an guan (ed.), Zhonggong zhongyang wenxian xuanji (Beijing:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Renmin chubanshe,2013),Vol.32,P.33.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

During the Great Leap Famine, different parts of the country were hitat different times,and some areas survived almost entirely unaffected.Many pea-sants from central China fled west to Qinghai and Xinjiang, where labor was neededas local authorities attempted to open up waste land for agriculture.PeasantsI interviewed in Xinyang, Henan, told me that in their village all the young men,including cadres and militia men, migrated to Qinghai during the famine.

The Chinese demographer Peng Xizhe gives a national figure ofroughly 23 million excess deaths between 1958 and 1962.At the upper end ofthe range, a group of Western academics argue for 3o million excess deaths,including 12.2 million children under the age of ten years.54 The main reason forthis wide variation is the need to factor in unregistered births and deaths, twovariables which by definition can never be dependably known. This need isparticularlyacute in the Chinese case given theimperfectionsin the state'spopulation registration system, particularly in the early decades of the PRC.In addition, the introduction of the birth planning system, which penalizesparents who have more than the prescribed number of children,has resulted inmillions of births going unreported - the so-called “black children” born illicitlyin households across China.A final difficulty arises because the reliability ofpopulation data appears tovaryfrom province toprovince.Even with an accurate picture of births and deaths,excess mortality can onlybe measured compared to death rates in“ordinary”periods.How to define thisbaseline for the years between 1959 and 1961 is a complex question, since deathrates in the years before the famine are by no means accurately known. Officialstatistics show that China's overalldeathrateandrate of childmortalitywerehigh before 1949.Thereafter,the yearsbetween 1949 and 1957 saw a dramaticdecrease in the reported death rate,from about twenty-five per thousand to tenper thousand in less than a decade. If true, this would have meant over 3o millionlives “saved\"by the economic and social change of the early Mao years.Thehistoricaldemographer Cormac O'Gradacasts doubt onthesefigures,however, arguing that such a precipitous drop over such a short period isimplausible.If we accept his claim that the reduction of the death rate between1949 and 1957 was less significant than reported, then the overall death rateimmediatelybeforethefaminemusthavebeenhigher thanhaspreviouslybeenacknowledged. The rise in the overall death rate (which peaked at 25.43 perthousand during the Great Leap) would then be correspondingly less severe,meaning fewer excessdeathsattributable tothe famine.Taking these54Peng Xizhe,“Demographic Consequences of the Great Leap Forward in China's Provinces,”Population and Development Review,Vol. 13, No.4 (1987),p.649; Basil Ashton, et al.“Famine in China,1958-1961,”Population and Development Review,Vol.1o,No.4(1984),"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"P.619.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The death rate of around twenty-five per thousandduring the Great LeapFamine was thereforelower than thatseen during“normaltimes”inRepublicanChina,makingitunlikely,intheviewofthesescholars,thata famine causing tens of millions of deaths could actually have occurred.58The narrative of the Great Leap Forward as the “largest famine in humanhistory,” they assert, was created by anti-communist scholars bent on slanderingtheachievementsofMaoera.55O'Grada,Famine,p.96.56 Cao Shuji, Da jihuang (Hong Kong: Shidai guoji chuban youxiangongsi, 2oo5), p. 282.57 Cormac O'Grada,“Making Famine History,”Journal of Economic Literature,Vol. 45, No. 1(2007),p.23.58LiMinqi,TheRiseofChinaandtheDemiseoftheCapitalistWorldEconomy(London:Pluto"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Press, 20o8), Pp. 4I-42.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

First, and most obvious, thefact that millions of lives were saved due to the improvements in public healthbetween 1949 and 1957, while welcome in itself, did nothing to prevent peoplefrom starving to death during the subsequent famine. Improvements in healthcare and hygiene meant that, by 1957, millions of babies had survived to the ageofonewhomightotherwisehavedied.Thisdoesnotmean,however,thatthereturn to high levels of child mortality seen during the famine did not actuallytake place.Second,the comparison with death rates under the Republic has onlylimited validity in statistical terms. Before 1945, the GMD ruled over less thanhalf the country.In this period of permanent violence, civil war and Japaneseoccupation, no representative population surveys were ever produced that cangive us a reliable picture of death rates across China as a whole. Moreover, thecomparisonbetweendeathratesduringtheGreatLeapanddeathrates asa whole under the GMD is not like-for-like.Although early deaths caused bypoor living conditions in “normal times” are important, they must be distin-guished from famines, when death rates suddenly sky-rocket and then declineafter reachingapeak.Rough estimatesfor excess mortalitydue tofamine andnatural disaster under the Republic range from around 15 to 18 million people -that is, fewer deaths than the Great Leap Famine, spread over a much longerperiod.59 It is certainly appropriate to view the Great Leap Famine in its largerhistorical context, as the Neo-Maoist camp attempts to do.However,we shouldnot overlookwhat seems to me tobe the key element of this context,namely thatthe famine of 1958 to1961 broke out not in a time of war or limited statecapacity,but during a period of peace and economic growth.The apologistargumentthattheGreatLeapclaimedonlyafewmillionlivesfliesinthefaceof serious demographic studies, backed by solid statistical analysis and surveydata.It also fails to note perhaps the most tragic aspect of the disaster: that itcouldhavebeenavoided.The End of the United Front and the Uprising in TibetAs wehaveseen,theCCP's accommodationwith theTibetan authoritieshadallowedtheregiontodeferLandReformandtheestablishmentofthePeople'sCommunesallthewaytotheendofthe195os.ThismadeTibetsomethingofa special case.

This campaign had extraordinarily severe consequences,leading todamage tovastswathes ofgrassland and an intensification of existingconflictsbetween sedentary peasants and nomadic herdsmen. Grain production on newlyopened arable land remained very low,and the accompanying effort to settlenomads and “unite agriculture and animal husbandry” sparked the loss of morethan a third of the province's cattle stocks, which declined from 15 million headin 1957 to 1o.8 million in 1958 and 9.3 million in 196o.6° As a result, theherdsmen'smeatrationsdecreasedwithoutanyriseingrainoutputtooffsetthe loss.

The greater the disorder is there, thebetter. If the reactionaries in Tibet dare to launch an overall rebellion, then thelaboring people there can be liberated earlier.\"62 On July 14, the CentralCommittee claimed that“reactionaries”in Tibet might be preparing to initiatean armed revolt, which the PLA should be prepared to crush. However, it stuck toits decision to postpone reforms in Tibet, expressing the hope that the localTibetan governmentwould continue to support the195o compromise.Itwasanother nine months before the uprising Mao had envisioned actually broke out.After rumors spread that the PLA planned to kidnap the Dalai Lama,massdemonstrations erupted in Lhasa on March 13, 1959, and soon a full-blownrebellion was in progress.Among the rebels were both guerrilla fighters fromQinghaiandtheTibetanarmy,whichhadremainedindependentofthePLAafterTibet's incorporation into the PRC.

Attacking the Soviet-American rappro-chement and the notion of “peaceful coexistence” between capitalism and soci-alism, the CCP leadership insisted that US imperialism was inherently aggressiveand that violent revolutions must be supported as the only way to “liberate\"people in the non-Western world.69 These critiques amounted to an indirectquestioningoftheUSSR'sleadershipoftheglobalcommunistmovement.Given that millions of Chinese were starving to death as the article was publishedthe momentfor open confrontation was,withhindsight,ill chosen.OnJuly18,Khrushchev,theSovietPremier,orderedthesuddenwithdrawalofaboutI,4ooSovietexpertsfromChina.Whiletheactindicatedseveredisplea-sure and harmed numerous industrial projects, the notion occasionally advancedthat it was the withdrawal of Soviet support that led to the disaster in thecountrysideislargelywithoutmerit.None of thelostSovietspecialists appeartohave been working directly on agricultural production.7°Likewise,Mao'ssubsequent push to repay China's debts to the USSR within five years wasa deliberate choice to reduce the country's dependency on its Soviet “elderbrother.” At least in the first half of 196o, saving the lives of famine victimswas apparentlynotthechairman'stoppriority.68 Ibid., p. 177.69 “Lieningzhuyi wansui,” in JGYL,Vol. 13, P. 279.7oLorenzLithi,TheSino-SovietSplit:ColdWarintheCommunistWorld(Princeton,NJ:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Princeton UniversityPress,2oo8),p.178.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Some scholars consideritprimarilyapreludetothestartof theCulturalRevolutioninthesummer of1966.3 In this reading, the years between 1962 and 1966 represent a period ofgradualintensification.Sino-Sovietconflictescalatedinpublic withopenpolemics by the CCP against “Soviet revisionism.”Mao warned ofa“restoration of capitalism”in China.The threat of conflict also increasedwith theUS move towardsdirect involvement in theVietnamWar,startingwith the systematicbombing of socialist NorthVietnam in 1965.On the other hand,the periodbetween1962 and summer 1966could alsobeconsidered a time of recovery. The rural population had been hit terribly by thefamine, and many people had to rebuild families and homes. In some parts of thecountry the famine was still in progress in 1962. In Sichuan province, peasantscontinued to starve thatyear,and recovery would not begin in earnest until1963.4 At the same time,China as a whole experienced a baby boom in1962-1963 that resulted in potentially worrying levels of population growth.In other words,the early 196os saw contradictory developments in differentpolicy fields and different sectors of society.A rough periodization of these years,whichis perhaps thebest we can hope for,could distinguishbetween twophases:1. The time between early 1961 and late 1962,when the central governmentfocused on the “readjustment”of the economy to overcome the famine.2.A more radical period inaugurated with Mao's warning to“never forgetclass struggle\"after the IothPlenum of the 8th Central Committeein September 1962.

However, the party leadership quicklybecame divided on the question of how far any concessions should go.The policies of the “readjustment” resulted in economic recovery, but they alsosetthestageformanysocialconflictsthatwouldescalateduringtheCulturalRevolution.The GreatDownsizingA number of scholars have argued that the recovery of China's agricultural sectorwasprimarilydowntoreformstotheownershipstructureofthePeople'sCommunes.Thekeydocumentinthese reforms,the so-called“6oPointsinAgriculture”of 1961,defined the structure of the communes as consisting ofthree levels.At the top sat the commune itself, and below it the productionbrigade and finally the production team, formed from severalindividual families.Under the“6oPoints,”collective ownership and the accounting of work pointsweretobemanaged primarily attheleveloftheproductionteam,thelowest rungon the ladder. Commune members were entitled to plots for private use anda small number oflivestock.Although these reforms were important -primarily because they createdgreater incentives for peasants to increase production - they are only part ofthe story.

Both argued for a reduction of the urbanworkforce and for importing grain to restore the balance between urban con-sumersandnetgrainproducersinthecountryside.ChenYuninparticularbelieved that the uncontrolled growth of the urban population had been themajor reason, not just for the famine, but also for smaller dislocations in thegrain supply in 1953,1954 and 1957.°Fewer consumers entitled to urban rationcards would mean reduced pressure onthe state toextractgrainfrom thecountryside tofeed the cities.Not only would this rebalancing increase thenumber of agricultural workers,but crucially it would also reduce the overallamount of grain needed for the country as a whole,since much smaller rationswereprovidedtorural residentsthanthosewith anurbanhukouwere entitled to.Chen also argued that the restoration of plots for private use in the People'sCommunes would allow those whowere sent downfrom the cities tobe self-supporting.7Taking thevolume of agriculturalproductionandthenumbersofurbanconsumersoftradegrainintoaccount,Chenestimatedin1962that2omillionpeople needed to be sent back to the countryside from the cities and towns(chengzhen).Recent migrants who had come to urban areas during the GreatLeap became the main target of the “downsizing” policy.In total, 26 millionpeople were removed between late 196o and 1963.* Table 5.1 outlines thereductionof theworkforceofthestate-ownedenterprises:8.7millionin1961and8.6 million in1962.By contrast,the number ofworkers in collectively ownedenterprises,where entitlements were more restricted,actually increased slightlyduring these years. Assessing the exact effect of Chen and Li's recovery plan onthe urban population is complicated by the fact that statistics from the periodalmostinvariablycountpartsofthesuburbanpopulationthatwereactuallyengagedin agriculturalproduction as urban residents.Taking this statisticalanomaly into account, it seems that non-agrarian urban residents never consti-tuted more than 2o percent of the Chinese population during the Mao era.

The leadership of theCCP hadlearned importantlessons from thefamine.These measures alone, however, were still inadequate to stabilize the system offood supply in the post-famine years. Reform had to be coupled with immediaterelief via grain imports. As Chen Yun argued: “If we import grain, we can takeless from the peasants,stabilize their attitude toward production,and raise theenthusiasm of thepeasantsforproduction.If we take two or threeyearstodevelop agricultural production, the problems of the internal market can besolved.\"10Between1961and1965,Chinaimportedonaverage5milliontonsof grain each year; net imports stood at around 4.18 million tons per annum.11Rather than being sent to famine-hit rural areas, this grain was used to supplyBeijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Liaoning. All four areas were part of the urbansupplysystem administereddirectlybythecentralgovernment,andtheimportstherefore constituted a kind of indirect famine relief, reducing the burden onpeasants to meet grain quotas and allowing more grain to remain in the villages.9 Yuan Yongxi (ed.),Zhongguo renkou zonglun,p.277.I0 Quoted in:Jin Chongji(ed.),Zhou Enlai zhuan(Beijing:Zhongyang wenxian chubanshe,1998),Vol.4,p.1565.11 LuoPinghan,Da qian xi:1961-1963 nian de chengzhen renkou jing jian (Nanning: Guangxi"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"renmin chubanshe,2oo3),p.118.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The minorSichuanese city of Panzhihua,for instance,was selected as a center for steelproduction.Parts of Qinghai,Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei and Hunan were laterincluded in the program as well.

In addition to the regular labor market andschools,a kind of “second-class”system with less funding and reduced entitle-ments was created to meet demand without overburdening the state.As a result,by 1964 the urban workforce had begun to increase again (see Table 5.1).The reason for the introduction of the so-called“dual system”in labor wassimple.Manyfactoriesrequired new workerstomeet their production targets.However, the central government was reluctant to increase the number of peopleon the state's payroll, a move that had backfired so spectacularly during the GreatLeap.

Mining was known to lead tosevere health problems, and Liu therefore proposed that workers should berecruitedintotheminesonlyforafewyearsbeforebeingmandatorilydis-charged.While he was careful to frame his arguments in terms of workersinterests, “mandatory discharge” had the convenient side-effect of turning anentire industry into short-term contract work.His speechwas rooted above allnot in the socialist logic of worker entitlements,but in the government's desire toreducecosts.The second strand of the dual system was education.During the Great Leap,theCCP's drive toexpand schools and increase student numbershad createda tremendous additional burden for the central state and local governments. Norwasthemoneynecessarilywellspent.Standardsinmanyofthenewschoolswerelow,and learning was often made more difficult by thefact that significantnumbers of students were going hungry.In February 1961,the CentralCommittee circulated a document arguing that more young labor power wasneeded for agricultural production.To free up this labor, it was decided thatstudents above the age of sixteenyears should not exceed2percent of the totalrural laborforce over thenext threetofiveyears.Primary andmiddle schoolsshould avoidenrolling students whohadpassed theregular agefor schoolingand the number of students in regular and agriculture middle schools should bekept steady.²3Thedecision significantlycurtailedopportunitiesforpeasantchildren to attend higher middle school.

Liu contended that resistance to the campaign was beingdriven by corrupt local cadres backed by “rich peasants.\"Mao,however,argued that local cadres were receiving support from high-level “capitalistroaders inside the party.\"33 If the higher echelons of the CCP were complicitin maintaining the bad practices seen in rural areas,then thehuge outsidework teams being sent into the villages to promote the Four Clean Ups mightthemselves be compromised.Mao's view carried the day,and the strategywasabandoned.Crackdown on the“Black Wind\"in theRural EconomyIn 1961,Mao was willing to accept a relaxation of state control in the country-sidein orderto achieve economicrecovery.Nevertheless,hewaskeentosetlimitstoensurethatcentralpowerwasnotreducedexcessively.Soon aftertherelease ofthe “6o Points for the People's Communes,”he defined a“bottom line” for howfar reforms could go.Experiments in several provinces, notably Anhui, hadstrengthenedthehouseholdresponsibilitysystem,underwhichpeasantfamilieswere the units of production and responsible for the grain fulfilling quotas, at theexpense of the larger commune.

The order had to be maderepeatedly because,in contrast to the cities,most peasants,except those whowere party members, still had no personal files by the early 196os.

The Central Committee deter-mined that members of the party and the mass organizations should be permittedto marry descendants of landlords and rich peasants, provided that the memberconcerned showed the correct class attitude.Nonetheless,such unions were stillviewed by the partyleadership as a possible source ofmoral corruption andtreated with suspicion. Even non-party members faced barriers to inter-classmarriage. For instance, anyone with ambitions to join either the CCP or thearmyhadtobepreparedtoprovideinformationabouttheir“socialrelations\"during the applicationprocess.Atleast during the 196os,candidates thereforehad to think twice about marrying someone with a bad class background. At thelocal level, the central leadership seems to have been caught between twoextremes.Ontheonehand,somecadreswhollydeniedthecontinuednecessityof class struggle; on the other,many made no distinction between the status ofparents and their adult children, treating the two generations equally harshly.Both attitudes ran contrary to the official policy, which was to enforce the classline while providing a “way out” for young people with a bad family backgroundbutgoodperformance.Perhaps the mostimportantelementofthis policywas thecontrol it gave the CCP over rural class status.

Instead, their explanations concentrated on private ownership structuresand the unequal distribution of wealth.In 1949,Maohimself had rejected theargument that the size of China's population would ever present a problem,46and the newlyfoundedPeople'sRepublicintroduced Soviet-style natalistpoliciesthat encouraged additional births (see Chapter 2).More children would meanastrongernation.Things began to change with the publication of a major set of populationsurveys in 1953.These revealed that China's total population was already above6oomillion,amuchhighernumberthanhadbeenanticipated.Inresponse,somecadresfromboth theparty and theWomen'sFederationbegan to callforbirthcontrol to improve the health of women and children.

With these decisions, the state took on a new role.planning not only production, but also reproduction. One notable aspect of thenew birth planning regime was that it was first implemented in the urban areas,where initial schemes started as early as 1963.Work in the cities was expected toprovide the impetus for expanding birth planning to selected areas in the country-side.Therationaleforstartingwiththecitiescamefromabelief,sharedbyZhouEnlai and a number ofothercentralleaders,that thenewpolicieswould beeasiertoimplementinurbanareasbecauseoftheirbetterdevelopedpublichealthsystems and the comparatively high level of education of most urban women.The content of the birth planning policy was modeled on pilot projects in thenorthern port city of Tianjin, offeringfree sterilization and abortions.A key argument for birth planning in the cities was that it would ease theburden on thepeasants by reducing the number ofurban consumers ofgrain.Forinstance,adocumentproducedbytheUrbanWorkConferencein1962explicitlystated thatbirth planningwould“control the growthof theurbanpopulation;reduce the burden on the peasants; [and] relax the tight situation in the supply ofessentialgoods,aswellasinhousing,schooling,andotherfacilitiesprovidedbythe municipal administration.\"48 In a speech in July 1963, Zhou Enlai arguedthatasocialisttheoryofpopulationwasneededtoallowforeffectivegovernmentmanagement. The first argument he offered in favor of birth planning was thatthe uncontrolled increase of the urban population between 1957 and 196o hadresulted in a high burden on the state.49 The year after Zhou's speech, birthplanningwasextendedtosomeofthemoredenselypopulatedruralareas.Published documents never linked the new policies to the famine,but theymade repeated references to the grain problem.As suggested above, anothercommon argument was that birth planning and birth control would improvewomen's health.Ultimately,however,the introduction of birth planning shouldbe seen in the context of the leadership's desire to control the growth of thepopulation (particularly in urban areas) and the resultant expenses of the state.48 “Zhonggong zhongyang, guowuyuan pizhun “Di er ci chengshi gongzuo huiyi jiyao” de zhishi,\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"in JGYL,Vol.17,Pp.298-299.49 Zhou Enlai, “Yinggai queli shehuizhuyi renkou lun de zhengque guannian,” in JGYL, Vol. 16,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"P.543.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In Taixing county, Jiangsu province, the grainshortage ran to 65,000 kilograms, of which more than 25,000 kilograms had been embezzled or stolenThe amount of grain and oil embezzled by the two corrupt groups operating in Wujin county and Nantongcountyexceeded20,000kilograms4. Disorder in regulation and documentation resulting in a large amount of grain going missingFrom last November to this March, eleven rail cars of grain ordered by the Lanzhou Municipal GrainAdministration Bureau from Xianyang, Shaanxi province went missing (a total loss of 315,000 kilograms)The case remained uninvestigated. Only 160 of the 320 bags of standard flour ordered from Fuyu Flour Millbythe Xi'an Baqiao District Grain Administration Bureau were received, and the remaining 160 bags wentmissing. A stock check revealed that the transportation unit had lost the billof lading, and the delivery unit hadno record of shipping that could be used for further investigation5. Improper storage, serious deterioration. Due to improper storage, 200,000 kilograms of grain havedeteriorated in Huating county, Gansu province, while a further 810,oo0 kilograms are on the point ofdeterioration.

Some scholars consideritprimarilyapreludetothestartof theCulturalRevolutioninthesummer of1966.3 In this reading, the years between 1962 and 1966 represent a period ofgradualintensification.Sino-Sovietconflictescalatedinpublic withopenpolemics by the CCP against “Soviet revisionism.”Mao warned ofa“restoration of capitalism”in China.The threat of conflict also increasedwith theUS move towardsdirect involvement in theVietnamWar,startingwith the systematicbombing of socialist NorthVietnam in 1965.On the other hand,the periodbetween1962 and summer 1966could alsobeconsidered a time of recovery. The rural population had been hit terribly by thefamine, and many people had to rebuild families and homes. In some parts of thecountry the famine was still in progress in 1962. In Sichuan province, peasantscontinued to starve thatyear,and recovery would not begin in earnest until1963.4 At the same time,China as a whole experienced a baby boom in1962-1963 that resulted in potentially worrying levels of population growth.In other words,the early 196os saw contradictory developments in differentpolicy fields and different sectors of society.A rough periodization of these years,whichis perhaps thebest we can hope for,could distinguishbetween twophases:1. The time between early 1961 and late 1962,when the central governmentfocused on the “readjustment”of the economy to overcome the famine.2.A more radical period inaugurated with Mao's warning to“never forgetclass struggle\"after the IothPlenum of the 8th Central Committeein September 1962.

However, the party leadership quicklybecame divided on the question of how far any concessions should go.The policies of the “readjustment” resulted in economic recovery, but they alsosetthestageformanysocialconflictsthatwouldescalateduringtheCulturalRevolution.The GreatDownsizingA number of scholars have argued that the recovery of China's agricultural sectorwasprimarilydowntoreformstotheownershipstructureofthePeople'sCommunes.Thekeydocumentinthese reforms,the so-called“6oPointsinAgriculture”of 1961,defined the structure of the communes as consisting ofthree levels.At the top sat the commune itself, and below it the productionbrigade and finally the production team, formed from severalindividual families.Under the“6oPoints,”collective ownership and the accounting of work pointsweretobemanaged primarily attheleveloftheproductionteam,thelowest rungon the ladder. Commune members were entitled to plots for private use anda small number oflivestock.Although these reforms were important -primarily because they createdgreater incentives for peasants to increase production - they are only part ofthe story.

Both argued for a reduction of the urbanworkforce and for importing grain to restore the balance between urban con-sumersandnetgrainproducersinthecountryside.ChenYuninparticularbelieved that the uncontrolled growth of the urban population had been themajor reason, not just for the famine, but also for smaller dislocations in thegrain supply in 1953,1954 and 1957.°Fewer consumers entitled to urban rationcards would mean reduced pressure onthe state toextractgrainfrom thecountryside tofeed the cities.Not only would this rebalancing increase thenumber of agricultural workers,but crucially it would also reduce the overallamount of grain needed for the country as a whole,since much smaller rationswereprovidedtorural residentsthanthosewith anurbanhukouwere entitled to.Chen also argued that the restoration of plots for private use in the People'sCommunes would allow those whowere sent downfrom the cities tobe self-supporting.7Taking thevolume of agriculturalproductionandthenumbersofurbanconsumersoftradegrainintoaccount,Chenestimatedin1962that2omillionpeople needed to be sent back to the countryside from the cities and towns(chengzhen).Recent migrants who had come to urban areas during the GreatLeap became the main target of the “downsizing” policy.In total, 26 millionpeople were removed between late 196o and 1963.* Table 5.1 outlines thereductionof theworkforceofthestate-ownedenterprises:8.7millionin1961and8.6 million in1962.By contrast,the number ofworkers in collectively ownedenterprises,where entitlements were more restricted,actually increased slightlyduring these years. Assessing the exact effect of Chen and Li's recovery plan onthe urban population is complicated by the fact that statistics from the periodalmostinvariablycountpartsofthesuburbanpopulationthatwereactuallyengagedin agriculturalproduction as urban residents.Taking this statisticalanomaly into account, it seems that non-agrarian urban residents never consti-tuted more than 2o percent of the Chinese population during the Mao era.

The leadership of theCCP hadlearned importantlessons from thefamine.These measures alone, however, were still inadequate to stabilize the system offood supply in the post-famine years. Reform had to be coupled with immediaterelief via grain imports. As Chen Yun argued: “If we import grain, we can takeless from the peasants,stabilize their attitude toward production,and raise theenthusiasm of thepeasantsforproduction.If we take two or threeyearstodevelop agricultural production, the problems of the internal market can besolved.\"10Between1961and1965,Chinaimportedonaverage5milliontonsof grain each year; net imports stood at around 4.18 million tons per annum.11Rather than being sent to famine-hit rural areas, this grain was used to supplyBeijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Liaoning. All four areas were part of the urbansupplysystem administereddirectlybythecentralgovernment,andtheimportstherefore constituted a kind of indirect famine relief, reducing the burden onpeasants to meet grain quotas and allowing more grain to remain in the villages.9 Yuan Yongxi (ed.),Zhongguo renkou zonglun,p.277.I0 Quoted in:Jin Chongji(ed.),Zhou Enlai zhuan(Beijing:Zhongyang wenxian chubanshe,1998),Vol.4,p.1565.11 LuoPinghan,Da qian xi:1961-1963 nian de chengzhen renkou jing jian (Nanning: Guangxi"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"renmin chubanshe,2oo3),p.118.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The minorSichuanese city of Panzhihua,for instance,was selected as a center for steelproduction.Parts of Qinghai,Gansu, Shaanxi, Hubei and Hunan were laterincluded in the program as well. The relocation of industry accelerated thestandardization ofregionaltransportationnetworks.Newrailwayconstructionlinked up cities in the interior, adding over 8,ooo kilometers of track to theChinese rail systembetween 1964 and 198o.17 Major trunk lines such as theI5LorenzLithi,“TheVietnamWar and China'sThird-LineDefensePlanningbefore the CulturalRevolution, 1964-1966,\" Journal of Cold War Studies,Vol. 1o, No. 1,(2o08), p. 27.16 Barry Naughton,“The Third Front:Defense Industrialization in the ChineseInterior,\"TheChinaQuarterly,No.115(1988),p.365.17 Covell Meyskens,“Third Front Railroads and Industrial Modernity in Late Maoist China,\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Twentieth-Century China,Vol.3,No.3(2o15),p.246.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

In addition to the regular labor market andschools,a kind of “second-class”system with less funding and reduced entitle-ments was created to meet demand without overburdening the state.As a result,by 1964 the urban workforce had begun to increase again (see Table 5.1).The reason for the introduction of the so-called“dual system”in labor wassimple.Manyfactoriesrequired new workerstomeet their production targets.However, the central government was reluctant to increase the number of peopleon the state's payroll, a move that had backfired so spectacularly during the GreatLeap.

Mining was known to lead tosevere health problems, and Liu therefore proposed that workers should berecruitedintotheminesonlyforafewyearsbeforebeingmandatorilydis-charged.While he was careful to frame his arguments in terms of workersinterests, “mandatory discharge” had the convenient side-effect of turning anentire industry into short-term contract work.His speechwas rooted above allnot in the socialist logic of worker entitlements,but in the government's desire toreducecosts.The second strand of the dual system was education.During the Great Leap,theCCP's drive toexpand schools and increase student numbershad createda tremendous additional burden for the central state and local governments. Norwasthemoneynecessarilywellspent.Standardsinmanyofthenewschoolswerelow,and learning was often made more difficult by thefact that significantnumbers of students were going hungry.In February 1961,the CentralCommittee circulated a document arguing that more young labor power wasneeded for agricultural production.To free up this labor, it was decided thatstudents above the age of sixteenyears should not exceed2percent of the totalrural laborforce over thenext threetofiveyears.Primary andmiddle schoolsshould avoidenrolling students whohadpassed theregular agefor schoolingand the number of students in regular and agriculture middle schools should bekept steady.²3Thedecision significantlycurtailedopportunitiesforpeasantchildren to attend higher middle school.

Liu stoodaccused of discriminatingagainst the children of ordinarypeople,whowere onlyallowed to learn the basic skills necessary to perform hard labor for others.25At the same time, critics alleged,children of intellectuals and urban cadresenjoyed a better education in the regular system or at elite “key-point” schools.Itwasdisingenuoustodirectthesecriticisms atLiuandDengalone.Liu,afteralldid not personally devise the dual system, and all the evidence suggests that Maowas initially supportive of it.

The order had to be maderepeatedly because,in contrast to the cities,most peasants,except those whowere party members, still had no personal files by the early 196os.

The Central Committee deter-mined that members of the party and the mass organizations should be permittedto marry descendants of landlords and rich peasants, provided that the memberconcerned showed the correct class attitude.Nonetheless,such unions were stillviewed by the partyleadership as a possible source ofmoral corruption andtreated with suspicion. Even non-party members faced barriers to inter-classmarriage. For instance, anyone with ambitions to join either the CCP or thearmyhadtobepreparedtoprovideinformationabouttheir“socialrelations\"during the applicationprocess.Atleast during the 196os,candidates thereforehad to think twice about marrying someone with a bad class background. At thelocal level, the central leadership seems to have been caught between twoextremes.Ontheonehand,somecadreswhollydeniedthecontinuednecessityof class struggle; on the other,many made no distinction between the status ofparents and their adult children, treating the two generations equally harshly.Both attitudes ran contrary to the official policy, which was to enforce the classline while providing a “way out” for young people with a bad family backgroundbutgoodperformance.Perhaps the mostimportantelementofthis policywas thecontrol it gave the CCP over rural class status.

Instead, their explanations concentrated on private ownership structuresand the unequal distribution of wealth.In 1949,Maohimself had rejected theargument that the size of China's population would ever present a problem,46and the newlyfoundedPeople'sRepublicintroduced Soviet-style natalistpoliciesthat encouraged additional births (see Chapter 2).More children would meanastrongernation.Things began to change with the publication of a major set of populationsurveys in 1953.These revealed that China's total population was already above6oomillion,amuchhighernumberthanhadbeenanticipated.Inresponse,somecadresfromboth theparty and theWomen'sFederationbegan to callforbirthcontrol to improve the health of women and children. Mao himself expressedconcern that the state would have difficulty feeding the rising population,but hisattitude changed in 1958,when increasing the labor power of the masses becamea central themeof GreatLeapeconomic strategy.After thefamine,thedebatewas reopened.47Despite millions of deaths,thebirth rate rebounded swiftly,andthe baby boom of 1963 and 1964 took the national population to 704 million,compared to659 million in1958.The evidence of the Chinese caseundermines46 Mao Zedong,“Weixin lishiguan de pochan,” in Mao Zedong Xuanji (Beijing: Renmin chu-banshe, 1967), Vol. 4, Pp.1448-1449.47For an overview see:TyreneWhite,China'sLongest Campaign:BirthPlanning in thePeople's"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Republic, 1949-2005 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2006), Pp. 19-41.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

With these decisions, the state took on a new role.planning not only production, but also reproduction. One notable aspect of thenew birth planning regime was that it was first implemented in the urban areas,where initial schemes started as early as 1963.Work in the cities was expected toprovide the impetus for expanding birth planning to selected areas in the country-side.Therationaleforstartingwiththecitiescamefromabelief,sharedbyZhouEnlai and a number ofothercentralleaders,that thenewpolicieswould beeasiertoimplementinurbanareasbecauseoftheirbetterdevelopedpublichealthsystems and the comparatively high level of education of most urban women.The content of the birth planning policy was modeled on pilot projects in thenorthern port city of Tianjin, offeringfree sterilization and abortions.A key argument for birth planning in the cities was that it would ease theburden on thepeasants by reducing the number ofurban consumers ofgrain.Forinstance,adocumentproducedbytheUrbanWorkConferencein1962explicitlystated thatbirth planningwould“control the growthof theurbanpopulation;reduce the burden on the peasants; [and] relax the tight situation in the supply ofessentialgoods,aswellasinhousing,schooling,andotherfacilitiesprovidedbythe municipal administration.\"48 In a speech in July 1963, Zhou Enlai arguedthatasocialisttheoryofpopulationwasneededtoallowforeffectivegovernmentmanagement. The first argument he offered in favor of birth planning was thatthe uncontrolled increase of the urban population between 1957 and 196o hadresulted in a high burden on the state.49 The year after Zhou's speech, birthplanningwasextendedtosomeofthemoredenselypopulatedruralareas.Published documents never linked the new policies to the famine,but theymade repeated references to the grain problem.As suggested above, anothercommon argument was that birth planning and birth control would improvewomen's health.Ultimately,however,the introduction of birth planning shouldbe seen in the context of the leadership's desire to control the growth of thepopulation (particularly in urban areas) and the resultant expenses of the state.48 “Zhonggong zhongyang, guowuyuan pizhun “Di er ci chengshi gongzuo huiyi jiyao” de zhishi,\""},{"type":"paragraph","text":"in JGYL,Vol.17,Pp.298-299.49 Zhou Enlai, “Yinggai queli shehuizhuyi renkou lun de zhengque guannian,” in JGYL, Vol. 16,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"P.543.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Thesehad been accumulated from unreported surplus grain, over-reporting of grain sales, under-reporting of riceyields,over-reported or misreported deficitsand unreported surpluses2 .Enormous deficits and losses.Primary investigations conducted in more than 900 grain storagefacilities, warehouses, factories and stations in Jiangsu province found a total shortage of 4.505 millionkilograms of grain. A shortage of more than 35,500 kilograms, accounting for 41 percent of total grainstorage, was found in Qinghan grain store in Gucheng county,Hebei province.3. Corruption and theft leading to serious grain losses. In Taixing county, Jiangsu province, the grainshortage ran to 65,000 kilograms, of which more than 25,000 kilograms had been embezzled or stolenThe amount of grain and oil embezzled by the two corrupt groups operating in Wujin county and Nantongcountyexceeded20,000kilograms4. Disorder in regulation and documentation resulting in a large amount of grain going missingFrom last November to this March, eleven rail cars of grain ordered by the Lanzhou Municipal GrainAdministration Bureau from Xianyang, Shaanxi province went missing (a total loss of 315,000 kilograms)The case remained uninvestigated. Only 160 of the 320 bags of standard flour ordered from Fuyu Flour Millbythe Xi'an Baqiao District Grain Administration Bureau were received, and the remaining 160 bags wentmissing.

Nevertheless, it is important to understand thelimits of the rebels'ambitions.Gender and the gendered division of labor were almost non-issues for the RedGuard movement that dominated the early Cultural Revolution,norwere they ontheagendaofthecentralleadership.Workersandstudentssentdowntothecountryside made frequent demands to return to the cities and regain their urbanhukou,but among theleadership theexistence ofthehukousystemitselfwas neverquestioned. Nor did any meaningful debate develop around the usefulness of thesystem of ethnic classification.Instead,ethnic conflicts escalated in Tibet and InnerMongolia, and large-scale purges were launched against so-called “local national-ists\" within the CCP.Mao made occasional critical comments regarding thehierarchical wage system,but for party and government jobs he never questionedthe distribution of wages and goods according to bureaucratic ranks. Even duringthe most turbulent period of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1968), the distributionsystem continued to function. Wages and salaries were still regularly paid in mostcases,andrationcardscontinuedtobeissuedasbefore.Themajorfeatureofthe earlyCultural Revolution wasaradicalredefinitionofthe value of age and past political accomplishments.Before1966,“revolutionarycadre”was one of the safest categories a person could occupy. Now young peopleandnon-partymembers,whohadcontributednothingtothevictoryofrevolu-tion of 1949,had an opportunity to prove their revolutionary spirit by partici-pating in the rebel movement. Even leading cadres who had helped build the CCPand thePRC statebecamevulnerableto attacks on“capitalist roadersin powerinside the party.”As early as 1964,Maohad emphasized the importance of“cultivating the successors of the revolution.\"3 The Cultural Revolution becamea test of the new generation, providing a chance for people to change their socialand political status. The personal stakes were high, and it is no surprise that, fromtheoutset,oneofthemostcontroversialissuesoftheCulturalRevolutionwaswhohad the right to participate and who did not. The generation of young peoplewho came ofage in thelate 196os had been taughttohate hidden“class enemies\"and to view violence as a necessary means to achieving the revolutionary libera-tion of mankind.

Much has also been written on Mao's goals and the shifts in hisagenda. Our knowledge of the events outside the capital and the major urbancenters is expanding,but it remains limited. There is an almost bewildering com-plexity to events in this period, partly caused by the convoluted internal dynamicsofthemovementsthemselves andpartlyduetoseveralmajoradjustmentsinMao'spolicies, which usually sparked similar turns from actors on the ground. Powerstruggles at the center overlapped with lengthy factional battles in local partyorganizations and with social conflicts at the grassroots.Different actors andplaceswerenotfixedintheirroles,butinteracteddynamicallywiththecenterand with each other. Victims and perpetrators, winners and losers changed overtime. The center of events changed too, shifting from Beijing to Shanghai in early1967 and then to Wuhan that summer. Between 1967 and 1969,China waswracked by armed conflict, some of the deadliest of which took place not in themajor urban centers,but in poorer provinces such as Sichuan and GuangxiGiven this confusing overall picture, scholars have found it difficult to agree onthe question of dating and periodization.Those who consider the CulturalRevolution to be primarily a social movement from below tend to argue that itlasted only two 0r three years,from 1966 to1968 or 1969.4Othersfollow the4Regarding this debate see:Jonathan Unger,“The Cultural Revolution at the Grass Roots,”ChinaJournal, Vol. 57(2oo7),Pp. 113-116; Susanne Weigelin-Schwiedrzik,“Coping with the Cultural"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Revolution:ContestingInterpretations,”JindaishiYanjiusuoJikan,No.61(2oo8),pp.I-52.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Compared to the grassroots rebellion and factional fightingof 1966 to 1968, politics in the late Mao era commanded little popular enthu-siasm.Most of the mass campaigns of the period were organized from the topdown, just as they had been in the pre-Cultural Revolution years.Given this turn away from grassroots movements towards more traditionalelite conflicts,the description of the entire 1966-1976period as a single“tenyears of upheaval” does not seem to me to fit the historical circumstances.We should also not lose sight of the limits to this upheaval.

At issue was the s0-called “blood-line”theory,whichaddressedthemeaningofthesystemofclassstatus,andinparticular the relationship between family origin and personal status.

In thecities,class status was directly relevant to this question.Unlike in the villages,where the majority of people occupied good class categories such as “poor andlower middle peasant,” in the cities, especially those without a major industrialbase, a large part of the population occupied theless favorable middle categories.An obvious tension existed between these groups, who needed a focus on politicalperformancetoovercometheirbadclassstatus,andthosefrombetterclass17 For the debate see:“Transcript—Grassroots Factionalism in China’s Cultural Revolution:Rethinking the Paradigm,” https://networks.h-net.org/node/3544/discussions/141257/transcript-grassroots-factionalism-china%E2%8o%99s-cultural-revolution (accessedJune19,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"20I7).Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

The document included harsh criticism of continued low livingstandards and political repression. The national economy, it declared, had beenstagnant for over ten years. The state was rich, but the people poor; peasants didnot have enough food and clothing; the“sent-down”program for urban youthwas re-education through labor by another name; workers’wages were frozen;the May 7 Cadre Schools were a hidden form of unemployment.The documentalleged that even the RedGuards now realized they had been cheated andmisused,and that theirrepressionwaslittlemorethanscapegoating.ThePLAitself was concerned about the direction of the country's development, whilecadres who shared these concerns were afraid to speak up.The author called forthe overthrow of “the modern Qinshihuang,” linking Mao to the legendarilytyrannicalfirst emperor of the Qindynasty.4In thefield offoreign relations,“Project 571” broke with prevailing policy to propose renewing the Sino-Sovietalliance.

Sending young people away from the cities also provided aneffective means to demobilize the radical Red Guards and rebels coming out ofurbanmiddleschools.Themiddleschoolgraduatesof1966,1967and1968(known collectively as the lao sanjie or“old three-classes\"）were affected morethan any other age group.In 1969 alone,over 2.67 million graduates were sentdown.

Between 1967 and 1972,the central government spent 1.7-1.8 billion yuan on these items, but the subsidiesremained too low to cover the recipients’ needs.37 The income of the “educatedyouth” in the villages was often much lower than that of the local population,because peasants had access to better plots for private use and could earn extraincome through economic sidelines.In grain deficit areas,cadres tried tokeep thegrain rations of the “educated youth\" as low as possible,38 and most peasantsconsidered the newcomers a burden on their production teams.To make up thegrain and income shortfall, many urban parents found themselves sending moneytothecountrysideonaregularbasis.The harsh conditions the “sent-down youth” experienced in the countrysideare captured in a widely publicized letter to Mao from Li Qinglin, an elementaryschool teacher in rural Fujian province, whose son had volunteered to be sent toapoormountainregion(Document7.2).Inadditiontodescribingthedifficultieshis son faced, Li criticized the corruption which allowed cadres’ children to betransferredawayfromthepoorestareas,oroutofthecountrysideentirely,onthegrounds of “necessities of development and the course of the socialist construc-tion of the state.” Those without family connections, meanwhile, faced having to37Liu Xiaomeng,Zhongguo zhiqingshi,p.192."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"38Scharping,Umsiedlungsprogramme fir ChinasJugend1955-198o,p.271.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Liargues that, under Mao, China's economic growth and rise in living standardswere both outstanding compared to other developing countries.By 1976,theCCPwas able to guarantee basic needs (food,health care, and at least primaryeducation) to the entire population. It had also laid the foundation for China'sconversion into a modernindustrial economy. Li points to the country's rate ofGDP growth between 195o and 1976 - officially 6.7 percent per annum, whichonhis readingwas thehighest of any region during this period-as furtherevidence of the CCP's success.Even accordingtoMaddison's corrected statistics,average annual growth was a strong, 4.7 percent, a figure exceeded only by WestAsia and Latin America.5° But these numbers, while impressive, fail to take49The data are from:Angus Maddison,TheWorld Economy,Volume 1:A Millennial PerspectiveVol.2:Historical Statistics (Paris: OECD,2oo6).50Li Minqi,TheRise of China and the Demise of the Capitalist World Economy (London:Pluto"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Press,2008),p.29.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Rates of illiteracy do appear to have beenhigh by the end of the Cultural Revolution.66 One study argues that the disrup-tion of schooling in these years had a noticeable negative impact on literacy,particularly for those children who turned eleven in the chaotic years between1966 and 1968.°7 In 1971, officials claimed that the illiteracy rate was as low as10 percent, or around 85 million people,but this number was disputed by theReformeraleadership.The1982censusarrivedatamuchhighernumber236million.This figure,however,is inflated by population growth and probablyalso by a further rise in illiteracy during the early Reform years, making it difficultto say what role the disruption of the Cultural Revolution may have played.What is clear from the 1982 data is that illiteracy,like so much else,wasa gendered problem.

In 195o, the CCP had 5.8 millionmembers,equivalent to 1.1 percent of the total population.By 1977, this numberhad increased markedly to 35 million, 0r 3.7 percent of the population whenpopulation growth is accounted for (see Table 7.2).Despite this increase,itshould be stressed that the CCP remained a highly selective organization -inLeninist terms, a vanguard party.

According to officialstatistics, the years between 1949 and 1961 saw an increase of the urban popula.tionfrom around1otoI9percent of the national total.Thepost-famine\"sending down” of 26 million workers reduced this to 14 percent in 1964,before a slight uptick in the following years.

Between1968 and 1976, the non-agrarian population in urban areas never exceeded12 percent of the national total, suggesting an urbanization rate much lowerthan the 17 percent cited above.71 This low rate is attributable to two majorfactors:thestrictenforcementofthehukousystemandhigherruralthanurbanbirth rates. If we think in terms of percentage rates rather than absolute figures,urban-ruralmobilitywaslowin theMaoera,especially considering the ongoingpush towards industrialization, which tended to bring new migrants into thecities.During theCultural Revolution,forinstance,millions ofpeasants wererecruited onto the state payroll and sent to work in factories.Yet, as one scholarhasargued,thismovewasultimatelypopulation-neutral,becauseitwasalmostexactlybalancedbythenumberofmiddleschoolgraduatessentdowntothecountryside under the “up to the mountains, down to the villages” program. Oneof the primarybenefits of this policy was that it allowed the state to avoid theburden of integrating these students into the labor market and the welfaresystem, thereby helping to hedge against the costs of urbanization.72Permanent employment, into which the new peasant-workers were recruited inthe 197os, was by far the most desirable form of work. It was also fast-growing.Theworkforcein the state-owned enterprisesincreasedfrom1omillionin1950to 68.6 million in 1976,while in the collectively owned enterprises the rise waseven more rapid, from 1.3 million in 1955 to 18.1 million in 1976.

In 1977, 2o million women were employed in state-owned work unitsout ofa total workforceof71 million,compared to 2.1 out of18million in1953.This was a significant improvement,but of those 2o million only around8.5 million worked in industry,a relatively low proportion.A further3.3 million worked in science, culture, education and health, 2.9 million inagriculture,forestry,irrigation works and meteorology and 2.7 million in thetrade,food and service sectors.73In terms of political participation, women did not hold up even close to half thesky. In key political institutions,women accounted for well below half of themembers. The proportion of women in the National People's Congress increasedfrom 12 percent in 1954 t0 22 percent in 1975, while on the Congress's StandingCommittee women's representation rose from 5 percent to 25 percent in the sameperiod. Women made up 4.1 percent of the CCP's Central Committee in 1956and a marginally better 1o.2 percent in 1975. In the same year, around one-thirdof all members of the Communist Youth League were women.74 The state con-stitutions of 1954 and 1975 included the principal of “equality of men andwomen,”but no concrete quotas were set for women's participation.As theabove figures suggest, some progress was being made, and the level of participa-tion was comparatively good for this period. However, it was far from out-standing, and it was certainly well below what the party claimed to aspire to.The(almost entirely male)partyleadership consistentlysupported the trainingand recruitment of women,but there was never aconcerted effort to share powerequally.In part because of the failure to socialize care work in the cities,politicallife remained a particularly unfriendly arena for married women and those withchildren.

In the National People's Congress, minority repre-sentatives decreased from 14.5 percent of the total in 1954 to 9.4 percent in 1975.Even with this decline,minorities remained over-represented in the People'sCongress(thoughthey were slightlyunder-representedinthe CentralCommittee). This level of representation chimes with the CCP's efforts to manageminorities through a United Front strategy, which required that they be givena seat at the table even as the mostly Han central leadership retained overallauthority.The percentage of minority students enrolled in universities increased from1.3 percent in 195o-1951 to 6.4 percent in 1975-1976.Over the next twodecades, 7 percent appears to have been the ceiling for minority enrollment.76This number reflected almost exactly the minorities’ share of the total popula-tion. Given that most of those classified as ethnic minorities came from poor,predominantlyruralparts ofwesternChina,itseemsunlikelythatthiscould havebeen achieved without policies of affirmative action.

I would go so far as to argue that the beginning of theend of the Cold War came inEast Asia,not in Europe as has generally beensuggested. On the other hand, the conflict had a much clearer end in Europe,where socialism in the Eastern Bloc collapsed entirely after the fall of the BerlinWall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. In East Asia, the ColdWar arguably still continues on theKorean peninsula and across theTaiwanStrait.Despite these continuities between the Mao and post-Maoperiods,scholarshave typically found it difficult to escape the“1978 divide.”Historians,mostly inthe West, have spent more than a decade trying to overcome the enduring2 Wei Riping, “Zhidao sixiang shangde “liangjian': Shibada yilai Xi Jinping guanyu jianchi MaoZedong sixiang zhidao diwei de zhongyao sixiang shulie,”http://dangshi.people.com.cn/n/2o14/o814/c85037-25467371-2.html(accessed June 26,2017).3ElizabethPerryandSebastianHeilmann,“TheEmbracingUncertainty:GuerrillaPolicyStyle andAdaptive Governance in China,”in Elizabeth Perry and Sebastian Heilmann (eds.),Mao'sInvisibleHand:ThePoliticalFoundationsofAdaptiveGovernanceinChina(Cambridge,MA：Harvard University Asian Center,2o11),Pp.1I-15.4Shu GuangZhang,Economic ColdWar:America'sEmbargo against China and theSino-Soviet"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Alliance,1949-1963(Washington,DC:Woodrow Wilson Center Press,2oo1),pp.282-283.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Mao was both China's Lenin, founder of the state, and itsStalin,prosecutor of violent and destructive purges inside the party.The official 1981 verdict recognized Mao as a “great proletarian revolution-ary”and as the founder of the PRC,but added that hehad committed serious\"leftist mistakes,” for instance by promoting the Great Leap Forward.The Cultural Revolution was described as a“great disaster for the party andthe people,”although responsibility for the persecution ofinnocent people wasascribed to a “counterrevolutionary conspiracy\" by the Gang of Four in whichMaohimselfhadnoinvolvement.°TheresolutiondeclaredthatMaohadbeen5See:SusanneWeigelin-Schwiedrzik,“InSearchofaMasterNarrativefor 2oth-Century ChineseHistory,”The ChinaQuarterly,Vol.188(2oo6),Pp.1074-1075.6 “Guanyu jianguo yilai dang de ruogan lishi wenti de jueyi,” http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"64168/64563/65374/4526452.html, (accessed June 7, 2017); see also: Alexander C.

The party also re-evaluated severalmajor casesagainstcadresaccusedof“counterrevolution”duringtheSocialistEducation Campaign (1963-1967). The official press argued that efforts to correctthe wrongs of the Cultural Revolution would involve not only the revision ofindividual verdicts, but also a return to the policies of the “golden era” of the195os,when themajorstate andpartyinstitutionshadbeen established.TheCultural RevolutiononTrial:Maoand theGang of Four(Cambridge:CambridgeUniversityPress,2016),Pp.198-200.7Mao Zedong,“Zhongguo gongchandang zai minzu zhanzheng zhong de diwei,”in Mao ZedongXuanji,Vol.2,www.marxists.org/chinese/maozedong/marxist.org-chinese-mao-19381o14.htm(accessedJune 29,2o18).8 Zhang Shifei, Zhongguo dangdai shehuishi(1978-1992)(Changsha:Hunan renmin chubanshe,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2011),Vol.4,P.55.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

Only one of the five major categorizations (urban/rural, rank, class,gender and ethnicity）has been abolished.In the early 198os,the reformistleadership dismantled the system of class status, and with it the longstandingpolicy of “affirmative action”for workers and peasants.Beyond class,thepopulation is still divided between rural and non-rural residents by the hukousystem,resulting in differing entitlements toland,welfare and education.In state-owned industries and the party apparatus, distribution of goods andhousingbyrank ismorehierarchicalthanever.Forhigh-levelcadresandintellectuals,monetary salaries are only a part of a larger package of goodsand entitlements. Gender is still classified according to a male/female binary,withoutadditionaloptions.The ethnic classification system establishedin theMaoera,whichdividesChina between the Han and fifty-five minority nationalities, remains in placeand continues to reproduce itself as new generations are born into these cate-gories. The state has not recognized a new minority since the Jinuo of Yunnan wereadded tothelistin1979.Thegovernment stillregards ethnicity as something tobeidentified from above, leaving no space for identity politics from below. Thiscontrasts with the situation in Taiwan,where groups of “indigenous people\"(yuanzhumin),previously referred to as “high mountain tribes”(gaoshanzu）inMainland China, can petition for Taiwanese government recognition withoutwaiting for approval.

The move away from the persecution ofthe “four elements” was billed as a way to address the damage wrought by theCultural Revolution. Supporting the leadership's decision, the People's Dailyaccused the Gang of Four of causing mental and physical harm to second andeven third generation “four elements\"by promoting the “bloodline”theory.14It had of course been the Maoist left, including Jiang Qing, who had publiclycriticized the “bloodline” theory in 1966 (see Chapter 6), but politically the accusa-tionwasausefulone.In1984,thecentralgovernmentfinallydecidedtoallowalltheremaining“founelements”to“takeoffthehat.”Numbers areunclear,butoneChinesescholarestimatesthatover2omillionpeoplehadbeenclassifiedas“fourelements”since1949.15 Many were already dead,but those who were left were nowliberatedfrom thelabel.The news usually reached themvia a simple proforma document.Document 8.2, sent to Liu Sanyi,who was twenty-seven when he was classified asa rich peasant in 1949, is a typical example.

The government alsoapproved compensation for assets and apartments that had been seized duringthe Cultural Revolution. This expropriation had had wide-ranging effects: byI981,mostofthosewhohadoriginallybeenclassified as“bourgeoisbusiness-men\" were working as petty entrepreneurs, traders or handicraft workers.16The abolition of the “capitalist” label and the end to discrimination againstthe second generation were important steps towards restoring entrepreneurialactivityandtheaccumulationofprivatewealthinChina.Inthe198os,privateentrepreneurs were referred to not as “capitalists”but by the less emotive term\"individual households\"(getibu). Until 1988,they were permitted to hire only upto eight employees,while collective enterprises could hire as many laborers asthey required. This disparity led many private entrepreneurs to “put on the redhat”(dai hongmaozi),bribing officials to register their businesses as collectiveenterprises.Especially at the beginning of the Reform era,some marginalizedgroups-“four elements,”“sent-down youth\" and women“outside the system”-chose tobecome“individual households,”allowing them to earn money withouthavingtoseek admissiontoaworkunit.Wehave already seen that“intellectual\"was nevera separate class categoryinthe Mao era.

The regime recog-nized that, in order to foster the creation of a modern technocratic elite, it wouldbe necessary to re-establish meritocratic selection processes for higher education.In 1977, the leadership under Hua Guofeng had revived the national universityentrance examinations. Ten million participants sat the first examination, withonly 3 percent selected for admission.18 The national examination had beenabolished during theCulturalRevolutionin1966,and throughout theMaoerathe party had struggled with the tension between selection by academic perfor-mance and “affirmative action\" based on class and political considerations.After1977, family background disappeared as criterion in the centralized admissionsprocess.At thelower levels of the education system,examinations were reintro-duced to select students for elite “key-point” schools, which received extra statefunding. The new policies towards intellectuals and higher education signifi-cantly changed the social makeup of the party. In 1979,only 8 percent of newparty members were“intellectuals,”but in 1985 they made up 5o percent of theintake.19The final element of the new classification system was the introduction ofresidential identity cards in 1984.Despite the government's avowed obsessionwithclassification,nothing of thiskindhadbeen attempted intheMaoera.The regulation authorizing the creation of the cards limited the categories tobelisted to name, sex, ethnic status, place of residence and date of birth, a decisionwhich marked the end of the formal system of class status.²° The hukou,how-ever, remained in place as a separate form of registration.RedefiningPoliticalLabelsOne of the most important projects for the new party leadership was the redefini-tion of political labels that had been imposed during the Mao era campaigns.18JoelAndreas,RiseoftheRedEngineers:TheCulturalRevolutionandtheOriginsofChina'sNew Class (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press,2oo9),p. 224.19 Ibid., p.235.20“Guowuyuan,“Zhonghuarenmin gongheguojumin shenfenzheng shixing tiaoli',”inGuowuyuanbangongting fazhiju (ed.),Zhonghua renmin gongheguofagui huibian"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(January 1984-December 1984)(Beijing:Falii chubanshe,1986),Pp.84-87.Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core.

This was inpart a consequence of the failure of the Cultural Revolution,which allowed theDengist faction to win out over the Maoist left in the strugglefor control of theCCP.
