They initiated, in accordance with the guidelines of Central Document (1978) no. 78, a comprehensive review of cases containing charges against counter-revolutionaries and ordinary criminal cases that have been decided upon since the Great Cultural Revolution, correcting a large proportion of the unjust, false and mistaken cases. Altogether, in the decade from 1967 to 1976, People's Courts at all levels across the nation passed sentences in more than 287,000 counterrevolutionary cases. As of the end of July, more than 241,000 cases had been reviewed, accounting for about 83% of the total. Of these, more than 131,300 unjust, false, and mistaken cases were corrected, accounting for about 54% of the cases reviewed. Cases where sentences had been passed for opposing Lin Biao, the \"Gang of Four\" and complaints about the treatment of comrade Deng Xiaoping (abbreviated as the \"three types of cases\") have been reviewed and corrected. At the same time, more than 500,700 ordinary criminal cases were reviewed, and more than 35,800 cases of unjust, false and mistaken cases were corrected, accounting for 7% of the reviews. Furthermore, in the process of administering appeals, various People’s Courts also revised many unjust, false and mistaken cases preceding the “Great Cultural Revolution.” Practical experience proves that the review and revision of unjust, false and mistaken cases has remarkable results [and] is deeply popular both within the party and among the people. It serves an important purpose for maintaining the high prestige of the party and comrade Mao Zedong; for clearing away the damaging effects to judicial work caused by the radical leftist line of Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four;” for strengthening and developing a political situation characterized by stability, unity, vitality; and for mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses to carry out the Four Modernizations together.\nEven though the reviews have achieved great success, however, the tasks surrounding the reviews are still relatively demanding. At the end of July, across the nation there were still more than 46,000 counterrevolutionary cases and more than 500,000 ordinary criminal cases as yet un-reviewed. Among these cases of counterrevolutionary activity, there are many that are comparatively difficult, there are inconsistent opinions all over the place, and only through a large amount of investigative, political thought work and a systematic understanding can the matter be handled appropriately. The review work is progressing unevenly depending on the area. Some have already completed over 80% of the cases involving charges against counterrevolutionaries, including Beijing, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi etc., in total eighteen provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions. Shanghai, Xinjiang, Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan and Yunnan have yet to complete 80%. Tianjin and Tibet have yet to reach 60%. Qinghai and Zhejiang have yet to reach 50%. Ningxia has yet to reach 30%. Even in those provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions that are completing the review work at a comparatively high pace there are still some areas, counties and cities that are progressing at a slow pace. Moreover, the amount of appeals that concern sentences preceding the “Great Cultural Revolution” is increasing day by day. How to handle these appeals properly and determine which sentences were indeed mistaken and thus subject to revision is another arduous task for the People’s Courts.\nThe review and revision of unjust, false and mistaken cases is an extremely important task if the People’s Courts are to carry out the spirit of the Third Plenary Session. It is also an important preparatory task for the implementation of several laws next year. Whether to thoroughly carry out the reviews from start to finish, in accordance with the guidelines set out in the Central Committee (1978) Document no. 78, or to abandon halfway, this is a critical question facing People’s Courts on all levels. In order to ensure that the review work is carried out, it is our opinion that the correct ideological line must be kept, we must uphold the principle that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth, we must further liberate our thinking and integrate our understanding with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session and the Fifth National People’s Congress. In addition to these fundamentals, the following issues also require practical solutions:\n1. Erroneous tendencies such as refusal to liberate one’s thinking, insufficient implementation of policy, searching for weak points and leaving matters unresolved out of fear of revising what should be revised must be overcome. In March and April of this year, re-examinations in some areas have seen some backsliding. Some people, on the pretext of “safeguarding the flag,” have put the “four upholds” in opposition with the spirit of the Third Plenary Session, and in opposition with the review and revision of unjust, false, and mistaken cases. They say that the reviews have “gone too far” and were talking about “rightist tendencies” and “wind of reversing cases.” There are some cadres in the People’s Courts who, due to an incorrect ideological line, are unable to understand correctly the spirit of the Third Plenary Session; instead some new doubts are raised in their minds, they fear that in the future another struggle against rightists will come upon them. Therefore, they adopt a hesitant wait-and-see approach to the review work; they may even stop it altogether. There are even individual People’s Courts on the ground level that request that mistaken cases that have already been revised are changed back again. In addition, a small number of People’s Courts have adopted a relaxed attitude to the review work; they just want to go through the motions and complete the task in a casual manner. Because their thinking has not been liberated, some courts do not dare to adopt the principle of Seeking Truth from Facts or undertake the mandatory revision of all mistaken cases involving past sentences for charges of “betraying the country and defecting to the enemy” or “contacting enemy broadcasting stations,” cases connected to so called “vicious attacks” related to the party and the leadership, and cases where the person concerned has a bad class background or general historical issues. When the Supreme People’s Court examined cases where the original sentences had been maintained after a review by some local People’s Courts in Fujian, Shandong, Inner Mongolia and other provinces and autonomous regions, it was discovered that 20 to 30% of cases should have been revised but were not revised, in Linhe county in Inner Mongolia the number of such cases was as high as 50%. There are also cases that should not be revised but have been revised, this, however, is an isolated phenomenon that only exists in a small minority of places. \nConsidering the situation described above, our opinion is that among the following categories of cases, there must be a strict differentiation between the two kinds of contradictions, the line between what is a criminal offense and what is not must be clearly marked and the principle for handling the cases must be determined, and they must be [accordingly be] handled differently.\nIn cases involving a past sentence for charges of “betraying the country and defecting to the enemy,” there must be a differentiation between – on the one hand – those who were searching for means of subsistence, who crossed the border to be with their family and friends or who crossed the border illegally during a political movement because they came under attack or were implicated in a case for ordinary issues, or for no reason at all from – on the other hand – common criminal offenses such as those who crossed the border illegally to smuggle goods or drugs or for other profit seeking activities; it’s even more important to differentiate them from counterrevolutionary crimes such as crossing the border illegally in order to defect to or give aid to the enemy. The first case is an illegal act but – except if there are aggravating circumstances – does ordinarily not constitute a criminal offense. In the latter two cases, the offenses are to be handled in accordance with the law and with regards to the nature of the crime, the circumstances and the consequences. As for secretly boarding a foreign vehicle, boat or airplane or entering a foreign embassy or consulate without permission, these cases can be handled in different ways according to the principles mentioned above.\nAs for cases involving a past sentence for charges of “contacting enemy broadcasting stations,” there must be a differentiation between those who were deceived by the enemy stations’ agitation, who wanted money or goods, or who were trying to secure some means of subsistence, etc., and therefore wrote letters to the enemy agents’ broadcasting station containing ordinary social intelligence, or containing some mistaken views or even accusations, but who definitely have not engaged in any counterrevolutionary activity [on the one hand], from those who have made contact with enemy agents with counterrevolution as their goal in order to engage in counterrevolutionary activities [on the other]. In the former case, the matter should mainly be resolved with criticism and education; the people involved are not to be punished as counterrevolutionaries.\nAll past cases involving charges for so-called “vicious attacks,” influenced by the “Six-Point Directive on Public Security,” must be revised in accordance with the principle of Seeking Truth from Facts, as long as the purpose was not counterrevolutionary. After the smashing of the “Gang of Four,” due to a lack of understanding of the correct measures enacted by the Party Center, some places have repeatedly sentenced people who have said or written things praising Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” who have made improper remarks damaging the party and the leadership or have committed some other wrongdoing, using the so-called charge of “vicious attacks.” This type of case is also to be handled in accordance with the principles described above. Henceforth, words and deeds similar to those above, as well as any expression of incorrect viewpoints in relation to ideology and theory, cannot be punished as counterrevolutionary; it is only crimes that have a counterrevolutionary purpose, that propagate and agitate for overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat or the socialist system, that can, in accordance with the stipulations of the criminal law, be punished as counter-revolutionary propaganda or incitement; the charge of “vicious attacks” is not to be used again.\nAs for appeals concerning cases where the sentence was decided on before the Great Cultural Revolution, they should be handled in adherence to the policies and laws of the time, in line with the spirit of Seeking Truth from Facts and the guiding principle of “counterrevolutionaries must be eliminated wherever found, mistakes must be corrected whenever discovered.” If it can be affirmed that the original sentence was inconsistent with the facts, or there was confusion between the enemy and us when determining the nature of the offense, or if a sentence that should not have been passed was passed, or if the sentence was abnormally harsh and is still being served, [the case] must be carefully analyzed, and redress granted based on the particular circumstances of the case. As for those cases where the original sentence is consistent with the facts, where the resolution of the case was basically correct, or where the sentence was abnormally harsh but has already been served, there is ordinarily no need to alter it. If the original sentence was correct and the appellant is unreasonable, he or she must be criticized and educated and the request for appeal should be rejected.\n2. After the revision of an unjust, false or mistaken case, a suitable solution must be found with regards to the follow-up work. This is an important step determining the successful completion of the review work. Without this, the party policy cannot be completely implemented, the vile consequences caused by the radical leftist line of Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four” cannot be erased and the sympathy of society cannot be obtained. Everywhere, a general tendency is reflected, that after the revision of the an unjust, false or mistaken case, there are still many difficulties related to solving issues like the persons work situation, wages, hukou, housing situation, living subsidy and so on; many among those concerned are living under insecure conditions. They say: “When we were considered to be guilty there was food to eat, when we are considered to be innocent there is no food.” Some request to go back to the camp for reform through labor to find work, some even commit an offense on purpose, wishing to be imprisoned again thus solving the food issue. In eight areas (municipalities) of Hunan province there were 133 people of this kind who could not be provided a suitable position. As a consequence, there are some courts that do not dare to announce the changing of a sentence in cases where the person is innocent and the sentence should be changed and as a result the person is still kept in the camp for reform through labor. In the city of Shanghai there are over 200 people in this kind of situation. The fact that follow-up work has failed to provide an appropriate solution for them, and that it was not possible to fully implement the party policy, has caused dissatisfaction with the party and the government among some of the people concerned and their families. They constantly bring their complaints from place to place, roaming all over the place, adding to the instability of society.\nIn order to resolve the issue of the unjust, false and mistaken cases follow-up work, it is our opinion that when it comes to people who have had their original sentence revoked, their innocence declared and who according to policy and law are not to be held criminally responsible, those who originally had work can, in addition to having their political reputation restored, be appointed to a suitable position by their original unit, except for the cases where the work in the original unit needs to be approved by the local government. Ordinarily, a suitable position should be prepared by the original unit in discussion with the relevant department in the area where the person in question is currently residing; but those who are currently in the countryside (including small towns) should in principle not be returned to large or mid-sized cities. Concerning economic issues, they should be handled in line with central and local guidelines. Those who did not originally have any work should, following their return to their original area of domicile, be provided with suitable work by the local government; those who live under difficult circumstances should be given financial aid in consideration of their circumstances. These people and their families should not be discriminated against politically. However, the solution to these issues involves the Organization Department, Ministry of Personnel, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Civil Affairs and other departments, and cannot be solved by the courts themselves; they must be solved comprehensively, under the unified leadership of the party committee. We advise all provincial, municipal and autonomous regional party committees, in line with the spirit of the relevant central policies integrated with the actual local circumstances, to consult the suggestions described above and work out a concrete method for resolving the follow-up work issues, supervise and push through its implementation by the People’s Courts and the relevant departments.\n3. In order to guarantee the quality of the case reviews, we advise all local party committees to carry out even closer inspections of local People’s Courts’ review work. The objectives of the inspection are: (1) to determine whether or not the totality of the cases involving sentences against counterrevolutionaries since the Great Cultural Revolution have been reviewed, and whether or not, among these, the “three categories of cases” have all been revised; (2) to determine if the cases involving rehabilitation and revision have all been investigated and examined, if there has been a meeting with the person concerned, if the handling has been conducted in conformity with policy and law; (3) to determine whether the rehabilitation and revision of cases was conducted in accordance with relevant legal procedures and if the court records are in order; (4) to determine whether the follow-up work has been carried out. Through inspection, one can confirm the achievements and find out what is lacking, as well as discover issues and find prompt solutions. Particular attention must be paid to solving issues involving cases that should have been revised but have not been revised, where there has been a search for weak points and matters have been left unresolved, as well as cases where the implementation of the follow-up work has failed. Every People’s Court must follow the guidelines formulated in Central Document (1978) no. 78 on how to conclude the review work. In the small number of places where the task is difficult and the progression is slow, one should report to the party committee which will increase the review capability, adopt effective measures and work hard to ensure the completion of this mission within the first half of next year. It is imperative that the quality is guaranteed, and that the task is carried out well from start to finish, it cannot be treated as a formality or performed in a haphazard manner.\nUpon conclusion of the review work, the People’s Courts of all levels must organize the cadres for an earnest analysis of the cause to the unjust, false and mistaken cases, summarize their experiences and what they have learned, eradicate the pernicious influence of the radical Leftist line of Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” so as to improve judicial work in the future, improve the quality of case handling procedures, make a due contribution to the strengthening of the socialist democracy and legal system and protect the smooth progression of the Four Modernizations.\nIf the report above is found to be appropriate, please refer it to the provincial, municipal, autonomous regional party committees so that they can supervise and press the People’s Courts and relevant departments to thoroughly implement the policy. \nSupreme People’s Court Party Group"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"December 17, 1979"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by the Maoist Legacy Project team"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
