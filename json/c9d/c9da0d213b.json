Some would leaveearly. come late.  Others wouldn'tC pay very close attention to the instrumentsthey were supposed to check, so quality fell, and this led to a waste of materials.This was for regular production work.There were other kinds of workers, likerepair and maintenance workers, who would just take their time in repairing things,they would use 2 hours when l hour was all that was necessary, and then wouldn'tfix things very well. Generally people slowed down and didn't pay that closeattention to what they were doing."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This repair work was very important, because the machinery alwaysneeded some sort of repairs and often there were production halts or slowdownsbecause of these.

A saying for this iss \"if you lose insidethe system, makee up for it outside the system\"(tinei sunshi, tiwai bu).}Inhomes people did not have much furniture, and they could use the glass to maketables and desk tops.It was very useful."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"They also had fire-resistant glasswhich was very useful for cookingaroundthehome."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In 1977 they finally set up a system of punishment linked to bonuses.They would dock individual workers' and groups as a whole for missing materials.They had a regular system of inspectinn by the security department.Before,they couldn't do anything to the workers.They couldn't dock wages, couldn'tfire, coulan't demote.They just did education with those who were caught,but there was no regular system of inspection to catch them."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Althoughh the stealing problem improved, the problem of low work efficiencydid not get much better up until the time she left.Basically people justdid not meet their quotas, and there was no punishment for this in wages orotherwise.Rhythms of work--at the beginning of the year, things were prettyrelaxed, and work was not arranged very carefully.At times management wouldrun a production campaign, and cadres would come down to the shops and doideological and mobilizational work.When this occurred workers worked harder.They were not willing to be lax at work when cadres were right there.But whenthe cadres were not there to watch, things got more relaxed.?Thesemovementscame especially frequently near the end of the year."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Generally speaking, older workers worked harder than younger workers,who didn't have much motivation."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One of the reasons is that these older workersmake 70-80, while younger workers doing virtually the same work would getabout half of that.They felt the difference in pay was too large, and unfair.Shop Floor Organization"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Shewasagangweigongren, which means that she had a fixed productionpost on the shop floor.
