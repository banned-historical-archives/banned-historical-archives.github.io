He worked in the metal casting shop at first, then in the parts processingworkshop as a fitter. Did this until 1980, when he became an accountant (hesuan) inthe shop office,calculating costs of production, etc.Wages"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He started as an apprentice in 1972. First year apprentices got 16 yuan, then 1820 up to third year.Then became grade 1 worker at 36 yuan.RHereached thislevel in1973, because he got credit for the two years he was sent down.There still were nobonuses then, not until 1979. After one year at grade one,you were raised to grade 2,at 40yuan.The next readjustment was in 1979.They did it according to a percentageearlyon.The state said you couldIpromoteacertainpercentageonegrade,and theygave out quotas to each shop andgroup. They would assess workers and others andgive the raises to the backbones, section heads and those who took on responsibility.About 20% as he remembers in the beginning.They met and discussed but in the endthe cadres of the shop decided."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After the 1979 readjustment, they gave raises to all except for criminals and longterm absence.This was because for a long time there had been no raises.They did itaccording to need: seniority, wage level, family burdens. In 1984 I was finally raised tograde 4, at 61 yuan. Also got another raise in 1987 to 72 yuan, grade 5 level. This wasmy qiye ji, or qiye gongzi.There was also a floating portion of the salary that was 6yuan a month, so I got a total of 78 yuan. If you were absent more than 12 days amonth, they could take the floating wage away. This floating portion was decided foreachpersonby the factory. It could change, and they could give different amounts todifferentpeople.They can't change the basic wage,but they can change the flatingportion,and even take it away temporarily.The shop director makes the decision andthe factory approves. But it doesn't usually change."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some places have the pinren zhi, where each shop has the ability to get rid ofpeople,and they become bianwai gongren.Then you lose your floating wages, bonuses,and so forth.But we don't have it and so there is no good way to solve the problems ofworkers arguing with supervisors, or poor work attitude.Wedon'tcarrythisoutmainlybecause the managers are so worried about funds, sales, and so forth, theyhaven'thadtime to carry it out.But they also have to think about whether this reform will workwell in our factory. Not necessarily so.The workers don't worry too much about thissystem, they just want to work and make money. With this system though, workerscould be punished,so they probably would not like it. But workers don't activelyparticipateein politics, read newspapers, and think about policies that are coming up, anddiscuss them andanalyze them.They don't have opinions about things until theyhappen. Few workers sit down and think things through for themselves. They justwork and go home.

In shops,the party organization is mainly responsible for giving reportson important meetings,documents from the center,and give reports"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the shop the branch secretary is supposed to help the director finish theproduction responsibilities. For example, if the workers are unhappy and are slowingdown, they go down and find out what the problem is, discuss things with workers.

If thereis a problem in production, go the the director; if its thought, attitude, livelihoodproblems, go the the secretary, unless you happen to know one a little better than theother.The shop director should ideally be someone who knows production and takesinitiative.The secretaries should know some theories, principles,understand people'sthinking. But in ereality all the time if the two don't get along they transfer director Ato be party secretary of B, and vice-versa.In reality,the differences aren't that great,they're all just leaders.

No one has the powerto just make decisions themselves.Have to discuss and try to agree.In our factory,thedirector is 30+, secretary 50+,and there's a contradiction there.
