In almost 7oo pages, they chronicle with magis-terial insight events behind this vast political and social upheaval.Usinga range of materials, including publications of that decade and memoirsand other records published since,MacFarquhar and Schoenhals offerforensic analysis of the factional politics at the highest levels that pro-pelled the majority of Chinese to be caught up in Mao's last great gesture.Most of the narrative focuses on the very top of Chinese politics, on theleadership compound in Zhongnanhai, beside the Forbidden City in theheartofBeijing."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"AREVOLUTIONINCULTURE2Missing from this important study is the cultural dimension of theCultural Revolution.

Studies in Chinese and Western languages ofopera,literature, art, and music have offered considerable insight intothese particular activities between 1966and 1976,although most frequently in the broader context of post-1949 or twentieth-century devel-opments. The usual approach is to regard these ten years as a period oflimited and distorted activity.Many Chinese,when asked about culturein these years, will suggest only half facetiously that there was no culture.The old joke:Eight-hundred million people watching eight shows'(Bayiren kan ba ge xi) is frequently cited as adequately summing up culture dur-ing this decade.The followingpages,drawingupon contemporary mate-rials,recollections,andscholarly studiesproducedinthethirtyyearssinceMao's death, and taking an approach that attempts to respect the profes-sionalismandskills ofmanyofthe artists involved,willtry toshowhowmisleading that old joke is.The madness of Maoistpolitics can explainthe stupidity and emptinessofmuch ofculturalpracticein theseyears.Wewillseehowpolitical leadersconstantlyworried about theircontrol ofcultural production and consumption.But there wasmore going on,withmore lasting impacts,than a concentration on the political dimension canbegintograsp.An approach that brings together a wide range of cultural practices,from opera and dance to writing,reading, fine arts, and even architec-ture, shows the interconnectedness of cultural production and consump-tion in these years.

The Nationalist (Guomindang) regime that hadbrought a degree of national unity after 1928 was revealed as weak andcorruptduringtthe years of the Pacific War. Meanwhile the Commu-nistParty in itswartime headquarters inYan'an was able to experimentwith new ways ofmobilizing rural populations for nationalistresistancetoinvasion and for the transformation ofsocialpower inthe coun-tryside and towns.Leninist ideas on mobilization were combined withChinese notions (whether imagined or real) of collectivist cooperation.Mao Zedong and party ideologues produced writings laying down policyfor thereturn to the cities.Thesepolicies includedrecasting traditionalideas about the social func-tions of literature and art to enlighten,uplift,and unite popular under-standing of the world.In thisfield,as in others,imported concepts werecombined with local traditions to produce a new hybrid to serve China’s(and the Communist Party's) own purposes. Westernized writers andartistsfrom suchplaces asBeijing andShanghaiwere obliged to exploreways to use popular or folk cultural traditions for new,revolutionarypurposes. Such policies were put into effect, first in Yan’an and the Com-munist base areas, then across the nation after 1949.The delineation oferas accordinggtokey events(for example,the 1911fall of the Qing dynasty, the 1937 Japanese invasion of China proper,and the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949) has been thenorm in thinking and writing about China in the twentieth century.Acultural perspective,however,calls into question the importance of thesedates.The kinds of changes in literary style typical of the May FourthwriterspublishinginNewYouth after 191shad origins in thenew-stylenovels onmodern subjects that emerged in the189osand before thefall of the dynasty.More important for art and literature in mid-centurywas not the Japanese occupation of much of China but the enunciationof policies on cultural practice by Mao in Yan'an in the spring of 1942.BonnieMcDougallandKamLouie,intheircomprehensive1997overviewof Chinese writing in the twentieth century, outline a more useful peri-odization that acknowledges deeper changes than simply the political.They suggest three major periods: 19oo-1937 Towards a New Culture',I938-196sReturn toTradition',and 1966-1989‘TheReassertion ofModernity'6As the titles of each period indicate, the 1949 political divideshrinks from significance and Mao's efforts to connect with popular and"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"AREVOLUTIONINCULTUREelite Chinese traditions take cenitre stage.Xiaobing Tang,writing in 2ooo,offers a similar backward glance at the preceding century,identifying thecoherence and totality ofitsliterature and art.An unprecedented stepinnotusing the standard ten-yearperiodizationof the Cultural Revolution appeared in 2oo5 in a 6oo-page chronologyof dance in China since 1949.

Cultural activities,including the publication of literary journals,new feature films, and a broadening of performing and literary genres,sawamarkedexpansion.The following pages will show how in the realms of cultural produc-tion and consumption the activities in the ten years after 1966 drew uponefforts since evenbeforeYan'an days tocombineWesternand Chinesetraditions and elements in new culturalpractice.Itisno coincidence thattheeight so-called modelperformancesof theCultural Revolutionconsisted ofmodernizedmusical theatrewithdeeprootsin Chinesepopularculture,twoballets which reworkedaWestern classicalgenre,anda symphonic music piece based on one of the modern-style operas.

When they wereseen,a natural conservatism seems to have ruled out much popularity.When the Chinese Communist Party established its national regimeafter 1949,these efforts at reform of old opera tales continued, on alarger and centralized scale.Likefilm,reformed opera was seen ashaving a great part to play in themodernization ofpopular culture and thedissemination of new, approved ideas. On 2 October 1949, one day afterthe proclamation of thePeople's Republic,theNational OperaReformCommittee (Zhonghua quanguo xiqu gaige weiyuanhui) was established.4Through this and subsequent bodies, opera personnel were subject topolitical training, the troupes were re-organized and, those approved,puton a sounder financial footing,and harmful plays were banned.The trial performance convention(xiqu guanmo yanchu dahui) becamea standard device to promote and regularize opera modernization.TheCulturalRevolution‘model operas’were also tested and refined atsuchgatherings.Actors,musicians,writers,and managers from opera troupeswould gather togetherto watch trialperformances,hear statementsofoffi-cial policy, and exchange opinions on the works seen.At the first of theseconventionsin1952,onlyeightoutofeighty-twoperformanceshadbeenon contemporary subject matter. Clearly,the re-working of traditionalopera presented major problems.Audiences had a longhistory of operaappreciation with which tocompare the new-style plays.Artists had gener-ations of conventions in all aspects ofperformancewhich mightormightnot be changed in the name of reform.6 Both performers and audienceschafed asreform-minded leaders and writers,such as the musicologist andcomposerYu Huiyong,took up the challenge ofopera modernization.The Great Leap Forward in 19s8 was Mao Zedong's way of jumpingover theexpectedstagesofindustrial developmenttoachieveinternationalI.MODERNIZINGCHINESEOPERA"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I3levelsofprosperity andmodernization through human effort on a massivescale.

Criticism offilms and of history plays allegedly showed what was wrong with culturalpolicy and with what audiences had been watching. In a sense,modern-ized opera could show audiences what wasright.The attention given thesummer 1964 convention in Beijing sent a message to all parties involved.The kind ofritualperformancewhen national leadersparaded onto astage and sat at covered tables listening to or giving speeches could sendpowerful signals,even if we ignore what the speeches said.The perfor-manceitselfwassufficient.Themomentum wasclearly in themodern operas’favor.An indicationof this came in an unprecedented ‘message to readers’ from the editors ofXiju bao,the pre-eminent theatre journal published by the China TheatreArtists Association.The two-page statement at the very end of the October1964 issuewasanexampleoftheself-criticismthatwasstandardpracticein Communist China as aconfession ofsins andpromiseofimprovement.The foremost area in which mistakes had been made,the editors noted,was in their lack of support and coverage of modern-subject opera, towhich they had held an indifferent, nitpicking atitude.29Work at creating,refining,and performing new modern operas andother drama continued apace in 1965, inspired by the success of thesummer 1964 convention in Beijing.During 1965 six major regions heldeight conventions for trial performances of new stage works.30 The persis-tent regionalism is noteworthy. The East China modern opera conventionin early 1965 included Shaoxing opera (Yueju), Shandong opera (Liju),Wuxi opera (Xiju),Huangmeixi from Anhui province, and thirteen otherkinds of local opera, but not a single Peking opera.31 Opera companiestried,aspolitical and other conditions allowed,to create performancesthat would appeal to their actual and potential local audiences.Pekingopera may have been the ‘national opera form, but it was a status enjoyedby default,deriving from the nation's capital being in Beijing.Given achoice, audiences appear to have continued to prefer their own,local ver-sions ofmusical drama.The subject matter,stories,and characters on thestage may have been novel in these new-fangled operas, but at least thelanguage and much of the music were nicely familiar.

It formed another thread in the lead up to the start of theCultural Revolution.Thismovementserved several,somewhat disparatepurposes for both the recipients of the ‘socialist education' and for the supposed providers.

A wholerange of the best and brightest in China's opera and theatrical worldscontinued to work on the operas until they were fixed on celluloid in theearlyI97os.The five ‘model operas’ identified in 1967 as yangbanxi were TheRed Lantern(Hongdeng ji),Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy(ZhiquWeihushan),Shajiabang,Raid on the White-TigerRegiment (Qixi Bai-hutuan), and On the Docks (Haigang). The first three were all set inthe two decadesbefore1949.Raid on theWhite-TigerRegiment had aKoreanWar setting. Only On the Dockswas a contemporary story.Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy was one of two model operas withthe longest pedigree.At the heart of the opera was one of the most widelyrecognized and enduring heroes in modern Chinese drama, Yang Zirong.Yang had first appeared in a novel by Qu Bo published in 1958. Tracks inthe Snowy Forest (Linhai xue yuan) proved a major publishing success,running rapidly into several printings totalling in the millions.

The workwas the first in the programme. In August national leaders watched theopera at their annual summer retreat at the seaside resort of Beidaihe andexpressed their endorsement. Many in the top Party leadership, includ-ing Mao, were big traditional opera fans. Tours to Shanghai, Nanjing,Jinan, Guangzhou, and elsewhere occupied 1965, during which the pop-ular appeal of theoperawas confirmed.The songs and musical accompaniment were a majorpoint of attention.After learning of the death of Aunt Cui (Choi in Korean), the central hero,YanWeicai,expressed his emotions in an aria that carefully built upona complex series of traditional meters.As Tiger Mountain had incorpo-rated somebarsfromTheEastIsRed,the startofWhite-Tiger includedthetunefromsocialistanthemtheInternationaletounderscoretheinter-nationalist theme.In similar vein thehighly familiar‘Battlesong of thePeople'sVolunteerArmy'echoed through thescoreasacentral themetune, a device more usual in a modern musical than in a Peking opera.

Such rectification had been a commonParty technique to correct unwelcome attitudes and work styles sinceYan'an days.As then, study of the writings of Mao Zedong was report-edly the catalyst to changing perceptions.

Wang even suggests that news reports from 1965about the writers of the(future) model operas studyingMao's theoretical1937work On Contradiction(Maodun lun) offer a clue to the realityof their work at the time. These professionals were grappling, like theirpredecessors throughout the twentieth century, with the‘contradictionbetween continuing the musical tradition and innovating (gexin) beyondit.The work on the music of the model operas in effect was part ofaccumulating a new tradition (jilei xin chuantong).

Otherarts, such as fiction,poetry, and painting, were also expected, at variouspoints in these years,to reflect the application of this theory.In its firstpublished form, the theory stated as follows:Among all the characters,give prominence to the positive characters;among the positive characters,give prominence to the main heroic characters; and among the heroes giveprominence to the central character.108Yu Huiyong, composer of the music for Shajiabang and Tiger Moun-tain, who had recently been appointed preparatory head of the ShanghaiCity Culture System Revolutionary Committee,first expressed this formulationina 23May1968article.The threeprominenceswereslightlyreworked ayear and a half later,in thekinds of adjustments to wordingtowhichpolitically activeChinese of the timeneeded topaycloseattention to avoid blottingtheir theoretical copybooks.TheNovember1969 issue of Red Flag, the Communist Party’s main theoretical organ,rephrased thelastprominenceasemphasizing the‘mainheroiccharacter(zhuyaoyingxiong renwu).TheRed Flag articlewas about the creationof theheroesinTakingTigerMountain byStrategy.No artwassafefromthis theory,however improbable its application:‘not only dramas,buttelevision,novels,even those arts that do not necessarily include people,such as poetry and painting, all use the three prominences.109This all-embracing theory did not spring from the head of Yu Huiyongin 1968.As we have seen, reports on the creation of the model operas in thethree years before the start of the Cultural Revolution generally mentiontheefforts of the directors and actorstogetrightthepositiongiven theheroes.

Heroes inevitably occupied centre stage,were well lit,and were deferred to by the grouping of his or her allies.By1974 it was acknowledged that the proper use of the theory required abalanced approach.The bad characters in operas and other arts should notbe sointeresting and theheroes so bland andpredictable that audienceswouldnaturallypprefertorootfor theformer.1i2Approaches borrowedfrom spoken drama wereput to usein the ser-vice of the new-styleoperas.There were,as Jiang Qing pointed out tothe modern-subject Peking opera convention in Beijing in the summer of1964,onlyaboutninety spoken-dramacompaniesin thenation,butmorethan3,oooopera troupes.113From spoken drama came therelative dis-tillation or concentration of elements,includingplot and its shaping,andcharacterization thatwere often weaker in traditional opera.The use of skilled stage directors was a new factor in the art of the modeloperas.Theposition of director is associated with the establishment ofthe central opera academies and theatre school in Beijing in the earlyI95os. As in other areas of Chinese life, Soviet experts were invited toadvise Chinese specialists on ways to train a new corps of stageperformersand other specialists.Chinese opera was less directlyaffectedby theseimported advisers than,say,spoken drama,modern musicals,dance,andfilm.But the theatre artswerea broadchurch,and China’s cultural leaderswere keen to see Chinese opera also adopt modern,and,of course,moremanageable,ways ofoperating.The directors came from spoken dramaand from film.Their production design,including blocking the actorsin ways that were previously unknown on the traditional musical stage,brought an initial freshness to the operas.Opera had always been anactor's art.Professional directors took an audience's point ofviewandworried about rhythm, what needed to be exaggerated for effect, andhow each sequence and scenewould contribute to the overall effect onaudiences.Using professional directors,often from other stage arts,encouragedactors to step beyond traditional role types and conventions of perfor-mance. Actors were urged, in the long process of the reworking thesefirst model operas, to take risks. The vocabulary of movements availableto lead and supporting actors was expanded. Yang Zirong's horse rid-ing at the start of Tiger Mountain is said to have been a combinationof traditional stage practice and Mongolian dance movements. Similarly,the dance movements of Yang's men,including when they ski across the4.THEARTOFTHEMODELOPERAS"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"49snowy plateau,combined real-life actions with operatic and folk-dancetraditions for an overall effect thatwasboth novel and almost familiar toaudiences.114Some movement was taken directly from traditional operas.Audiences had always enjoyed sequences in which characters fight supposedly in the dark, unable to see each other. This was transferred to ascene in Shajiabang where the New Fourth Army men fight against anenemy they cannotsee.115Actors adapted to theconditions of themodernsubjects.FangHaizhen,the Party secretary in On the Docks,wore a short red scarf draped aroundher shoulders. She occasionally wiped her brow when she performed phys-ical labour or was under pressure. The kind of stage business that theactress portraying Fang could do with the scarf was the modern equiv.alent of the actions much loved of actors, and of audiences, once donewith handkerchiefs and sleeves. Li Yuhe in The Red Lantern had his longred scarf to fling back across a shoulder or hold out in his hands to punc-tuate a point in an aria. Soldier characters like Yang Zirong and GuoJianguang could resort to pistols,horsewhips, and other props in similarechoofolderdevices.The three prominences rubric, however, could hinder the creation ofa desired stage effect. Having to reserve centre stage as much as pos-sible for the central heroes worked againstmore creative directing andinevitably encouraged exaggeration of theseheroes.Audiences reportedlygrumbled about the concentration on these monumental characters andthe plots that became horribly familiar. Popular sayings put the mock-ing summaries of the operas into rhyming couplets but the gist can beexpressed in English: ^Company commander makes a mistake, Party sec-retary points out the correctpath;thebad egg is revealed,theplay's over'In a similar vein, the prominence given to female heroes was ridiculed: °abig girl, wearing red clothing, stands at the highest place, and points outthedirection we should go'.116Even costuming and stage design in the model operas built on conven-tional opera expectations rather than rejecting the past.The costumes ofPeople's Liberation Army soldiers may have looked like the real-life uni-forms, but the designers took great pains to acknowledge theatrical needs,modifying through simplification and exaggeration.The seventeen-year-old Li Tiemei presented on stage a crystallized notion of what a poorpeasant girlin the 193oslooked like.Sister Aqing,in her apron and withfrog-fastened crossoverneckline,similarlywas a distillation of signsfromreal life and from the theatre.

Scripts were the key: As peoplesaid:Scripts,scripts,it's all in the scripts.Writers were few and lacked lifeexperience.Training a new corps of talent would take time,butin threeor five years, results could be achieved.

Revisions ensured prominence (she usedthe verb tuchu) for Yang Zirong and his comrade-in-arms,ShaoJianbo.As an encouragement to participants at the 1964 convention,JiangQing's speech on the surface looks reasonable and affirming.That wascertainly the view of the editorial writers of Red Flag in the followingpages of the June 1967 issue.They first quoted Mao Zedong in a recentlyreleased letter he had written in 1944 to an opera troupe in Yan’an urg-ing critical use of tradition and the reform of old-style operas.The nextparagraph started with reference to Jiang Qing's 1964 speech. Thus, herremarks were put on a par with Mao's.They even referred to it as her‘talks’(jianghua),echoingthe titleofMaoZedong's 1942Yan'anTalks.However, there is no mention of any role Jiang Qingmay have had in thecreation,revision,or promulgation of the five model operas.This acclaim and massive publicity for the model operas (and othermodel performances) in 1967 suggested a triumphant progress for theprocess of Peking opera modernization.

Transplanting, the Sichuan experience showed,was a kind of‘re-creation’(zai chuangzao).The themes,personalities of the characters,and plot lines of the model operas couldnot be freely changed, but the transplanting could fully bring into playthespecialities of thelocal opera form.Use of theuniquecharacteristicsof Sichuan percussion and the relatively high-pitched singing style (gao-qiang)rendered Tiger Mountain in Sichuan-opera style.At issue was aproper balance between innovation and continuation, issues not unfamil-iar to the creators of the original model Peking operas.By 1974 a range of new operas had appeared on China’s stages. Theyincluded the Peking opera set among the Miao people of Guizhou Tem-pest on Miao Ridge(Miaoling fenglei),the Shanxi opera (Jinju) Climb-ing Peach Peak Three Times(San shang Taofeng),the small-scale Hunanopera (Xiangju) Song of the Teachers (Yuanding zhi ge),the short Shaox-ing opera from Zhejiang province Half a Basket of Peanuts (Ban lanhuasheng),the short Huai operas from Shanghai Old but Still Red (Renlao hong xin)and Collecting Coal Cinders (Jian meizha),the Peking operafromInner Mongolia Sons and Daughters of the Grassland (Caoyuan erni),and the short Hebei clapper opera (bangzi) The Ferry Crossing(Du-kou).50 Innovations were possible in the process of creating these newworks.Tempest on Miao Ridge, for example, included folk-style songs(‘mountain songs’ shan’ge) in its score.S1 Several of these works had ori-gins before the Cultural Revolution. The call for new works modelled onthe model Peking operas allowed some old scripts to be dusted off andadjusted to fit the new rubrics.Audiences were undoubtedly relieved atthe greater number ofworks available for watching,though not by therepetitive emphasis onheroes andcorrect thinking thatcharacterized allthese stories.Ferry Crossing, a children’s story about an old ferry man andhis young daughter foiling class enemies, had had its premiere in 1973.Before long,more than 1oo opera companies were busy transplanting itfrom Hebei clapper opera into local stage forms.$2 Being a short workmay have been part of the attraction to other localities’operaworkers:80"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"SPREADINGTHENEWMODELSThey could complete an adaptation more quickly and thus indicate theircommitmentto thetransplantingproject.Having appeared to offer some relief to Chinese audiences, severalof these works had extended,multi-form lives.Sons and Daughters ofthe Grassland,for example,had started in 1964 as Heroic Little Sis-ters of the Grassland(Caoyuan yingxiong xiao jiemei),a work by thePeking opera company of the Inner Mongolia Art Theatre,presented atthe national convention on modern-subject Peking operas.In that sameyear, an animated version of the story came from the Shanghai Anima-tionFilmStudio.3In thesummerof1972,thestoryhad been turned intoanother Peking opera by the samecompany,LittleSisters of the Grassland(Caoyuan xiao jiemei).ByApril 1973,the story was inballetform asSonsandDaughtersof theGrassland.S4HalfaBasketofPeanutshad its originsin aWu operafromJiangxi insouth-central China.Ithadbeen adapted asearly asDecember197ofromthegrippinglytitledone-actspokenplayFlowersofPhilosophyBloomEverywherein theMountainVillage(Shancunkaibianzhexuehua).Theallegorical potential of a half-basket of peanuts must have been obvious,as in June 1971,the propaganda and cultural authorities of neighbouringZhejiang set up aZhejiang provincial Half a Basket of Peanuts writ-ing group’ to create a Shaoxing opera.

In mid-1976 a spoken dramabased on the model opera Azalea Mountain appeared on Shanghai'sstages.The work of the Shanghai Spoken Drama Company,it was thoughtit could help spur a revolution in spoken drama like that inPeking opera.As we have seen,plays without songs came relatively late to China andnever really took hold. The adapted play seems also to have been ameans to rehabilitate the spoken drama troupe in Shanghai.The reviewsof the spoken drama version of Azalea Mountain rather pointedly suggest its potential in promoting the Sinicization of the genre, noting ithad a ‘national style and national air (minzu fengge be minzu qipai).67The actors reportedly rejected the Stanislavskian approach that had beenadopted from the Soviet Union by many actors in the 195os, insteadapproaching their roles from a ‘proletarian stance'Despite these claims, scepticism is warranted. Chinese theorists andcritics had been using these phrases about‘national style’for more thantwentyyears.IfAzaleaMountainhad achievedthissowell on Chinasspoken-drama stages, it is surprising that few other attempts were madeto transplant the model operas into spoken form.Here again the supposedperfection of the model operas worked against their use in other genres.The inflated expectations invested in the operas could not possibly bematched on a spoken-drama stageor in otherperforming forms.In effectthe model-opera model was too good to work.The model operas could model other genres as well. Poetry writing wasan area in which mass participation could be relatively cheaply encour-aged. The model operas, so familiar to all Chinese by the mid-197os,provided inspiration and examples of how to write lyric poetry in particular.In the mid-197os, one local effort at a new poetry-writing campaignwas at the Xiaojinzhuang Brigade near Tianjin,which had earlier distinguished itself in learning to sing the arias from the model operas.A bookof Xiaojinzhuang Brigade poems was published in early 1975 in whichthe peasant poets had been inspired by the model works’presentation oftheir central heroes.68 One reviewer of the book found examples of oper-atic style‘frozen poses’(liangxiang) in some poems.Many of the ariasthemselves were fine poetry and could serve directly as models for lyricalcompositions.86"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"SPREADINGTHENEWMODELSAs in the mass poetry campaign in 1958's Great Leap Forward, partof the motivation in promoting this kind of amateur composition was aneffort to undermine theinfluence ofestablished,professional writers.Bythe early 197os, some specialist writers had returned to their profession,though in closely watched circumstances.The cult of the amateur,illus-trated in a small way by theXiaojinzhuang poetry campaign,was intendedby the cultural leadership as a means to limit a sense of therestorationof the professional.Ironically, the means of promoting this relied on theconsummate andvastrange ofprofessionalism thathad beenmobilizedin thecreation of themodelperformances.Painting could also learn from the model performances.Thepeasantpaintings of Hu County in Shaanxi province near Xi'an enjoyed consider-able vogue in the period 1973-1976. One of the most widely reproducedHu County paintings lacked theprimitivist aura of most such work butallegedly drew itsinspiration from the artist's study of the model performances. It was by Liu Zhide, the Party secretary of the Qinsan Produc-tion Brigade of the Qindu commune in Hu County,who was described asan amateur painter. In his painting, titled The Old Party Secretary (Laoshuji), the greying man sits in a field beside his hoe and hat, lighting hispipe but deep in concentration on a political booklet in his lap.Liu Zhideattributed thesuccessofhispaintingtofollowingthemodel-operacreativeprinciple of‘sourcing from life,higher than life(yuan yu shenghuogao yu shenghuo).69 This held that the model operas (and works inspiredby them) should springfrom real lifebut at the same time be a heightenedversionofreality.Liu Zhide described theprocess by which heproduced The OldPartySecretary.It was a process of realizing the need to give full prominenceto the heroicold man,along thelines of themodel-opera concentra-tion on the central hero.Hisoriginal concept of the figure in thepainting was insufficiently ambitious and not treated as a model or representative (dianxing).He had drawn him from life but not gone beyondreal life.Through trial and error and a summarizing of the aim of thepainting, a more typical character emerged. The painting was repro-duced far and wide in 1974, perhaps because of the apparent ordinar-iness of the old man,in contrast to the tiger-skinned waistcoats of amodel performance hero like Yang Zirong. The images of the two men,however,shared similar theoretical roots,ifwe are tobelieveLiu Zhide'saccount.Even the writing of popular songs could be modelled on the experience of creating the model performances.

By the early 197os, these histories hadbeen suppressed. Records of the experimentation and false starts,published to a limited extent before the start of the Cultural Revolution,werenolonger available to ordinary Chinese.Librarieswere difficulttoaccess and all had closed-stack and even closed-catalogue policies. Thevariousstoriesof thecreation ofthemodel operashadbeenhomogenizedinto astandardized account of thetwo-line struggle'betweengoodnessand evil (given a Marxist class and theoretical gloss).When artists liketheLiaoning songwriters noted their indebtedness to‘the creative experi-ence’ of the models, they meant the creative example of these works. Theso-called theoretical concepts that the model operas exemplified were toinform all culturalproduction.Publishing was another means of spreading the model functions of the‘model performances'. Stills from the film versionsin particular werepublished on important holidays in newspapers and magazines nationwide.Using stillsfrom thefilm versions ensured a standardized and,increasingly,familiar set of iconic images.

In theSeptember 1969 issue of Red Flag, the pseudonymous writer Zhe Pingwrote of threats to their status as models for the new culture.Under thetitleStudytheModelPerformances,Defend theModel Performances',thearticle suggested that twokinds of evil persons were actively undermin-ing the models. One group included people who had been expelled fromopera troupes when these had been recently purged (qingxi).

The Party should energetically popularize the ex-perience of Xiaojinzhuang, a village-sized production brigade in theprovince.Xiaojinzhuangwas closely associated with Jiang Qing and theother Cultural Revolution radicals who later were identified as the Gangof Four.116 While ostensibly signalling a broadening of cultural activity,theHebei gatheringrepresented further defensive efforts to resist a risingtide of popular and political resentment at Cultural Revolution strictures.Hebei wasperhaps too close toBeijing to allowmuch space for realexperimentation in the cultural field.Xinjiang was about as far fromthe capital, geographically and culturally, as was possible in China.

This caused the disbanding of the writing groups by thespringof1972,despite the Culture GroupinBeijing in late1971 and early1972 telegraphing its plans for feature-film production.Moreover,nowthat thePearl River studio,like the other film studios across the nation,wasunder thelocal control oftheprovincialrevolutionarycommittee,the script department's plans to seek scripts from beyond Guangdongprovince were stopped. Only after a meeting at New Year's 1973 withJiang Qing (referred to in the document as ‘the Central senior officer',Zhongyang shouzhang) did the studioleadershippush ahead with findingnew scripts and securingpermission to send teams tofiveprovinces toseek new works.The small size and lack of skilled personnel in the scriptdepartment meant finding new amateur writers offered some solution.The studio leadership apparently found difficult the transition in theirthinking from producing newsreels and documentaries to making new-style features.1i0At the Beijing Film Studio the first of the new films was The Scout(Zhenchabing),directed by Li Wenhua.Li had been the cinematographeron themuch-criticized Early Spring inFebruary and had also served inthe same capacity on the balletfilm of The Red Detachment ofWomen.Li was also given sole writing credit on the script, an unusual move at atime of ‘collective writing group'credits.

There was criticism,when director Lin Nong showed some early rushes at the studio,thatthe hero,the‘number one’character（yihao renwu),was not shown tobe sufficiently ‘tall, large and perfect’(gao, da, quan, or high, wide ardhandsome’),as the current slogan described such figures.Director Linsnorted back:Tall and large, tall and large.

They are amulti-ethnic crew:Han,Tibetan,and Chinese Muslim(Huizu).One summer night they hide in wait to see why logs have been floating away fromthemill and succeed in exposing a gang of thieves.This was a less pleasur-able work, in terms of the attractions of minority films. The combinationof three ethnicities,played by Han actors apparently cast for their looks,whose voices were dubbed by others,did not give a satisfyingly ethnicflavour for Chinese audiences.134The Cultural Revolution authoritiesclaimed that thesenew featurefilms represented a repudiation of the bourgeois, Hollywood-inspired5.GROWING THEINDUSTRY,PLEASINGAUDIENCES"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I45styles of those made in the seventeen years before the Cultural Revolu-tion.But the continuities are striking.The same influential directors wereactivefrom the 194os through to the 198os.The same actors appeared onChina’s screens before and after 1966.And the same audiences continuedtogrumble.Mao Zedong inhis 1942Yan'an Talks,which was thebasisfor policy in literature and art from 1949 on, had eschewed naturalism:Literature and art can and ought to be on a higher plane,more intense,moreconcentrated,moretypical,nearer theideal,and thereforemoreuniversal than everyday life.13s The slogan promulgated after 1958 aboutcombining revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism'wassimilarly anti-naturalistic, though it allowed for a greater acknowledge.ment of national Chinese aesthetic'modes,from opera and elsewhere.The model films of the Cultural Revolution continued this aestheticthrust but to a particular level of excess.One illustration is Youth(Qingchun),a widescreen colour feature made at the Shanghai studioby Xie Jin.

The interest shown by officials in the Shanghai cul-tural apparatus, reportedly including detailed critiques of early versionsof the ballet, indicates the important symbolism attached to making ahomegrown Chineseballet.14The new work drew upon five dance,ormovement,traditions:West-ern ballet, traditional Chinese dance, Chinese folk dance, martial arts,andmovementfrom Chinesemusical drama.Thetraditional language ofballet could beseenwhenXi'er andWangDachun dance apas dedeuxor when Xier dances alone, on points in the mountains.But when, forexample,WangDachun is sent off to join the Eighth Route Army,thechoreographers draw on Chinese martial arts movements.In the masseddances,for example,at the end of the drama to signify theunity ofpeas-ants and soldiers,folk traditions ofgroup dancing areprominent.Tomake the characters andnarrativeclearer and toensure that Chineseaudiences, who were generally unused to watching ballet,understood andliked what they saw, singing in solos and a chorus was introduced intothe dance-drama. Chinese folk traditions, at village festivals, for exam-ple, had always included simultaneous singing and dancing. The originalopera made this relatively easy: Several songs and tunes from the Yan'anopera were preserved in the ballet, while several new songs and musicwere written for the dance version.Music from the Anti-Japanese Warera,including the song of thePeople's Liberation Army,added anote ofhistorical context to the story.A sense of authenticplace was enhancedby incorporation of the plaintive style of Northern Shaanxi folk songsand the tunes of Hebei and Shanxi clapper opera (bangzi).

Mostmajor sections of the People's Liberation Army had professional songand dance troupes attached to them, mainly charged with entertainingthe forces but also encouraged to practice outreach into the civilian com-munity.The armyhad been required to restore order in many Chinesecities in 1969, as rivalry between Red Guard and other factions eitherturned more violent or stalemated necessary decisions and economic pro-duction.Marshall LinBiao,the topmilitaryleader andMao's chosensuccessor,inSeptember 1971had diedwhile allegedlyplotting tokill Mao.The People's Liberation Army had some work to do in shoring up publicaffection and respect.Entertainment with new dances that emphasizedclose army-civilian relations was one way to do this.

The Cultural Revolution insurgents regarded the latteras an attempt to deny the inherent class nature of all art and literature.Nonetheless, as the grip of the insurgents over cultural activities was loos-ened in the early 197os and as their influence weakened,more variety ofmusical expression emerged.Meanwhile another aspect ofmusical cul-ture in these years,the effort at creating suitably rousing songs that wouldappeal to mass audiences,was sustained at theprofessional and amateurlevels.In all these musical phenomena,the position of folk or indigenous music in relation to modern music remained a central challenge tocomposers, performers, and indeed to audiences or users of the music.59Like other performing arts and cultural activities, music making hadbeenre-organizeddupon theestablishmentof thePeople'sRepublicin1949.To existing conservatories inBeijingandShanghai were addednewschools in places like Xi'an, closer geographically to the Chinese heart-land.A central conservatory,the China MusicAcademy,was set up onlyin 1964, on the eve of the Cultural Revolution.60 Two somewhat contra-dictory focuses characterized musical endeavours-in the new apparatus.Onewas the teachingandperformance of modern,Western music and theon-going creative work to sinicize this music, to express Chinese experience in the international language of modern, classical music.The secondfocus of musical culture after 1949 was more inwardly directed, on themusical traditions that had emerged in China over centuries and across2.SCORINGTHEREVOLUTION:MUSIC"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I77regional and ethnic diversity.This in effect was an effort to modernizeChinese music, both folk and traditional (if this distinction can be prop-erly made). As with old-style opera, part of this focus was the censoringof tunes, lyrics, and styles considered salacious, vulgar, or bourgeois′.61Notwithstanding the careful,ethno-musical research ofmany dedicatedscholars, one result of this work was a tendency to homogenize and oblit-eratedifferencesin treatmentoffolkmusic.A similar tendencywasseenindance,anotherfolk activity thatwaselevated toreceive attentionfrommodern-trained specialists.Westernmusiccontinued toholdpowerful sway.Thiswasinspiteoftheofficial effort to put Chinese traditional and folk music on an equal foot-ingwithWestern music,at least structurally though not necessarily in theminds of musicians and other music professionals.A Central Symphony(Zhongyang yinyuetuan) was established in 1956 and a Central NationalMusic Orchestra (Zhongyang minzu yinyuetuan) in 196o.62 Chinese com-posers continued to produce Western-style music,not infrequently basedon folk tunes in themanner ofnineteenth-centurynationalistEuropeancomposers. But the stalwarts of the Western canon: Beethoven, Mozart,Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and company continued to hold pride of place intherepertoire.Ironically, despite the efforts to promote folk-based music, the Cul-tural Revolution in music saw a considerable emphasisplaced on Chi-nese reworking of Western classical music.Even the music of the mod-ern Peking operas was strongly influenced by Western music.The more‘tuneful’and regularized soundsof themodel-opera scores owedmuchto the creative borrowing of instruments,harmonics and effects, drawingupon at least half a century ofmusical experimentation in Chinese musi-cal theatre.Given theresolutelymodernsubjectmatterof thenew-styleoperas,the incorporation of sounds and musical effects that were identi-fiably modern was hardly surprising.

But in these years, the piano was declared a‘revolutionaryinstrument'. This was in line with the Maoist thrust, seen in the Great LeapForward in 1958 but having roots in Yan'an, that foreign and Westerntechnologies should be put to Chinese purposes. The piano joined modernartillery,theblastfurnace,and modern military organization in a centuryofuseful borrowingmade to serve China’s questforwealth andpower.Prominent in this effort to use the piano to popularize the music of themodernized operas was the Central Symphony's Yin Chengzong, himselfan award-winning pianist and twenty-five years old at the start of the Cul-tural Revolution.Hehad studied attheLeningrad Conservatorybetween196o and 1963.86 In the late 196os, after Chairman Mao had met morethanonemillionRed Guards assembledincentral Beijingonseveralocca-sions,Yin came up with the idea ofperformingrevolutionary songs onhis piano in Tiananmen Square.87 His dream of a massed concert in thesacred heart ofthe capital provingimpossible,Yin threwhimself insteadintotransplanting thenew-stylemusicofthemodeloperasintoworksforthe piano.In this way,his instrument could be sinicized and put downreal roots in China.Thepiano-accompanied version of The Red Lantern,with Yin at thekeyboard,wasfilmed by the Central Newsreel andDocu-mentaryFilmStudio in 1972.88 The same feature had two other sections:thepiano Yellow River Concerto,with Yin as soloist,and several ariaswith symphonicorchestral accompanimentfromShajiabangPiano adaptations became a major new musical genre in the later periodof the Cultural Revolution.Theseincludedreworkingofclassical Chinesemusicwith theforeign instrument.Thepiano version of the well-knownMoonlight on Second Spring (Er quan ying yue) by Chu Wanghua wasoneof the better known of such adaptations.This work had first beencomposed in the 193os by a blind itinerant erhu player named A Bing(1893-195o).89 A similar classical number reworked for the piano wasFlute and Drum at Sunset (Xiyang xiaogu).This piece,but for lute (pipa),2.SCORING THEREVOLUTION:MUSIC"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I85had first been transcribed in 187s, although it had been performed sincethe eighteenth century.

Those feudal and bourgeois things cannot serve the Chi-nese revolution.Butwe cannot use a nihilist attitude:we should use criticaleyes to assimilate(xishou) those things.Several secondary themes also show up in the visual culture, includingfine arts,of the Cultural Revolution.The influence of the model performances, both the heroes of the works and the approach to art exemplifiedby their creation,can be seen in this field.The paradoxical success of themodel operas and ballets that ensured their ultimate failure as efforts atmodernity alsoplagued somekey artworks from theseyears.The emphasis on the amateur was another theme that thevisual arts shared with othercultural activities,as the specialist professional came under criticism.Thebroadening of the repertoire apparent in the performing arts,includingfilm in the early 197os, can also be traced in fine arts and architecture.As in literature and in the performing arts, on a smaller scale, as well asin painting and other visual arts,underground or unofficial experimen-tation helped lay the groundwork for apparently considerable changes inthefollowingdecadeIn these ten years, the most common artistic images available in Chinafeatured one man, Mao Zedong.

This historical episodewas a contentious one,for the now-deposed head of state Liu Shaoqihad also visited the striking miners. Visually placing Mao in the mineworkers’history was a way of ‘correcting’ the alleged falsity of Liu'ssupport to the strikers. The painting was given widespread distributionin 1968,including being incorporated into Mao badges and a portraitbust.166"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4.VISUALIZINGTHE MODERN:FINEARTSAND ARCHITECTURE 2O5Liu Chunhua’s painting was among those widely reproduced in a rangeof media.These included woven silk versions of the standard Mao por-trait, itself standardized further with great care at the highest levels ofstate in theseyears.The silkportraits eventually included reproductionsof news photographs:Mao after his 1966 swim in the Yangzi River,Maoand Zhu DewelcomingZhouEnlai back to China atBeijing airport,Maoplaying table tennis.As this latter suggests, some of the silk tapestrieswere highly domesticated, even intimate portraits of the highest leader.167These representations of the chairman contrasted with the standard, usu-ally oil paint, versions, which increasingly showed him towering overthe landscape, in a more god-like position than Liu Chunhua's Anyuanicon.168Large statues of Mao Zedong began to be erected at the start of theCultural Revolution.The first of these were set up at Tsinghua University,an insurgent centre in Beijing, on 4 May 1967, as a sign of loyalty tothe chairman. Concern was expressed soon after at the highest levels ofgovernment that such statues be of appropriate quality, but by the early197os,most large state offices,universities,and some other major publicbuildings were graced with giant statues of Mao in front of them.169 Hewas oftenportrayed withhisright arm outstretched ingreeting orbene-diction.The overcoat that in general clad the figure allowed the sculptorsscope with drapery ofmore interest than a simply giantpair of trousers.As with religious iconography, including China’s long history of Buddhistsculpture, these statues were presented to tell stories. The one outsidethe Shaoshan railway station in Mao's home village in Hunan,for exam-ple,was raised on a plinth so that its height could make reference toMao's birthday.170 These ubiquitous statues graced Chinese cities at thesame time as red billboards at key intersections carried quotations fromthe chairman orkeypolitical slogans in large white characters,andmajorbuildings in many provincial centres and Beijing raisedllargerooftopLonglive Chairman Mao'(Mao zhuxi wansui) signs in neon lights.One suite of statues, given considerable attention in the late 196os and197os, had first been created in mid-196s. This was The Rent CollectionCourtyard’(Shouzuyuan),a 118-meter-long setof114human figures setup in a former landlord’s house in Dayi County, Sichuan. Made for class-education purposes to narrate a story of oppression and resistance, thestatues were a locationpiece designed for the specificcircumstances of themansion.Peasants ofall ages are shown beingexploited,humiliated,andphysically abused by the landlord, his family, concubines, and officers.The peasants hand in their meagre harvest as rent and taxes.Resistanceis not a strong element:There are only clenched fists and noble chests206"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"ELABORATINGCULTUREgazing into a (presumably liberated) future.There is no representation ofpeasant or underground Communist organization. The group of statueswas the work of teachers and students at theSichuan Academy ofFineArts in Chengdu.While theindividual statues were in the socialistrealist,public-hero mould, the idea of a whole suite of statues in one place nar-rating a story was a new concept.Sichuan citizens were organized to visitthe statues, meet with the local peasants, and hear their tearful, some-what mechanical recollections of the ‘old society'.171 Photographs andadocumentaryfilmtookTheRentCollectionCourtyardtoaudiencesacross China.In October 1966,forexample,Tianjin cinemaswere showing the documentary as part of National Day commemorations.Copiesof theoriginalexhibitioninDayi countywerecreated and setupforclasseducation purposes in Beijing and other cities across China.172 A similarclay sculptural ensemble, modelled on the Sichuan original but telling thestory of serf resistance in Tibet, had been created by late 1975.173As was the case with the model operas, a good idea by specialists beforethe Cultural Revolution tended to lose its impact through dogged repetition. The style of the statues, however, was copied widely by othersculptors,though with a greater emphasis onpolitical actionand revolution.The centre of Shenyang city,capital of Liaoning in the northeast,for example, was graced after 197o by a massive statue of Mao Zedongwith arm upraised, supported by a gigantic prow-shaped set of statues ofworkers, peasants, and soldiers thrusting forward.174 At the same time, amore romantic,softerkind of statuary,often situated in public parks oratimportantnatural sitesin a longChinese traditionofmarking thelandscape with stone calligraphy or carving,was no longer possible, exceptproducedprivatelyChinese painters since at least themid-nineteenth century had beenresponding toWestern artin a range of ways.Traditional landscapepaint-ing,done withink andwatercolours,had developedindifferentdirectionsfrom Western art.To Chinese eyes,Western painting was in oils,seemedalien,and was associated with the modern.Many Chinese painters feltchallenged by this other tradition and sought to counter it by elaborat-ing new ways with landscapes, ink, and watercolour.

In addition, with the riseofrevolution and the triumph of the CommunistParty,landscapepaint-ing was obliged to confront another challenge, the politicization of landscape representation.

Students and some staff, particularly younger, less-establishedteachers,formed Red Guard groupsin 1966-1968,producingagitpropart for use in newspapers and broadsheets, as well as more consideredworks.175 Much of this painting was in oil, as a modern, internationalmedium.The old, Chinese landscape-painting heritage was undervaluedand even denounced in these years.Historical portraits,done in a some-what romantic modernized Chinese style in watercolour,were the specialty of Cheng Shifa.His obvious error, in the eyes of Red Guard criticsin mid-1967, was to have painted several portraits of the Ming dynastyofficial Hai Rui. Cheng suffered the same sort of attack as had Wu Hanfor his historical drama about Hai Rui.176The poster or propaganda painting of the Cultural Revolution tookconsiderable inspiration from the operas and ballets of the‘model per-formances'.Fine art thus joined film,music,and dance in modelling thecharacters and styles of theyangbanxi.Actual portraits ofYang ZirongLi Tiemei and others,in action or as stationary ttableau,were renderedinto oil paintings and widely disseminated.

Amateur artists, inspired by reallife among ordinary people,were an alternative vision to the academy.Theyrepresentedd a supposed empowering of the ‘broad masses’ and areleasing ofnatural creative talents,in deliberate contrast to the elitismand alienation seen as inherent in trained professionals.The peasant artistswere not alone in being made use of in this on-going tension betweenthe ‘red”(hong: politically correct) and‘expert’(zhuan: professionallycompetent).179But this celebration of peasant painting was not an unblemished ornaive throwback to valorizing folk ways.Rather than a rejection of themodern, the Hu county painters and their works can best be understoodasofferinga Chineseroute tomodernityinart.Drawingon thecustomaryrepetition ofpatterns,seen in more everyday folk art such aspaper-cutsandpaintedpapier-macheorsewn and stuffed animal toys,thepainterscreated large-scaleworks that wentwell beyond folk artin their ambitionand aesthetics.

In its simplicity and relative brevity, Song of the Teach-ers was hard to distinguish from similar short works filmed in 1965-1966as part of the pre-Cultural Revolution promotion of new-style operas oncontemporarysubjects.The Hunan opera had first appeared in 1972, when, in best CulturalRevolution practice, it was credited to a collective of amateur and pro-fessional writers in Changsha.Liu Zhongfu served to record the script,whichwaspublished in an earlyissueofXiangjiangLiteratureandArtthe newly restored Hunan provincial cultural magazine.61 It was hailedas a fresh new work and noticed nationally.From July 1973 Song ofthe Teachers was at the eye of a storm of debate in literary circles, forthe cultural insurgents had seized upon the work as a symbol of prob-lems in literature and art and as a weapon to use against their factionalrivals.62 By mid-1974 Song of the Teachers came under sustained denun-ciation,first locally and thennationally,a reaction probably prompted by3.MODELASSERTIONS:CRITICIZINGWORKS"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"233the distribution of the recently completed flm version.63 This pattern ofstarting with small, local criticism and then broadening to a nationwidecampaign was also a standard Cultural Revolution practice.

The young girl student's grandfather used to own a factorywhich is a small gesture towards acknowledging class interests.
