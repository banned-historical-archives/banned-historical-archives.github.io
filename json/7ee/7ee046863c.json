He wasthen assigned totheEoal Transport Team of theCanton MunicipalTransportation Company (yunshu gongsi). During the first two years hewas a transport worker, and received apprentice wages. In l977 he wastransfered to work in the coal transport team's personnel department.He was a 'diaodong yuan', which meant that he was in the office and was atthe disposal of the leaders in his unit to run to the company offices to getsignatures on papers, to do errands, to help straighten out problems at sites.They didn't do much work normally， because there just wasn't much to do.Usually they played cards, chess, read books, listened to the radio.Itwas an easy job, and he hadn't worked at manual labor for 2 years, beforehe asked his friend toihelp him leave China.His friend's father was thehead of another company in town.So he asked his friend if he could possiblyhelp. HHis friend asked his father, who asked the personnel department peopleto dinner, etc.， and it was finally arranged. This kind of thing waspretty common--'human relationships'((renqing)， or a form of going throughthebackdoor(zouhoumen)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"This kind of practice influenced everything, including raises, bonuses,promotions.There is always a provision for 'ideological thinking', 'attitude',etc.， for these kinds of considerations to slip in.There are two sayingsfor this in China: \"human relationships are bigger than certificates\" (renqingdayu zhengming), and \"one home village is worth three chops\"(yige laoxiangdengyu sange tuzhang). He says these sayings very accurate."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He did this kind of work for about 2 years, then came to Hong Konglegally in l979.Wages"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"when he first started, he was an apprentice and got 2o¥, during thesecond year it was 34.5¥, because he became a grade 1 worker. Some lines ofwork have 3 year apprenticeships, his only had one.  In l977, he was raisedto grade 2， 44¥.Part of the reason for being raised so quickly wasguanxi, his friend's father. Also, he had worked just long enough to qualify,and hadn't gotten into any trouble, showed up for work regularly.HHe hadthesewageswhenheleft.Bonuses"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There were no bonuses when he started working. After the Gang of 4,they had them.  At the beginning, they had bonuses of 7,5, and 3¥. Butthey cancelled them shortly thereafeter, because they were too large.They have instituted in transport sections a bonus for groups which overful-filltheir transport tonnage.Thenwithinthegroupstheywillassesseachworker according to work contribution, attendance at political study, thought,etc., and then split into three grades. Every time they assessed for bonuses,there would be at least one or 2 workers who would begin to argue. Thiswas natural.Work Discipline and Punishments"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"No one was every fired in his team , for any reason, during his fouryears there.  But they did have punishments (chufen). They would mentionsomeone's name at a large meeting, and proceed to criticize him.They couldlower wages a bit。 TThe units just didn't have the power to fire people orto take away their wages. PBut if someone got into political trouble or ifthey were sent away to labor reform, this was equivalent to being fired."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"-1-They had pecple who received this kind of punishment.It was fairly commonto be punished for trying to sneak off to Hong Kong, for illicit sexualrelations, and for stealing goods.But the latter was not too prevalent--who would want to steal coal??These weren't always things you could getfired for, but it was possible.  Then a mark goes down on your file, andit is difficult to find a good job later--you become somebody who is notwelcomed."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Workactivism:workers would listen to orders all right, but theywould take their time following them, and would not take the initiative todo things unless theyY received a direct order. For example, in his unit,there were goods that had to be kept out of the rain.But workers wouldnot voluntarily begin to move things out of the rain unless you came andorderedthemto.TheCoalTransportTeam"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"His team under the transportation company was responsible for movingall wood and coal in Canton City.There were about 240 people working inthe team. There were no real fixed internal divisions of labor--workassignments were arranged each day on a very flexible basis, and you didn'tknow what your assignment would be until you got to work."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He describes the leadership of the team as not really having muchpower.  If they had any important matter or decision to approve, they had tojust send it up to the higher levels. Their hands were tied, and they had togo through a series of approvals before things can go through. Much Ci hiswork in the office was of this nature--processing signatures-- so he isvery aware of the complex of approvals necessary for ordering materials,getting repairs, etc."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The top leader was the team leader (duizhang), and there were also2 assistant  team leaders. These leaders were appointed from the companylevel, but were all from among the workers in the team.(Otherwise, theworkers would not listen to them.When they made work assignments eachmorning, each group of workers would have one of them appointed a 'temporarygroup leader', but they had no real power."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"These team leaders were all party members.They gave assignments toworkers directly.?There were no other cadres.They do all the leadershipwork.The paperwork, calculations, etc., all go on at the company level,where there was also a revolutionary committee.  At the company level, wherehe also worked, they had about 2oo plus staff, equal to the size of a team.They were divided into departments like a factory headquarters is. Therewas no branch party committee in the team, but in the company.Theteam'sparty leadership was in a party small group (dang lingdao xiaozu), thatoversaw production,and all the team leaders were members.Factionalism"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There were of course problems left over from before the CR, some left-over factionalism. Not out in the open, but hidden.People would not bevery friendly to one another, or would basically ignore one another andjust handle their jobs.1For example, one leader struggles another, butafter a few years the old cadre comes back and has an even higher office.They don't get along well, and sometimes will do lots of small hidden thingsto get back at one another."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There is another kind of factionalism.  People who just look out for theirown interests and ignore those of everyone else. This is very common."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"-2-Political Movements"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The biggest one during his four years was right before he left:\"grasp firmly rehabilitation work\", and \"seriously punish those who havecommitted crimes\". They punished two types of people. Those who hadcommitted crimes during the CR.  Those who were counter-revolutionary--dissatisfied with socialism.  This meant talking with foreigmers, sayingbad things about China.  You would then be given a counter-revolutionarylabel. Otherwise, they pulled out the files on all the people in theunit, to see whether or not their cases had been disposed of properly."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"一3一"}],"authors":["Andrew G.
