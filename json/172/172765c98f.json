In theorizing on the historical experiences of our country's socialist practice, the article deviated from the Marxist path, openly blaming and opposing all socialist restructuring carried out by our Party during the 1950s. The article labels our country's socialist restructuring as \"turning back the wheel of history\"; it slanderously calls our Party's guiding thought \"parochial experience theory and historical idealism\"; reprimanding a \"clique\" within our Party for \"opposing science, opposing democracy, opposing progress, using Marxism on its signboard, placing agricultural socialism at its nucleus, and whose ideas can be concentrated to feudalism\". On the basis of its stance on our Party's character and our country's system of socialist modernization, it is quite obvious that the article is opposed to the Four Cardinal Principles."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The appearance of this article was not unexpected. Over the past period of time, a line of thinking has emerged, contending that China must pass through a phase of capitalism or national capitalism in order to realize socialism, or that we must now return to the era of New Democratic China. This is not the product of two people's convictions, but rather a current theoretical trend of thought existing among a group of comrades. If we do not increase our refutation of this kind of erroneous concept, not only will our accurate learning of history from experience suffer, but it will only draw the misgivings and dissatisfaction of the people toward the current Party line and policy, generating a slackness of heart and disintegration of fighting spirit."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"We must take careful note of those theoretical concepts currently appearing in resistance to the Four Cardinal Principles, also carrying out suitable refutations, displaying neither ambiguity nor hesitation. However, we must adopt a careful attitude in carrying out this struggle. Generally, the problems of these comrades are still ones of thought and awareness, compelling us to adopt a \"Unity-Criticism-Unity\" approach in correcting the internal contradictions among the people, implementing mature policy, gently and mildly grasping facts, discussing morals, convincing people by reasoning. Encourage them to make self-criticisms, without exerting overdue pressure. When carrying out open criticism in newspapers of concepts opposing the Four Cardinal Principles, pay attentiuon to writing style and proper restraint, not giving people the impression that there have already surfaced divisions in our Party over our Party's current line, or that we intend to \"strike down in one blow\" comrades contending erroneous concepts."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Academic journals and other periodicals are openly published and distributed, some even being sold outside the country, lending them far-reaching influence. Take utmost care in publishing articles; editorial offices at periodicals must manage affairs from an attitude of taking responsibility for the Party and people. If prudent care is not taken in publishing some articles with obviously erroneous political content, they can easily be used by reactionary periodicals abroad, creating misconceptions among some academics studying Chinese affairs, mistakenly believing that our Party is in the kind of state described in the article, or believing that this is the general opinion of Chinese academics. All of this will have unfortunate political consequences. All Party committees dealing with periodicals must strengthen their leadership, making sure that all important articles pass their eyes. They must manage affairs in strict accordance with Central Document (1981) 7. All theoretical problems dealing with the Party line, direction or policy, or of important political nature, must lie in unison with Party decisons and statements when externally disseminated, walking in step with the Party, not acting in one's own way. No periodical may give a propaganda platform to those erroneous concepts opposing the Four Cardinal Principles. Problems in appraising Comrade Mao Zedong or Mao Zedong Thought must be still more sternly treated, not allowing light-hearted commentary. Some local Party committees have recently strengthened leadership of periodicals, intending to check and inspect articles previously carried in periodicals, concertedly drawing lessons from experience--this is an advisable method."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 20, May 6)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
