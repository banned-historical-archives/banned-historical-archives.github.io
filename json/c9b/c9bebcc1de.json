duringthereprisalsthatfollowed than in 1959 [the 1959 uprising].\"9The Chinese sideinitially considered thisan“armedcounterrevolutionary revolt”(ch.wuzhuang fangeming panluan) paralleling the 1959uprising.For example,ina park called Martyr'sPark,which was builtto commemorate those who died in Nyemo,the event is referred to asoneofthe“TwoNine Revolts”(ch.liang jiupanluan)—thatis,the tworebellions with the number nine in their dates, 1959 and 1969.10 How-ever,within the Chinese Communist Party(CCP),this designation wasinternallydisputedfromthestart,someformerrevolutionaryleaders ar-guing that this was not about Tibetans opposing Chinese, as was the casein 1959,but was merely the two revolutionary factions engaged in seri-ous conflict.11 Given this dissent, the Chinese government reinvestigatedthis issue several times,rehabilitatingmany ofthosewhowereinitiallyincarceratedandpoliticallylabeledasstateenemies,andthenfinallyin1987itwasdowngradedfromacounterrevolutionaryrevolttoonlyacounterrevolutionarykillingevent/incident(ch.sharenshijian).12IntheWest and among Tibetan exiles, however, the nun continues to be val-orizedasaheroicfemalefreedomfighterwhofoughtbravelytodefendTibet and drive out the Chinese.13Academic analysis of theNyemo incident has been cursory,discus-sions consisting of,at most,a fewpages in chapters,articles,and books.This circumstanceis,of course,understandable given theheretofore al-mostcomplete absence ofprimary and secondarydata,but ithas cre-ated the curious situation wherein thefact of the occurrence of a majorrevoltof sortsinNyemois well known,but thecause of theeventis atbestnotwellknownandatworstmisunderstood.Oneofthemostwidelycited academicaccountscomesfromWarrenSmith'smonograph,TibetanNation.Smith'sbrief discussion oftheNyemoincident states that it was a nationalist conflict arising as a result of theCommunistParty's attack on all aspects ofTibetan culture during theCultural Revolution.Smith contends,that as the Cultural Revolution pro-gressed, Tibet's two revolutionary mass organizations polarized alongethnic lines, the Gyenlo faction (ch.zaofan) becoming predominately Ti-betanand theNyamdrefaction(ch.dalianzhi)becomingmostlyChineseAs a result, the factional conflict in Tibet,he says, “took on a national-istic content previously absent.\"14 Consequently, despite mentioning otherfactors (such as food shortages, grain requisitions, the introduction ofcommunes,and the onset offactionalstrife),by asserting thattherevo-lutionaryfactions were ethnicallybased,Smithis able toconclude thatIntroduction"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"5theNyemo incidentwas essentially an expression of Tibetan anger atChinese oppression—a popular uprising of the oppressed minority eth-nicTibetans againsttheir majorityHan tormentors.Smith,thereforeagrees with those who have labeled the events in Nyemo as the“SecondTibetan Revolt,” the first being 1959.15A recent article by Robert Barnett on Tibetan women in politics alsobriefly mentions the nun, arguing that she led a movement to contest theChinesestate:From the Chinese point of view, the most dangerous revolt in Tibet since1959,and the most recent major incident preceding the 1987 protests,was the Nyemo uprising of 1969,which had been led by thefamousnun Trinley Chodron.As a charismatic rural leader, she had been able tomobilize a large number of armed male followers,who had swept acrossnorthernTibetbeforebeingthemselveswipedoutandexecuted.NyemoAni, as she was known,was not a political activist in the modern,rational-istsense:shewasconsideredbyherfollowerstohavebeenpossessedbya powerful deity,a minister of the legendary Tibetan hero King Gesar.Shethereforerecalled amucholdertradition of threatsposedtothe statebymillenarian and similar religious movements,familiar to the Chinese fromthe Taiping rebellion.16A third well-known scholar of modernTibet,TseringShakya,has alsodiscussed theNyemodisturbances:In1969 there was widespread rebellion throughout Tibet,eventuallycrushedbythePLA.Thebest-documentedepisodeistherevoltledbyTrinley Chodron, a young nun from the xian (county) of Nyemo, whomarchedherfollowers armedwith swords andspears tothelocalPartyheadquarters,andslaughteredboththeChineseofficials and theTibetancadres workingfor them.Atfirst theParty ignored the massacre,thinkingit was a manifestation of the Cultural Revolution[in which]as weknow,murderscouldbe exonerated if theyfell under therubric of class struggleBut the authorities soon realized thattheseTibetanpeasants wererebellingnotinthenameofthe“newlyliberatedserfs\"butindefenseof their faith. What was more, they targeted only Chinese Party officialsandthose Tibetans seen as colludingwith the colonizingpower.Therevolt spreadfromNyemo througheighteencounties of theTibetanAutonomous Region (TAR),and the Party was forced to send in thePLA to suppress it.17Finally,thewell-knownTibetologistHildegardDiembergerbrieflymentions theNyemonun'suprising in an article onfemalemediumsinTibet.ShefollowsShakya’s and Smith's analyses,adding,“What originallylookedlikeaGyenlogattackonlocalcadreswasreappraisedassome-"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Introduction6thing threatening Chinese national interests. This shift was probably trig-geredby the ethnicization of the movement.\"18A very different interpretation,however,has been presented by WangLixiong,a well-knownChineseintellectual whohas studied and writtenonTibet.Herejects thenationalisticargumentscited above and theideathatthiswas theSecond TibetRevolt.Instead,heexplains theincidentas theoutgrowthoftheintroductionofcommunesinTibet:In 1969,an armed“revolt”broke out against the introduction of People'sCommunes intoTibet,which had been spared them in the period of the GreatLeapForward;this eventually spread to overforty counties.The Dalai'scampsaw this “Second Tibetan Revolt”as a continuation of the resistance of thefifties.In reality, the two were very different.During the earlier uprising,thepeasants were fighting, in a sense, for the interests of the aristocracy. In 1969,theyfoughtfor their own ends.They did notwant thepastures and live-stock thathadbeen redistributed among themfrom the old landowners tobe appropriated by the People's Communes....The“nationality question,later the cause of so much trouble,seemed scarcely worth consideration.Tibetans seemed on generally calm terms with theHan and the Dalai Lamaalmost forgotten,both inTibet and in theWest.19This materialistic interpretation prompted a strong rebuttal from TseringShakya,whodisagreessharplywithWang'sview:His account secularizes the rebellion,explaining it in utilitarian terms—the peasants wanted toprotectthe gains of theinitial land reforms fromthe extension ofPeople's Communes—while stripping it of the cultural andreligious elements that revealits nationalist content.In doing so,he grosslydistorts thehistorical record.For example:Trinley Chodron told thePLAafterher capture that shehad beenvisited by abird whohad come as amessenger from the Dalai Lama,and who had told her to drive out the Chi-nese.Other rebels claimed tobe reincarnations of Ling Gesar,the mythicalhero-king of Tibetan epic whofoughtfor the Buddhist religion.There canbe no mistaking the symbolism here.Indeed,we can describe the revolt of1969 as a millenarianuprising,aninsurgency characterizedby apassionatedesire to be rid of the oppressor.20Shakya,Smith,andDiemberger,therefore,explainthisincident asfundamentally an ethnic or nationalistic affair—Tibetans versus Chinese;Barnett's brief comment suggests that he also views it mainly as an at-tack by Tibetans against the Chinese, but against the Chinese-run state,not theHanper se.Wang,on the other hand,sees it primarilyin termsofTibetans'economicself-interest.Wang's dismissalofnationalisticmo-tives has led Shakya to charge that Wang has grossly distorted the his-torical record,but is this a fair assessment?Alternatively,might notIntroductionShakyaand others,inadvertently,have distorted thehistoricalrecord bydownplaying economic and other motives and by presenting this as a Ti-betanversusChineseaffair?In this monograph we address this issue and for the first time pre-sentadetailedexaminationofwhatactuallytranspired inNyemoin1969.We show that while each of the above-mentioned explanationscontains important elements of truth and represents an excellent be-ginning, new data about the history of the Nyemo conflict reveal a farmoreconvolutedetiology thatisinexorablyintertwinedwiththebitterandbloodyfactionalstrugglesthatragedduringtheheightoftheCul-turalRevolutioninTibetbetweenTibet'stwomainrevolutionarymassorganizations—GyenloandNyamdre—bothofwhichbelievedtheywerethetrueadherentsofMaoZedong'sviews.WeshowhowtheNyemoincidentwasprimarilynota conflict ofTibetansversusHanChi-nese but rather an outgrowth of the decision made by Gyenlo's leader-shipinNyemotoseizecontrolofthecountyfromtheirhatedrival,Nyamdre.Morespecifically,weshowhowGyenloinNyemosoughttousethepresence ofwidespreadruralanger and anxietytomobilizeTi-betan villagers to its side and how it utilized a young nun (and the godswho were possessing her)to energize and activate the masses to fightfor it against Nyamdre.The comments of a Gyenlo leader in Nyemo il-lustratetheway the Gyenlorevolutionaries tactically utilized the nuntomotivateruralTibetans:If there is some situation we cannot stop, we will send the crazy one [thenun]to activate them[thevillagers]once againtobeat themback.Themasses believein superstition[religion],so if the crazy one activates them,theywill befearless.That's good!Thisis the greatinvention of NyemoCounty.Wehave to employher.Firstwe send herto do some religiousdances[go into a trance],then we drive the masses to attack.The cadresfrom the Lhasa headquarters agreed with the method we took and indi-cated thatweshoulduse thereligious dances[trances]to activate themasses to attack.Therefore,ifwewant to attack inthefuture,we needto prepare for it; the religious dance [trance] of the nun is the weapon toaccessthemasses”mentalworld.21However,wealsoshowinthisstudythatGyenlo'sdecisiontoutilizethenunin thismannerinadvertentlycreatedconditions thatfacilitated hendevelopment into a powerful charismatic leader who sought to restorereligionandwhomanyvillagersbelievedhadsupernaturalpowers.Therevolutionary leaders of GyenloinNyemo understood that this was hap-pening but, for reasons we will discuss later, chose to see this as adding"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Introduction8to the utility of their “invention” and weapon, so continued to makeprominent use of her right up to the end.

The new campaign in China, the Cultural Revolution, therefore, should also be implemented in keeping with the special situationin Tibet.

Not surprisingly, some of theyoung revolutionaries in Lhasa also wanted to follow Mao's instructionsandattacktheholdersofpowerintheirworkunits.However,such at-tempts were initially blocked by the leadership.

Thesewere ostensibly stolen from the army, but it appears that in reality sup-porters in the army turned a blind eye to such“thefts\" by revolutionaries,if they didn't actually aid in them.

More than three hun-dred cadres attended, including top leaders such as Tao Changsong ofGyenlo, Liu Shaoming of Nyamdre, and Ren Rong of the military region.73The rationale that leaders in Beijing presented to the delegates wassimple.Timeshavechanged,they said.Atthebeginningof the GreatCultural Revolution, everyone rose up to revolt against the capitalist-roaders,but since that time the capitalist-roaders have been exposed. Nowis the time to establish revolutionary committees,which are the true toolforcreatingthedictatorshipoftheproletariat.Consequently,anyfurtherfactionalconflictwouldonlyservetodecentralizerevolutionarypowerand weaken this effort as well as negatively impact Tibet's war readiness(againstIndia).Thus,the assembleddelegatesweretold thattheyhad toagree to end factionalism,because if it were to continue,the revolutionitselfwouldbecrippled.74However,achievingsuch anagreementmeantbringingaboutanewpositiverelationshipnotonlybetweenthetworev-olutionary factions but also among them, the army, and the cadres.

These involved creating a new social hierarchy in which the“poor”were nowvalorizedwhile theformer elites,such aslords,estateman-agers,headmen, and monastic leaders,were vilified and persecuted asclass enemies.In this newhierarchy,individuals and families were clas-sifiedaccordingtoclasscriteria,suchas theamountoflandthefamilyheld,the amount oflabor theyhired,whether theyhadbeenmoney orgrain lenders, and whether they had been lords or agents of lords.3At the same time, the traditional manorial (feudal) system was abol-ished, and the felds and property (for example, the manor house, live-stock, furniture, and farming equipment) of the lords and monasterieswere redistributed to the poorest,usually landless,households.4All in-kindextractionsimposedbythetraditionalsystemwere alsoended,andpeasant families no longer had to provide corvée labor to their lords.Foraristocratic andmonasticserfsinthetraditionalsociety(before1959),this had meant sending at least one person to work without pay for hisorherlordeverydayandmoreattimesofharvest.Theelimination ofsuch obligations was generally welcomed by the peasantry, especially bythosewhohadbeenmiredatthelowerlevelsoftraditionalruralsociety.And thosevillagers who were classified as“middle”and even“rich\"peasants retained possession of their fields and property, since collectivefarmingwasnotinstituted,andtheextendedfamilycontinueditstradi-tional role as the main unit of production and consumption.5 On the otherhand, for Tibetan Buddhism the impact was disastrous.

It required households to “donate” some amount of graintothegovernment.Somevillagersexplainedthisasakindofleasefeeto the state,which ultimately owned the land they farmed,but the do-nation was clearly not voluntary.A second, more onerous obligationwascalled“sales grain”(tib.tshongdru;ch.gouliang).It requiredhouse-holds to sell a portion of their grain yield to the state at government-set prices.7 In theory, this was “surplus” grain the farmers did not needforsubsistence,butin reality theyhad to sell this whether or not it wassurplus.Initially,thesenewextractionsweremodest,evenforthemiddle andrichfarminghouseholds,whichwererequiredtosellproportionallymorethan the poor households.However, after a few years, the size of theseextractions began to increase, in part because the state took a larger percentage,but primarily because the cadres in charge overreported the sizeof the total yields to demonstrate“socialist progress\" and improve theirownperformancerecords.Since thepercentageofgraintobegivenandsold as patriotic and sales grain was pegged to the size of the yield, in-flated yields meant proportionally larger transfers to the government, eventhoughtheactualyieldmaynothaveincreasedormayevenhavede-creased.By the startof1968,thisbegan to create artificialfoodshort-ages,and there was talk that the situationwould become markedly worsein1969,whenhouseholdswouldbeleftwithonly12khe(168kilograms)of grain per person for both their food consumption and for sale in ex-change for all other necessities, such as tea, salt, and clothing.8 Many peas-ants feared that, if this came to pass, their families would not have enoughfood, and they did not know what would happen, since monasteries andrich aristocraticfamilies from whom theycould borrowgrain nolongerexisted since 1959.

That was the way the governmentcollected the grain.13AnotherNyemovillagerexplained：[Regardingthesales grain][a]fter theharvest,wehadto tell our leader theamount of yield we had harvested.The leader usually said that I must havegotten more grain than the amount I said and should add some amount tothe yield I told him.I would say that my figure was the real harvest output,but he[wouldn't listen]and would say that he would give me more time tothink about theyield.I didn't have anything to think about,but I left himand sat outside his office and took snuff.After a while,he would tell methatIhad to add a certain amount tomyyield.Even thoughI told him thatI did not produce that much output,he added some number to my totalharvestyield and on thatbasis did the accounting ofhow many jin of grainI should pay as the donation grain and how many jin of grain I should sellto the state as my sales grain duty. I had to do these two things. There wasno choice.It was mandatory.So since the output was increasing[on paper]every year, the donationgrain and sales grain were also increasing every year. Usually the patrioticdonation tax was reasonable,but the sales grain tax was very heavy.Becauseof this, the rebellion of 1968 and 1969 arose. Because the sales grain obliga-tion had increased so much, many people became poorer and poorer and ..participated in the rebellion and became counter revolutionaries.14Threeothervillagerssimilarlyremembered:Therootreasonfor therise of Gyenlowas that Gyenlosaid thatit was notgoingto[makepeople]payeither thepatrioticdonationgraintaxor thesales grain tax.[It said] that the so-called sales grain was oppressive, andthe patriotic donation grain should be just a small quantity,like the smallfees paid for leased land in the old society.15At that time,Gyenlo mobilizedpeopleby telling themthatif theyjoinedGyenlo theywouldbegiveneighteenkheofbarley.Theyraised the angerof the masses.16Gyenlo said,“Even in the dark and cruel old society,servants were paideighteenkhe of barley as wages,but now in the era of the revolution,wehave only twelve khe of grain as rations.So we are correct torebel.It is nocrime to make revolution.”Because of talk like that,Gyenlobecame largerand larger in Nyemo.17Nonvillagers who were living and working in Nyemo at that time alsoindicatedthatthegrainextractionswerethekeyfactormotivatingthe"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"GyenloandNyamdreinNyemoCounty64villagers.

This was typically done through a ritual called tsago che (lit-erally,openingthe doorto thevein).Thelama at this timewould typically determine whether it was a god or a demon or a ghost that hadchosen to possess the person spontaneously.

These were, of course, the very kind of leftists who had car-ried out the Democratic Reforms and struggle sessions she abhorred.Theanswer, we believe, is that she, like so many other villagers, saw Gyenlothrough a different lens. For her, Gyenlo shared many of her own thoughtsand represented the first opportunity for change since 1959. Like her-self,it was deeply opposed tothe county'sleadingcadres——the same onesshe hated—and appeared tohold compatible ideas about what the newsocietyshouldbelikewithregard totaxes andcollectivization.Gyenlo,moreover,seemed arealisticforcefor change,sinceit asserted that re-bellion against the“bad\"things thathad happened since 1959 was ide-ologically okay,because these were misrepresentations of the true viewsof Mao Zedong. Supporting Gyenlo meant it was okay to rebel againstthestatusquo.TrinleyChodronactuallyhadtalkedfavorablyaboutGyenloevenbefore she joined,telling villagers that they should side with Gyenlo ratherthanNyamdre.FurtherevidenceofherpredispositiontoGyenlocomesfrom statements of Phusum villagers who were adamant that she wanteda Gyenlo armband(ch.xiuzhang)when Gyenloagreedto admither,andlater she actually often wore it publicly.58 Ironically, this was more of aproblem than her mental state, since Gyenlo Headquarters had no extraarmbands at that time, so one of the leaders sent her his own personalarmband.59Consequently,in aboutApril1968,TrinleyChodronbecame amem-ber ofa revolutionaryfaction thatwasorganizingvillagers toseize powerfromitsNyamdre enemies.Withinafewmonths,thenun alsobegan togo into trances with powerful gods and developed a following in the ru-ral countryside as amedium.Over the nextyear,this seeminglyincom-patibleandincongruousrelationshipwithgodson the onehand andMarxistrevolutionariesontheotherintensifiedandultimatelycreatedthe unique texture of the 1969 Nyemo incident.60When someone is spontaneously possessed, a key question is, Whichdeity is doing the possessing?Sometimes the lama who performs the tsagocherite identifies the god,but other times the god identifieshimself orherself after entering the medium's body.

Thus, Ani GongmeyGyemo'sreturntoTibetthroughTrinleyChodronhadpowerfulsym-bolic and political significance because, for Tibetans, Gesar and Ani Gong-mey Gyemo were not some mythical figures in folktales, nor were theysimplylocalmountaindeities;theywererealandpowerfuldeitiesfamousforfightingforBuddhisminTibet.Itisnotclear whether theideathatGesar's auntwasthemaingodpossessingTrinleyChodroncamefrom thenunherselforfrom thelamaChamba Tenzin.

At this time she talked a lot about this story,but nobody checked up to see whether what she was saying was reallypart of the story or not.”However, what she said was accurate, so thequestion of where this idea and information came from is still unan-swered. Nevertheless, regardless of who initially had the idea about AniGongmey Gyemo,toward theend of1968shebecameTrinleyChodron'smainpossessiondeity.Meanwhile,duringthefallof1968,asthenun'sreputationfor accuratepropheciesincreased,morepeoplefromothervillagesstartedtocometo consult the gods sheinvoked,and as Gyenlobecame more powerfulin the countryside, this consultation could be done openly. One neigh-bor recalled,“Asfor the nun Trinley Chodron,[I don'tknow]whethenshe was agoddess or aghost,[but]manypeoplecame toseeherbepos-sessed by gods. She lived near the monastery, so when people went to themonastery, they had to go past our house.Thus,I saw many people goon the road to the monastery to see her.\"72Interestingly, at this time the nun not only went into trances but pub-liclypraisedMaoandMao'sthoughts.Forexample,a Gyenloleaderinthe county recalled, “Zhou Longquan came to my house and said to me,Do you know that recently a lot of people have been to Phusum to wor-shipthedeity?Itused tobedone secretly,but now it's open.Doyouknowthe nun? She is young. She publicizes the thoughts of Chairman Mao.'\"73The dichotomy of hating the local Communist Party and speaking fa-vorably about Mao is not as incongruent as it seems. During the Cul-turalRevolution,asindicatedearlier,allrevolutionary organizations con-sidered that the party apparatus had been infiltrated by reactionaries,capitalist-roaders, and so forth. Thus, opposing the Communist Party ina place like Nyemo did not mean that one opposed Mao and the nation,sinceMaohimself,infact,criticized the oldparty organization andplanned to replace it with a new structure called revolutionary commit-tees.Trinley Chodron,therefore,appears tohavebeenperfectlycom-fortable simultaneously going into the medium’s trances, praising MaoZedong,andbeingamemberoftheGyenlorevolutionaryfaction.Consequently,atthesametimethatGyenlomovedtotakeconcretesteps towrestpowerfromNyamdreinNyemo,thenunTrinleyCho"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"GyenloandNyamdreinNyemoCounty84dronreconceptualizedherselffromasimpleoracleinatinyvillagetoareligiousfigurewhohadinheritedthemantle andcharismaofTibet'smostfamousmilitantdefender ofthefaith.Inthis context,theprophecies of Ani Gongmey Gyemo took on a political tone. Not only did shesaythingslikethatmentionedearlier—thatMaowasamanifestationof the Buddha Manjusri—but also her brother recalled that Ani Gongmey Gyemo used to contrast the roles of Mao and herself, saying thatMao was in charge of allocating material things, but she had come torebuildallthemonasteries,thatis,torestorereligion.74Allofthiswasplausible and popular, and as one villager recalled, “When the nun wasbeginning to be possessed by the Jowo Buddha,nobody supported her,but after she was possessed by Ani Gongmey Gyemo, she slowly becamemorepublic[popular].\"75AlthoughZhangYongfustillhadnothoughtofusingthenuninhisstrategy to displace Nyamdre and take power, he understood the sig-nificance of the growing popularity of this medium who was a Gyenlomember and pragmatically began to say things to appeal to Tibetans'religious sensibilities.

Gyenlo wasstriving to change (improve) the situation in Nyemo and was opposingthesameNyamdrecadrewhomshehated,soGyenlo'ssuccesswouldbeher success.

You should make use of this meeting and sendsome[Gyenlovillage]representatives theretoputupbig-characterposters.\"1 I suggested that it was high time that they started the rebel-lion.They then sent several hundred people to the [collection] meetingin the name of putting up big-character posters.

In fact, although there is no corroboratingevidence for this, Rangjung himself may well have encouraged the nun tostrikeoutatthe“internalenemies.Through attacks like these during a three-week period beginning3June,the nun’s warrior-mediums, together with some Gyenlo activists, killedor mutilated as many as fifteen to twenty Tibetan internal enemies.24These attacks onindividuals createdan atmosphereoffear andterror.Asmentionedearlier,manybelievedthenunhadthesupernaturalpowerto hear whatever they said outside her presence,so they would talk abouther only in whispers in their homes for fear of saying something thatwould anger her. No one wanted to do anything that might in the slightest result in her people arriving suddenly to drag them off to the“slaugh-DestroyingtheDemons andGhosts"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I2Iteringgrounds,”which was the name of the place where they cut off limbsin Phusum. With the blood flowing so easily and the remaining author-ities unwilling tointervene,the nun and her warrior-heromediums feltinvincible.However,thisinvincibility was clearly artificial.As wehaveseen, Zhang Yongfu could have stopped the nun by mobilizing the Mil-itary Squadron in Nyemo to seize her.And the head of the squadron couldalso have taken action when he was approached for help. Of course, nei-ther did,for thereasonsstated above.In the midst of the nun's killing spree, Gyenlo sought to mobilize itsrepresentatives further by holding a ceremony to commemorate theanniversary of the“7June massacre,”the name Gyenlohad givento thePLA's murder of the Gyenlo activists in the Jokhang Temple the previ-ous year. That meeting began with Zhang Yongfu asking the represen-tatives to rise and stand in silent tribute to the martyrs.Then he gave aspeech that criticized the PLA's mistakes, and finally he closed the meet-ing by having the members chant slogans such as “Avenge the martyrs!\"and“Blood debts must be paid in blood!\"25Within a week,Gyenlo's Army of the Gods marched off to collect thatblood debt by attacking the PLA in Bagor and Nyemo.CHAPTER5The Attacks on Bagor Districtand Nyemo CountyBy June 1969, Rangjung and Zhang Yongfu were ready to eliminate theexternal enemies—the remaining pro-Nyamdre cadres, the Departmentof Armed Forces, and the Military Squadron,the last two of which weretheneffectivelyin charge of thecounty.However,asthe time to attackneared,aplatoonoffourteenPLAsoldiers arrivedunexpectedlyinBagonto carry out a propaganda campaign called “cherish the masses and sup-port the army”(tib.maggur mangje; ch. yongjun aimin), which was aimedat persuading the masses to forsake factional discord. Rangjung decidedto attackthosetroopsbeforemovingonthecountyforces.Severalfactorsled tothis decision.First,ifthisPLA campaign wereto succeed in persuading villagers not to support factions, Gyenlo couldlosepart ofits membership and power.Second,and related to this,thesetroops criticized the nun and“superstition,”saying such things as it wasridiculous for the nun to say she went into a trance(and that she was theright hand of Chairman Mao), because it was impossible for ChairmanMao to depend on superstition.1 The troops’ telling the villagers that thenun was a fraud obviously also threatened Gyenlo's support base. Third,Gyenlo'sleaders,as mentioned earlier,harbored deepresentment towardthe armyfor themurder oftheir comrades in theJokhang and,intheireyes,for consistently siding with Nyamdre,even in Nyemo.As one ac-tivist villager from Phusum put it, “After the whole area became Gyenlo,within the Department of Armed Forces some people acted like the RedGuards who had come to suppress us... . At that time . . . we slowly beganI22TheAttacksonBagorandNyemo"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I23tofeel that they were more likely to support Nyamdre than Gyenlo,...and in Bagor District some army soldiers were making the masses suffer.\"2Fourth and equallyimportant,Gyenlo's Army of the Gods was badly inneed of modern weapons, and Rangjung saw this as a possible oppor-tunity to seize some, since he had received a message saying that thesetroopswere armed.Hishopewas tousetheweaponshewouldseizeinthemain attack.3On 9 June, Zhang Yongfu and Rangjung set this attack in motion bycalling a meeting of Gyenlo'svillagerepresentativesinNyemoxiang andinformingthemthatthetimetostrikehadcomeandthattheyshouldgo home and get their weapons ready.4 Two days later, the representa-tivesofNyemo,Ritsho,Nyima,andPhusum tooktheir spears,swordsand Tibetan guns to the nun and asked her to go into a trance and blessthe weapons. One representative who was present that day said thatwhen the nun went into a trance,Ani Gongmey Gyemo said,“It is thesecond timeformetocometoTibettoliberatethisregion.Youshouldfight hard to defend religion. From now on, all power belongs to theBuddha.\"5 Another Tibetan villager who was there had a similar recol-lection:“Whenwe arrived,wewere dividedintoseveralgroups ofthirteen people each. We handed our swords and Tibetan rifles to the nun,whochantedsutrasandspitonthem[atypeofstandardmantricbless-ing].The nun told us,You shouldbelieveinthegods.We are a collec-tion of gods(tib.lha)that are the army todefendreligion,sowe areunbeatable. All power now belongs to us, the group of gods.... Thesebayonets and rifles[matchlocks]are tokill thedemons andprotectourselves.'\"6On the next day, 12 June, Zhang Yongfu and Rangjung held anothermeeting of Gyenlo's representatives and gave them specific tactical in-structions. Rangjung also sent a bunch of protective talismans to Phusumto have Ani Gongmey Gyemo bless them for the coming battle. When thenun sent them back, she sent Rangjung a message: “Kill all the peoplewearing yellow or blue without mercy. With the help of so many pro-tective talismans,we will win the battle in Bagor.7Rangjung's battle plan—using superior numbers to overpower and killthe troops—was feasible because the villagers believed that the nun/AniGongmey Gyemo and the other mediums were supernaturally protect-ing them.Gyenlo's Army of the Gods,therefore,blithely marched off toattackthePLAforce,althougharmedwithonly swords,spears,slingshots,Tibetanmatchlock rifles,and some home-made explosives.Onevillager explained, “We knew they had guns, but we trusted the gods who"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"TheAttacks onBagor and NyemoI24saidthatwewouldnotgethitwithbullets.Wewereencouragedbythat.The nun told the people, “You should visualize that I am on your head.\"So the people went there with that kind of confidence.\"8The villagers,however,did not have to worry about the PLA platoon'sfirepower,becauseitturnedoutthattheywere armedonlywithChair-manMao'slittleredbooks.Inthetenseenvironmentoffactionalviolence,the army thought it prudent to refrain from arming the troops itsentoutto stopfactionalviolence,becauseitfeared,withreason,thatGyenlo might manage to steal the weapons, or worse,that the troopswouldbeplacedinasituationinwhichtheywouldfireontherevolu-tionarymassesandprecipitateanotherdisastrousincidentliketheJokhang killings.9However, once the propaganda troops arrived and set up residence inBagor,they realized that conditions were chaotic and dangerous and al-mostimmediatelysentseveralsoldierstotheNyemoCountyMilitarySquadronheadquarterstoreportthesituation andrequestthattheybegiven some guns for self-protection. This request was refused, as thesquadron's political commissar, Zhang Diantong, later explained in afrankself-confession:IamguiltyofthefactthatmembersoftheBagorMilitaryPropagandaTeam werekilled by class enemies because they did not have any weapons.On 11June 1969,my suggestions were completely wrong.At oneof the meetings,Liang Chao,Director Liu,DeputyPolitical CommissarDing, and I were all there....I clearly knew that the class struggle wasvery intense there[in Nyemo]. However,I was worrying about provokingmore struggles among the factions,soI said,“Losing weapons happensvery often now. If you carry weapons, the class enemies will find a wayto grab themfrom you.It's better not to carry any weapons.You maybring some cigarettes and candies with you. When people come, you cantreat them with something good.\" So finally we decided not to let themtakeweapons....On the morning of 12 June,when theMilitary Propaganda Teamset off,Deputy Political Commissar Ding reported to me,saying,“Someof themhave hidden guns insidebags of rice they are takingback withthem.\"I asked Liang Chao what we should do.Liang was not happyabout this,soI sent someone toget thegunsback.[Consequently][w]hen“6/13”came,our class brothers were[unarmed and were]cruelly killedby the class enemies.I have to admit that Iwas responsiblefor such anunforgivablecrime.10Meanwhile, on the evening of 12 June, Rangjung and the main warrior-heroes led contingents of Gyenlo's Army of the Gods from different vil-lages toBagor District, arriving early the next morning.11 Rangjung him-TheAttacksonBagor and Nyemo"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I25self led about eighty ridersfromNyemo and assumed overall commandof the force, which numbered in the hundreds.

Whenthis group arrived in Tsatsey, they found the district compound (the officesand the surrounding buildings) deserted and wrecked. All the doors hadbeen busted open, and all the glass bottles in the hospital were broken.The grain had also been taken from the district granary, and the district'sstore had been looted. All of Mao's pictures had been torn up.
