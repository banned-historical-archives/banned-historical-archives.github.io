Generally, do not write about these matters; still less may one write commentaries with an air of disdain or satire. This touches on a major issue of principle in our Party's relations with friends outside the Party. Why then should one not relate or comment on these issues? Because after all, these people (regardless of whether they have left our Party or worked on behalf of the Guomindang) went on to cooperate with our Party. They participated in the revolution, and now they've died a natural death – there's no need for us to start bothering with historical problems again. Otherwise, one may lead people to think that we aren't good enough as friends. As for writing about history henceforth, anything relating to major historical personalities or events must of course be recounted on the basis of facts, but this only involves a just and forthright recounting of historical facts – do not crowd texts with unimportant things. Anything involving major issues must still be referred to the Center for approval; individuals may not carelessly issue comments or pronounce conclusions. As for protecting internal secrets, any kind of material may be collected, but only for preservation. They may not be wantonly publicized. This is a major issue affecting the political reputation of our Party – it can not be treated lightly. We hope that this will draw attention from all parts."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 28, June 15)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
