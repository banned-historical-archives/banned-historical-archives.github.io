Prior to this, the People's Daily had already carried a critical article from the Wenhui Daily. This was an appropriately stern approach to treating an error. This kind of approach must be adopted in the face of all errors that occur in propaganda."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Party Committee decided that newspaper and periodicals propaganda and arts and cultural production must \"further sing the praises of the worker, peasant and soldier masses, sing the praises of the older generation of Party members and revolutionaries, propagating individuals less.\" On July 13 last year, the Center also issued the \"Instructions on some issues in resolutely 'propagating individuals less,'\" further clarifying this policy. On the day that the Sixth Plenum ended, comrade Hu Yaobang spoke specifically on this topic. This article, however, raised objections to the policy of \"propagating individuals less,\" contending that the policy was \"unscientific\" from a theoretical point of view; if one propagates individuals accurately, it \"won't matter how often it is done.\" This kind of wording is obviously entirely erroneous."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The concept of propagating individuals less is founded in historical materialism, a Marxist policy of checking worship of the individual. Heroic persona can have a mobilizing effect on history, but in the final analysis, it is the popular masses that create history; individual heroes do not create history. Further comparing great individuals and the masses, it is a question of being a \"drop in the ocean,\" after all. Therefore, accurately portraying the historical roles of individuals and the masses in propaganda means propagating the masses more, propagating the collective more, and propagating the individual less. Moreover, when propagating the individual, place the person in a necessary, appropriate perspective. When the Center proposes less propaganda on the individual, it is done on the basis of historical materialism; even accurate propaganda on individuals must be reduced, which naturally does not include erroneous propaganda on individuals – this goes without saying. This article says that erroneous propaganda on an individual should be reduced. This is assuming that a person who was originally not targeted would thereafter do some blaming of his own. This is deceptive sophistry, and not only that: if an author maintains a position like that, one has only to \"accurately\" propagate and individual; it \"won't matter how often it is done.\" The results of this will be that under the excuse of so-called accurate propaganda on the individual (no matter how often it is done), propaganda on the individual will be greatly expanded – what kind of accuracy is this? We can see that this article, whether theoretically or politically speaking, is totally erroneous. The lesson we should learn from this error is that we should not let ourselves be confused by one deceptive article, by one point of view, but ardently examine it to see whether or not it is compatible with basic Marxist principles."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The Center again requests that newspaper and periodicals propaganda must maintain political conformity with the Center. Central Document (1981) No. 7 states: \"All theoretical problems that relate to the Party line, policy and aims, or to major political issues, must be uniform with Party decisions and statements, uniform with Party procedure; one must not act as one pleases.\" [We] hope that when studying and implementing Central Document (1981) No. 13, all newspapers and periodicals across the country will adopt a stern and ardent approach, carrying out a round of examinations of problems existing in one's own newspaper or periodical, undertaking criticism and self-criticism, summarizing experiences and drawing lessons. This does naturally not mean that one can not have opinions on Central decisions and instructions, but they must be ventilated within Party structures according to organizational principles, by no means carrying newspaper or periodicals propaganda that violates Central decisions and instructions. Otherwise, very negative political effects may follow, which is entirely intolerable to Party organizational discipline."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 58, October 13)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
