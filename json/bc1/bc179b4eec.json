The notice on the use of the “Special Fund” is as follows:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"1. The use of the “Special Fund” is to be limited to handling losses resulting from halting the sale of and scrapping of books related to the “Gang of Four” and “Criticizing Deng and Counter-attacking the Right-Deviationist Trend of Reversing Verdicts.” All losses, including business-related overstock, obsolescence or natural wastage, are to be dealt with by the bookstores according to the “reserve for losses from books that cannot be sold”[3] in the previous [1964] stipulation. Losses incurred as a result of publishing houses notifying [bookstores] to stop selling and scrapping books for other reasons should still be settled with publishing houses according to established practice. The losses from these scrapped books do not all fall within the scope of this “Special Fund.” Scrapped books should without exception be calculated on the basis of the original purchase price."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. The “Special Fund” should be handled by the publishing (cultural) administrations and the financial (monetary) administrations at provincial, municipal, or autonomous region level, and should not be transferred downwards to ever-lower levels. The losses incurred by bookstores and publishing houses in each locality from scrapping the books should all be forwarded through the publishing (cultural) administrations at provincial, municipal, or autonomous region level to the financial (monetary) administrations at provincial, municipal, or autonomous region level to apply for the allocation of funds."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. After receiving the notice to stop the sale of the scrapped books, which has been transmitted through book distribution stores from the publishing houses, bookstores in each locality should immediately start to count their books, tear out the imprint pages and compile an inventory. They should clearly note the basis for the scrapping, and report it together with all imprint pages (wherever they have been published) to the respective Xinhua Bookstores at provincial, municipal, or autonomous region level for approval. After these have been collected, the bookstores should forward them to the publishing (cultural) administrations at provincial, municipal, or autonomous region level for inspection and approval."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4. The scrapped books stored in the publishing houses in each locality, the items still in production, and the funds for scrapping books that bookstores have already settled with the publishing houses, should be compiled into inventories by the publishing houses.

The scrapped books stored in each publishing house directly affiliated with the State Publication Management Bureau, the items still in production, and the funds for scrapping books that the Beijing Distribution Agency of Xinhua Bookstore has already settled with the publishing houses, as well as the funds for scrapping books that the Beijing Distribution Agency of Xinhua Bookstore has not settled with the respective publishing houses (including those central publishing houses outside the publication administrations system), should be compiled into inventories by each publishing house and distribution agency respectively. The publishing houses and the distribution agencies should forward the inventories to the State Administration of Publication for inspection and approval, and apply for the allocation of funds from the Ministry of Finance. The funds for scrapping books in the publishing houses of the Ministries of Culture and Education at the central level should be inspected and approved by the respective ministry in charge, and the allocation of funds should be applied for from the Ministry of Finance."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"6. All funds for scrapping books that have been handled before the end of 1976 and that have already been listed in the annual accounts should not be withdrawn again, nor should one apply for funds again from the financial institutions."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"7. All books that after technical treatment[4] can be distributed publicly or internally, should be technically treated. With regard to books that require technical treatment, each unit should carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, and mobilize the masses to become actively involved in this procedure. The expenses for the necessary treatment can be included in the annual “non-business expenditures” of the respective unit."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"8. A small number of the books scrapped according to the notice can conditionally be preserved for internal criticism purposes. Generally, scrapped books should not be burnt, but should as far as possible be given to paper mills and pulped for further usage. The income from reappraising [the scrapped books] should be included in the annual “non-business income.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"9. The inspection and cleansing work regarding those books whose sales have been halted and which have been singled out for scrapping is a serious political task. The party committees of each publishing house should carry out [this work] meticulously. They should take a firm grip and make sure it is implemented. Everything must be finished by the end of 1977. With regard to the cleansing and accounting work within bookstores in each locality, the responsible persons at each level should be actively involved and supervise it thoroughly according to the given reality.

After having received this notice, each publishing (cultural) administration and each financial (monetary) administration at provincial, municipal or autonomous region level can draw up concrete methods for cleansing [books] and squaring accounts, according to the regulations mentioned above and the regional conditions, and notify bookstores and publishing houses in each locality.

It is approved that a “Special Fund” for scrapping books in your province, municipality or autonomous region amounting to xx Yuan will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance. This fund should be specially deposited in a special account, for specific use, and is not part of this year’s budget. The financial statements for the year of 1977 should be prepared based on total revenue and expenditure. The current year's saving balance can be carried forward for use the following year.

Introduced by the Xinhua Bookstores in 1960, the reserve amounted to approximately 2-3% of the book sales and was to be included in the account as “commodity losses,” which fell into the category of “costs in commodity circulation.” The losses incurred from handling books that they had difficulty selling (e.g., losses associated with scrapping books or selling them at a reduced price) were to be covered by the reserve but in principle were not to exceed the total amount of the reserve. In 1980, a system of “annually appraising the prices of books in stock” replaced the previous method of dealing with these kinds of books (with the exception of antiquarian books and imported books). In this system, the reserve was to be prepared according to the publishing (printing) year of books in stock; for example, if a book in stock had been published (printed) one year previously, a value amounting to 10% of its price was to be included in the reserve; if it had been published (printed) two years previously, then 20% was to be included in the reserve; this was to continue up to 50% of its original price. Books published (printed) in the current year were not to contribute to the reserve. However, the selling prices of books were to remain as before. As is shown here, books annually appraised by bookstores were not necessarily those difficult to sell, but in the system of “annually appraising the prices of books in stock,” the reserve had a more direct connection to the actual amount of books that could not be sold (see http://www.jbfx.com.cn/Issueof/Distributiontheory/20110904/490.shtml)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[4] “Technical treatment” appears to refer to the process of redacting sensitive content."}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
