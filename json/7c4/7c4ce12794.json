No."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The term “legal system” (法制 fazhi) has existed since ancient times. The Book of Rites[2] reads: “Orders are given to the proper officers to revise the laws and ordinances (法制 fazhi), to put the prisons in good repair.” Comrade Dong Biwu clearly explained as early as 22 years ago, “The laws and systems of the state are the legal system.” Generally speaking, the “legal system” is interpreted as “the system of law.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The term “rule of law” has a very clear meaning. To put it plainly, it means to rule the country by law. In a scientific sense, it is to make it so that the law possesses a great authority. The organization of the state and the exercise of sovereignty, and the adjustment of social relationships and personal relationships, all take the law as the criterion. The chapter “Making the Law Clear” in the Guanzi[3] and the chapter “Having Measures of the Han Feizi”[4] both employ the term “rule the country by law” (法治 fazhi). Also, the Book of Rites says: “[The object of] the ancient kings in their practice of music [was to bring their society into harmony] with those laws (of heaven and earth) (法治 fazhi).” Engels used the language of “rule of law” early on: “These laws and ordinances contradict each other and represent not a ‘state of law’ but a state of complete lawlessness.” Comrade Xie Juezai once said in his “Speech on Legal Training”: “We do not want bourgeois legality (法治 fazhi), we want our own legality (法治 fazhi).” Comrade Shi Liang also once said in his article The Achievements of People’s Judicial Work in the Past Three Years, “The people’s judicial work in the new China has made healthy progress on the road to the legality (法治 fazhi) of the people’s democracy.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Why did many of our newspaper articles and publications not use or very rarely use the term “rule of law” after the liberation of the entire nation? There are many reasons, such as the problems arising from sticking to the [old] translation, the problem of carrying on according to old precedents, and the problem of understanding. [We] are afraid that some comrades may retain some lingering fear to this day. For a long time, a considerable number of comrades seemed to have in mind that “rule of law” was a slogan of the bourgeoisie and should not be adopted. They would rather add the definition of “legality” (合法性 hefaxing), “lawfulness” (守法 shoufa) (mechanically following the definition of the Russian term “Законность”) to the definition of the term “legal system” than adopt the clear and concise term “rule of law.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After the overthrow of the “Gang of Four,” especially since the Third Plenum of the Party’s Eleventh Central Committee, in accordance with the Center’s guiding principles of emancipating the mind, starting up the machinery, seeking truth from facts, and uniting as one in looking to the future, forbidden zones have been broken one by one, but there has been no opening with regards to the “implementation of socialist legality (法治 fazhi).” At present, “the people long for peace and stability”[5] and “the people long for law”; the responsible comrades at the central level have also raised and expounded on the great significance of “ruling the country by law” (以法治国 yifa zhiguo). Therefore, we suggest that in research and propaganda work, it is necessary to formally use the term “rule of law”; with regards to governing the country by law, either “implement rule of law” or “implement the socialist legality (法治 fazhi)” can be used and forced and puzzling terms like “strengthening the legal system” or “strengthening... the legal system” should no longer be used in the interest of accuracy and clarity."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Wei Sen"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[1]Translated from Wang Liming, Liu Hainian, Luo Yaopei, “Fazhi yu fazhi” in Xuexi yu tansuo, no. 5 (1979): 33."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[2]Translator’s note: One of the Five Classics, the foundational texts in the Confucian canon, the Book of Rites provides an idealized vision of the social relationships and obligations of the Zhou dynasy."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[3]Translator’s note: The Guanzi is a collection of treatises on the governance of the State of Qi named after the scholar and statesman credited as its author: Guan Zhong, counsellor of the Duke of Qi."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"[4]Translator’s note: The Han Feizi is a collection on statecraft attributed to the scholar and statesman Han Fei.
