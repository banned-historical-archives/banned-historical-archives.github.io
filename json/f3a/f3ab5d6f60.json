Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is a truly important part of the entirety of foreign affairs work. When mentioning foreign affairs, it is easy to solely think of diplomacy, foreign trade, cultural exchange groups and travel, etc. Naturally, foreign cultural exchanges include elements of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, but the entirety of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is seldom included in foreign affairs work. This is a customary, yet incomplete, viewpoint. Engaging in foreign affairs without contemplating propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is not very well-conceived. Past foreign affairs work incorporated propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. When undertaking foreign affairs when Premier Zhou was still with us, it was necessary to contact us in connection with all important issues, making comprehensive arrangements for both foreign affairs and propaganda. Comrade Hu Yaobang places great emphasis on propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. He has said that propaganda aimed at a foreign audience must be treated with a high sense of strategic urgency. He held that propaganda is a strategic issue in the struggle of foreign diplomacy. Comrade [Deng] Xiaoping has said that there are three big tasks for the 1980s: resisting hegemonism, sustaining world peace, and realizing the unification and economic construction of the motherland. Foreign affairs work must diligently engage in these three big tasks; doing so without the use of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience would be ill-conceived."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. All aspects of foreign affairs work, be they diplomacy, foreign trade, cultural exchange groups and travel, etc., are intimately inseparable from propaganda aimed at a foreign audience and must all engage in propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience paves roads for all aspects of foreign affairs work. Assuming that we always engage in propaganda aimed at a foreign audience first, foreigners will make contact with and visit us once they have attained a basic understanding of us. If we successfully employ propaganda during their visits, their understanding of us will be advanced; only then can we build and develop bilateral relations."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I am not referring here to concrete, professional aspects of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, but rather to political aspects. All forms of foreign affairs work must pay attention to political propaganda. This is determined by the actual situation in our country. We are a large socialist country; for a long time in the past, we were not open to the outside world, the opening in our door was very narrow. During that time, we experienced ten years of chaos and are now at a major turning point. Our door has been opened, quite a bit at that, and moreover, we are walking down a new road compatible with our country's national socialist construction. This situation has lured quite a few foreigners, [and] attracted quite a lot of people's attention. All kinds and all types of foreigners want to establish contacts with China; all these people generate an issue of foreigners wanting to know and be familiar with China: what kind of country is China, really? Only when they have understanding of this will they dare to positively and with a relaxed frame of mind come to China. Diplomacy, foreign trade, import and export are like this, cultural exchanges are like this, travel is like this. When engaging in foreign trade, for example, what foreigners are concerned with first of all these days is often not your merchandise or your prices, but whether or not your country is stable, whether or not policy will change, whether or not domestic unrest can occur. When visiting, the fact that our systems are different, policies are different, customs are different, etc., will necessarily give rise to several problems; it will be impossible not to delve into explanations, propaganda, or even struggle, when necessary. If you don't do a bit of haggling, you will not succeed in bargaining. Thus, political and propaganda issues will necessarily come into play. The political propaganda I am speaking of here does naturally not mean that everyone should depart from concrete professionalism to have idle talk about politics, let alone engage in dogmatism or stereotypical propaganda, but rather to speak in compatible terms with one's professionalism."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In summary, regardless of what aspect of foreign affairs work you are involved in, you must simultaneously emphasize the political aspects of propaganda work aimed at a foreign audience. If one doesn't do propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, not a few instances of foreign affairs work will be reduced to a form of routine-minded work. In this way, foreign affairs work will also be carried out improperly. Therefore, we must consider propaganda aimed at a foreign audience as an integral part of all foreign affairs work, including it in one's duties and not considering it beyond one's duties."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. Nowadays, 100,000 foreigners, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, overseas Chinese brothers and foreigners of Chinese origin visit China every year; it will likely increase henceforth. These people are propaganda subjects coming knocking on our door; we must manage our propaganda before them well. Propaganda departments will naturally want to carry out propaganda for these foreigners; this is an inescapable duty. But visiting foreigners are the guests of respective foreign affairs departments; the sum of the propaganda work units' own guests is minute. Foreign affairs departments still have the sole responsibility for direct contact and face-to-face discussion with foreigners. Thus, foreign affairs departments are in the most beneficial, most advantageous position to carry out propaganda before the foreigners. This is an urgent duty for those comrades involved in foreign affairs work. Communist Part members must carry out propaganda at any place, at any time – facing so many foreigners, how could you not carry out propaganda! [I] hope that all foreign affairs departments, making use of their advantageous position, shoulder this honorable responsibility."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In summary, [I] hope that leading foreign affairs departments in all parts will strengthen their leadership of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience should be carried out not only by propaganda departments; leading Party foreign affairs organs and secretaries responsible for foreign affairs in party committees must also rise to this task."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The second issue, promoting visiting foreigners' understanding of China"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Local targets of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience are mainly foreigners visiting China, including resident foreign guests; border provinces also face a problem of propaganda towards foreign countries. Today, I will primarily speak about propaganda issues facing our dealings with visiting foreigners, and how to give them a still better understanding of our country. When a foreigner comes to China, it is naturally because he wants to get to know China, so we must help him understand China. Upon assuming the post of head of the Central Propaganda Department, Comrade [Hu] Yaobang immediately spoke of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. He said that the main reason we engage in propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is to the improve the understanding of, and friendship with, China with the peoples of all countries, so as to help realize the international aspects of our country's Four Modernizations, possibly including benefits for the international struggle against hegemonism as well. Therefore, we must first increase all peoples' understanding of China. Naturally, we must also propagate Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and propagate for socialism; however, authentically properly introducing China is also propagating Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and socialism. To propagate Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and socialism is not to speak empty words; one must propagate by introducing China's current situation. I am thinking of the following few points when speaking of giving a still better introduction of China:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"1. Look ahead when introducing China's current situation."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Give greater prominence to the current situation and future prospects, and less to past complications and problems. This does naturally not mean not mentioning these at all. In particular, do not mention past problems in order to cast present advances in a better light. Many foreigners, particularly overseas Chinese, foreigners of Chinese origin, or those with particular feelings for China, have reported that they do not support our giving further mention to gloomy aspects of the past or present. Actually, the masses inside the country do not want to give much attention to these matters very much either, for example by lending further exposure to films and plays on the \"Gang of Four\"; many people no longer want to see these. Since we have already spoken quite a bit on these issues, everyone's hearts now wish to look ahead, hoping that our country can manage a little better yet. We must not embark on another aspect: when propagating in the past, we urgently spoke of what was good about China, not mentioning shortcomings. Foreigners did not believe us; we have now come to speak of the time of the \"Gang of Four\" in the same way. Always speaking in this way will not help foreigners develop a true understanding of China. Aside from a few opportunists, foreigners coming to China have no great interest in asking about these issues, gathering information about these unpleasant phenomena. The vast majority of people will always want to se and hear that which invigorates them, that which is valuable and happy; they emphasize learning about the China of today. Only by proceeding this way will their understanding of our country be increased."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. Give exposure to the excellent; exploit strengths and circumvent weaknesses"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I am borrowing words here; perhaps the choice is not suitable. This doesn't mean only mentioning the gay, ignoring the gloomy, but rather that when propagating for China, there is an issue of both favorable and unfavorable angles. This is to say that we should present what we truly take pride in ourselves, that which is superior to other countries, will prove attractive to foreigners and is characterized by persuasiveness, not delving excessively into that which is inferior."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There are several aspects we could refer to in emphasizing the favorable in our propaganda, for example: antique culture, famous historic sites, particular forms of handicraft, etc., reflecting the culture and intelligence of the Chinese people– all of these would entail propagating favorable aspects. Ours is a country faithfully building socialism under the guidance of Marxist theory. Even though we are backward in several ways, we are superior to other countries in several fundamental considerations. How is it that our one billion strong population, having suffered setbacks and difficulties, still rallies in steadfast unity behind the Party, persistently walking down the road of socialism? Why do so many foreigners have an interest in China? Why do so many overseas Chinese still hope to return to China? Why do some people who have fled the country now want to come back? This demonstrates that our country has several points of interest to people. Even though some of us who have been living in our society all our lives are colored by experiences from Old Society, and we understand the good and bad of new and old society, we have grown accustomed so that some problems do not appear strange to us. Proposing that people have the chance to receive some more impressions from foreigners visiting China would afford us the chance to see what we have that causes envy or surprise. There are several things that foreigners can not understand that we disregard; there are also several things that we find worth mentioning, but that foreigners do not consider worth further attention. For example, we often introduce our economic situation to foreigners, and speak of how industry is doing, how agriculture is doing. These topics must be propagated; they are also worth propagating. That we are able to feed and clothe one billion people is incomprehensible, yet the topic should not be overemphasized. Foreigners typically appreciate learning about other topics, particularly about personal relations, and trends and fashions in our society. That societal systems differ is most clearly illustrated in personal relationships. In capitalist society, what people dislike the most are hideous personal relationships; these lead to all manner of societal problems. Our situation is quite different. Trends in society are sound, and on the whole considerably better than in capitalist society, despite suffering the sabotaging activities of Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\" and the huge amount of energy required for restoration."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Therefore, on the issue of how to present China, we must double our efforts. In this regard, all areas also have their own favorable conditions and special characteristics; having carefully studied them, these should be fully employed in carrying out propaganda."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. Invest more effort in visual demonstration, use more facts in carrying out propaganda"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Carrying out propaganda before foreigners can be concentrated on two aspects: one is discussing, one is seeing. Discussing is effective, but seeing is still more important. Coming a thousand miles to China, a foreigner naturally wants to see for himself. Facts are the most convincing, most persuasive form of propaganda. We must ardently study the issue of how to allow foreigners to see for themselves. All parts have considerable experience in this regard; we should be able to integrate the experiences, consciously improving this aspect of our work. We should be able to classify those places and things that are of particular value, in accordance with local circumstances, making full use of one's own advantages."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"How to allow foreigners to see for themselves also has methodological and technical aspects that are extremely important in carrying out propaganda. The vast majority of visiting foreigners are not esteemed guests or leaders, but regular people; they are concerned with people's lives, social conditions, trends and customs, etc. If we successfully carry out propaganda on industrial and agricultural production, and economic construction, these topics can also be made interesting. Generally, foreigners are not very concerned about these issues; neither are they very interested. Studying how to allow foreigners to have a glimpse of our society, and of people's lives, is a very important undertaking. For example, foreigners are very interested in law. When visiting countries outside China, one often comes across foreigners asking questions about Chinese law. In the West, just about any matter or issue is inseparable from the law; lawyers must be sought for everything. Foreigners are very surprised that China has no lawyers – how do you lead your lives? Regarding this topic, we may organize ways for them to see how we settle various forms of disputes and cases. As another example, the lives of old people are very miserable in the West; foreigners are very eager to understand the situation of our older citizens. We can arrange for them to go and see how family life is, not only speaking of how large salaries are, but also allowing them to understand the respect for age and the appreciation of harmony, and how to make arrangements for widows, orphans, and old people. This kind of approach can often attain very good results. Many people come to understand China by experiencing these kinds of factual, concrete insights."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When allowing people a look for themselves, never try to deceive or trick. Deception and trickery is counter-productive; effects are extremely unfavorable. Foreigners should be given an understanding of the harmful trends we have advocated in the past; neither should we conceal from foreigners that which is still backward. This touches on a matter of principle: is this seeking truth from facts? Deception and trickery must be persistently corrected."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I will speak further on this, on the issue of how to organize cultural and recreational activities for visiting foreigners. Allowing foreigners to cultural displays in the evenings, or to watch television, are also excellent opportunities to introduce China to foreigners. Some arrangements are unfortunately not very appropriate, not showing them Chinese, but rather foreign displays and performances, so as to accommodate foreign interests, tastes, and customs. The typical foreigner visiting China wants to understand the special traits of a different country and get an impression of the flavors of a different country; if one wants to see foreign performances, there is no reason to come to China."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4. Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience must be carried out systematically"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Few foreigners visited China in the past; those that did were provisionally dealt with. Today, foreigners are arriving continuously, also in greater and greater numbers. If we only deal with them provisionally, we will not possibly be able to deal with them suitably. We must revise provisional habits and the lack of systematic treatment, the lack of preparations, and any home-made approaches. Outside China, no matter where we go, we are always served a well-prepared plate of impressions. Currently, some places here at home have begun to operate in this way; all parts must urgently begin to do the same. In summary, there must be systematic planning."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Foreigners coming to China have differing purposes and backgrounds; some are involved in diplomacy, some are involved in trade, some are here as tourists, and some are long-term residents. We should consider and divide them into different categories, taking the initiative in preparing what to allow them to see, what to discuss, which information to provide them with, strengthening rectification of provisional practices in accordance with concrete circumstances; this approach will generate two-fold results with half the effort."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The third issue, the problem of strengthening domestic propaganda"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience can not be carried out simply by a few people; the masses must be mobilized. First of all, leading comrades must be mobilized. We must eradicate the fear of dealing with foreigners. When speaking of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, comrade Hu Yaobang spoke of the need to be bold, energetic, comprehensive and opportune. He spoke first of being bold, of the need to liberate one's thinking."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The large-scale work of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is carried out by receiving people, and by those people being visited; one could even say that any person a foreigner runs into or comes into contact with gives the foreigner a propaganda impression. Thus, in strengthening propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, we must also strengthen domestic propaganda. We must undertake education of the masses and broader cadre body, particularly among those involved in foreign affairs or those belonging to units that are often visited."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Some parts have edited material for domestic propaganda – couldn't these be distributed? No, they must be edited. There must be some basic educational material teaching people how to behave when receiving foreign guests. The material could include propaganda on necessary aspects of our country's circumstances, policies, and major problems that could relate to dealing with foreigners; on international questions; and on how to carry oneself, be polite, show discipline, etc., when receiving foreigners. Everyone must also rise to the task of strengthening domestic propaganda."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The fourth issue, accurately handling the relationship between political requirements and economic benefit"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Propaganda aimed at a foreign audience is a kind of \"bargaining\" to compensate for losses. Some activities carried out in implementing propaganda aimed at a foreign audience can naturally also have economic benefits. Political demands, however, must be given priority in any situation; economic benefit must not be considered the main objective. Owing to the current emphasis on economic discipline and economic gain, a kind of trend has surfaced in propaganda work aimed at a foreign audience: \"looking towards money\". If gains are large, carry out propaganda; if gains are small, don't carry out propaganda."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Few propaganda tools are currently at our disposal; those that exist, however, are seldom put to proper use. Judging from [Chinese] foreign-language periodicals, foreigners coming to China are hardly exposed to these propaganda tools. There are many reasons for this: postal service problems, difficulties with hotels and restaurants; those involved in producing the periodicals also have marketing difficulties. Books also experience this problem. These problems can not be solved simply by relying on propaganda departments."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There are plenty of areas in which propaganda would be valuable, but there are also those that do not want to receive foreigners, fearing the burden, fearing hassle, or fearing that it would affect their ordinary work. There is also a multitude of names used by various parts and work units for expenditure, for example \"visiting expenses\", \"tea expenses\", \"reception facility expenses\", \"sanitary and cleaning expenses\", \"interpreting expenses\", and so on. Of course, these places and work units have many visitors, and some difficulties actually occur, increasing their burdens. This must generate some methods for solution. Some take fees from visitors, some place the burden on the state, and some place the burden on those units that benefit. Actually, aside from political benefits, these visitors do generate economic advantages. Regarding economic issues, one should also anticipate a large budget and not a small budget."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Furthermore, some problems will always occur when jointly producing films, television, audio and video with foreigners, frequently benefiting of economic gain but forfeiting political gain. This area is fairly chaotic, lacking a unified approach. I ask relevant departments in all parts to please study and solve this issue, aspect by aspect. The Central Propaganda Department is also currently engaged in formulating a solution."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"On this issue of how to handle the relationship between political requirements and economic benefit, I believe we should establish a few principles, for example:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"a. Political requirements are the primary concern of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. If contradictions arise between economic gain and political requirements, one must submit oneself to political requirements."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"b. In our internal propaganda work, do not use propaganda aimed at a foreign audience as a tool for making a profit out of money intended for propaganda. Those who are in dire straits, on the other hand, should be given additional help. When necessary, only retrieving outlay expenses will be sufficient."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"c. In external relations work, propaganda aimed at a foreign audience must administer reasonable fees, accepting smaller profits for larger sales, taking small fees or even no fees at all."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"d. Those units that receive comparatively more foreigners should elaborate ways of supporting propaganda aimed at a foreign audience. This will benefit everyone."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"e. The state will slightly increase monetary provisions or compensation for propaganda work aimed at a foreign audience (responsibility is currently divided between central and local levels; some must rely on local arrangements). Central document 68, issued last year, decided in principle that one must further strengthen efforts to develop expenditure and fee management for propaganda work aimed at a foreign audience."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Finally, we have still to ask that Party committees and foreign affairs departments in all parts strengthen the leadership of propaganda aimed at a foreign audience, setting on a path of speedy development. This work can not be managed by propaganda departments alone; all departments, particularly those involved with foreign affairs, must work in unison."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 54, September 25)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
