During these years, wheat flour became a luxury—most ofit was shipped off to cities.The staple diet in the villages became dried sweetpotato slices, supplemented by corn and other coarse cereals.

This is a much simpler setting, thelocal rebel movement was small, and by the standards of large cities, not particularly“radical\"in the way that this term is usually understood.Let us start with the most obvious interpretation—that the Liansi factionrepresented a“conservative”political orientation based on the vested intereststhat its leaders had in the existing political system.The primary evidence forthis interpretation is that local officials connected with the People's ArmedDepartment,headed by one ofthetophandful of party officials inthe county(Shao Wen), provided steadfast support for Liansi and, in fact, helped to or-ganize it.

Thefirst element to this charge was the fact that a number ofthe purged membersof the former party committee—the highest-ranking being deputy party sec-retary Zhu Pingfan—pledged their support to Paolian. Why? Their motivationclosely paralleled those of ShaoWen and the public security bureau rebels.These leading cadres had been purged by Shao's PAD-led power seizure, andpledging support to Paolian would benefit them if the rebel group prevailed.Second,among the most important early components of Paolian were twoalliances of cadres composed primarily of office staff who had returned fromconducting the Socialist Education Campaign in neighboring counties. Thecampaign that they had been sent to conduct was denounced as a prime ex-ample ofthe“bourgeois reactionaryline,”and these younger cadres were mo-tivated todenouncetheirformersuperiorsforforcingthemtocarry outthismistaken line.

In light of the way that large segments of theformer power structureflocked toPaolian,ShaoWen and Liansi argued thatPaolian was attempting to restore to power capitalist roaders who had beenpurged from office as revisionists. In other words, Paolian harbored the realconservatives. In their view, this was not true of Liansi, which supported amilitarized power structure that had pushed aside almost the entireformercountyelite.Liansi's struggles during 1975 and 1976 in many ways vindicate its self-presentationasFengCounty'strue rebels.Itsmemberswerethevictims ofthe“overall rectification\" pushed by Deng Xiaoping in 1975, and from their pointof view Deng was one of the most important officials stripped of power forrevisionismearlierinthe CulturalRevolution.In theirview,whichalignedwith that ofthe Politburo radicals who were later purged as the Gang ofFour,"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"182CHAPTER9Deng's campaign was intended to take revenge against rebels who had earlieroverthrownthe“capitalistroaders\"inChina'spowerstructure.Whenthetideturned against Deng and his campaign to restore veteran cadres to power,Liansi moved against the veteran cadres who replaced ShaoWen and othermilitary officersinFengCounty.Theseveteranofficialsweretransferredfromotherlocalities,wheretheyhad been overthrownby rebelsearlierintheCul-tural Revolution.Liansi therefore saw itself,with some justification, as a radi-cal force that fought to prevent the restoration of the old order. Paolian,bycontrast,satoutthisfinalphaseoftheconflict.Finally, there is the complicating matter of PLA support. In most otherregions of China,rebels divided overthe question of military control.Rebelfactionswhoresistedmilitarycontrolconceivedofthemselvesastruerebelswho demonstrated theirmilitant spirit and“rebelto the end,”while denounc-ing factions that supported military control as conservatives.These labels,andthe reasoning behind them, were in fact accepted by many early analysts ofthisperiod, just as they were embraced byanti-army rebels.InFeng County,how-ever, the factions did not line up as for and against military control—the strug-gle was over which branch of China's military would implement it. The PLAofficers from the 68th Army were the protectors and virtual allies of Paolianand they persisted in supporting Paolian against the PAD-Liansi alliance untiltheywerenolongerabletodoso.There is also the matter of how this all ended. Paolian had long fought todefend its claim to be the county's true revolutionary force, insisting that thePAD and Liansi were the coercive apparatus of the old power structure whowere stubbornly clinging onto their positions. But in the end, it did not matter.The rebels who were punished as agents of the radical Gang of Four weremembers of Liansi,notPaolian, and only Liansi's leaders were sentenced toprison terms after the death of Mao.Paolian wasfortunate in the end that itslongstanding claim to be the true rebels in the county was denied, ignored,andeventuallyforgotten.Ifthepoliticalorientationsthatdrovethecounty'sconflictsthroughoutthisdecadedefyeasycharacterization,doesthatmeanthatFengCounty'sten-yearhistory of conflict was highly atypical?

These persecution campaigns were widespread across China, and theygenerated many more deaths and othervictims than the factional fighting thatpreceded it. This was also the case in Feng County.11 Although there is littlesystematic evidence that these campaigns focused overwhelmingly on the los-ing side in the factional conflicts, we can reasonably speculate that this was thecaseinmanyregions.As harrowing as the experience of Paolian was during the investigation of“May 16 elements,”and as stubbornly persistent and violent the battles werebetween the two factions over several years, it does not appear that Feng9.Shinichi Tanigawa,TheDynamics of the Chinese Cultural Revolution in the CountrysideShaanxi, 1966-1971, PhD diss., Stanford University, 2oo7; and Tanigawa,“The Policy of theMilitary‘SupportingtheLeft\"10.CalculatedwiththedatasetusedinWalder,AgentsofDisorder11.Walder, Agents of Disorder, p.18o.This was equally true across rural China.See Andrew GWalder and YangSu,“The Cultural Revolution in the Countryside:Scope,Timing,and HumanImpact,ChinaQuarterly 173(March 2003):82-107."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"TROUBLEDDECADE185County was among the most bloody.

The politicalbattles in Feng County, as in many localities in China, did not clearly pit thedefenders ofthe status quo against those with grievances against it. It did rep-resent the splintering and destruction of the old power structure. In FengCounty, as in many rural counties, this left the People's Armed Department asthe arbiter of winners and losers among contending rebel factions. What wasdifferent in Feng County was that a separate branch ofthe military intervenedto restrain the hand of the PAD and dispute its judgments, and it stayed in-volved in the countyforseveral years thereafter.The deep-seated andlong-lasting factional conflicts that resulted were distinctive, and in many waysunusual,but theywere avariation on acommon theme acrossChina,wherethe decisions of military units became the axis around which factional con-flicts revolved.Where Feng County fits in thebroad spectrum of county-levelpolitics during the Cultural Revolution is still far from clear, but its historyshows how even poor and remote regions could be drawn into national politicalstruggles,withdevastatingconsequences.What, then, were these struggles really about? Once factions had clearlyformed,and afterviolentencountersbetweenthemspread,thedrivingforceof the escalatingconflicts was therealization that defeat would mean victim-ization at thehands ofyour enemies.This was as true forPLA andPADofficers——who would suffer reprimands, demotions, or worse——as much as formembers of civilian factions.
