On 25 June 1970, in Anhui, under the charge of “raping Luo Yushu at gunpoint,” he was sentenced to five years imprisonment and sent to Zhanyi Farm in Yunnan for labor reform. Because of this [verdict], his sixty-six-year-old mother became so upset that she died, and his wife divorced him and got remarried elsewhere. His two children relocated with their mother, causing the whole family to fall apart."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After Zhou devoted himself to labor reform, he persistently appealed to the court and his former work unit, asking them to investigate the facts and punish the people who framed him for the crime."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After Zhanyi County Court received the appeal in 1974, judicial personnel with the case record were sent to the Sixth Section of the Fourth Department of the Ministry of Railways, and along with the cooperation of the defense office of the aforementioned section, an investigation was carried out among the masses, which revealed that the case was full of contradictions. The original case indeed involved fraudulent activities and a plot to frame [Zhou], and generated great controversy among the masses. As a result of interference from the Gang of Four, this [case] had never been resolved properly. In February 1977, the court again sent personnel to the Sixth Section of the Fourth Department of the Ministry of Railways, and due to the significant attention that the leading comrades at the Sixth Section’s party liaison group [gave to this case], an investigation was carried out among the masses. Persistently providing Luo Yushu with careful political and ideological education enabled her to finally clarify what happened during the incident. The actual circumstances were: in 1968, Liu Shigan and Luo Yushu had illicit relations. When their actions were exposed, at the time, Zhou Xugui and a few others were responsible for investigating their problems. Later on, during the Picking teams and drawing lines movement, Zhou was classified as “picking the wrong team,” while Liu Shigan used his so-called “picking the right team” status to gain political power. Liu pressed counter-charges against Zhou, accusing the latter of carrying out illicit sexual liaisons with Luo and wrecking soldiers’ marriages. He fabricated the false charge that Zhou had raped Luo during the interrogation process, and also wrote a statement of indictment for Luo, which she then recopied and reported to the party committee of the Sixth Section. Afterwards, under the charge of wrecking soldiers’ marriages, Zhou was subjected to illegal beatings during which he was hung by his two hands. His hands became disabled consequently, and he was almost beaten to death. Under this cruel fascist form of torture, Zhou was forced to admit that he had raped Luo Yushu at gunpoint. To ensure that these false charges were substantiated, Liu Shigan and others also subjected the so-called “personnel members who were in on the secret” to illegal beatings, and forced them to write testimonials. In this way, the charge of committing rape at gunpoint was established, and Zhou Jigui was sentenced to five years imprisonment."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After the truth was revealed, Yunnan Zhangyi County People’s Court reversed Zhou Jigui’s verdict on 6 June 1977 and restored his political reputation. His former work unit restored him to his position and gave him compensation pay. As for Luo Yushu, who had been an accomplice in framing Zhou Jigui, she was spared from formal charges because she had shown a relatively good attitude. As for the key culprit Liu Shigan, who had fabricated false charges and framed good people, he was arrested and sentenced by the local judicial organs."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Selected from People’s Judiciary, Volume 1 (1978)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Menghan Yan"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
