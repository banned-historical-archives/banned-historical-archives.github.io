We mustdeveloptheexcellentsituationanddoagoodjobinmanagingourinternalaffairsandlayasolidfoundation.Shouldwedesiretosolvesomeoftheproblems in the cities and provinces,we first must solve the problemsrelated to the 1ine;and in handling these problems correctly,the fore-mostthingwemustdoisdealcorrectlywiththeproblemsoftheGPCR.DefendingtheGPCRistantamounttodefendingMao'srevolutionaryline.Each of us members of the coumunist party, especially the middle levelcadres,should shoulder this taskeven more so.Soas to understand fullythe great importance of the GPCR,the firstthingwemust dois restudyMao's important directivespertaining totheGPCR. This is our key to understanding the GPCR. There are some indi-viduals at present who have forgotten Mao's directives. There are stillasmallnumberofdistrictswhichcontinuetopracticedictatorshipofthebourgeoisie.As early as the end of 1964, when the GPcR was just getting underway, ata time when the play\"Hai Jui Dismissed From Office'was being criticized,Mao pointed out: \"The issue at point in 'Hai Jui Dismissed From Office'is dismissal from office. Emperor Wan Li dismissed Hai Jui from office,andinl959wedismissedP'engTe-huaifromoffice.P'engTe-huaiwasanotherHaiJui.\"Thisclearly shows that theGPCR was a great politicalrevolutionoftheproletariatagainstthebourgeoisie.Itwasbynomeansasimpleacademicdebate.Intheearlyperiodofthemovement，somepeople fell into this trap and thought it was an academic debate. In fact,under the direction of Liu Shao-ch'i, P'eng Chen and company burst forth,dishingout the revisionist\"FebruaryOutline\"whichwas reallyaimedatprotecting the rightists and striking at the leftists, and vainly attemptedtoguidethemovementontothebourgeoistrackof pureacademicdiscussion.Mao resolutely had P'eng Chen and company step aside and at the same timepointed out that the old Propaganda Department was the palace of the Kingof Hades and that it was necessary to \"overthrow the King of Hades andliberatethelittledevils.\"As Mao has said,we have long advocated thatonce the central organs begin doing bad things, we will summon the countrytoariseandattacktheCentralCommittee.\"Doing bad things\" here meansinstituting revisionism.In Hangchow Mao once asked Comrade Hsu Shih-yu:\"What would you do if the Central Committee began proceeding along revi-sionistlines?\"Maohasrepeatedlydiscussedthisquestion.InMay1966，Mao personallysponsoredand initiatedthe\"16May\"circular which servedas a program document for the GPCR.In this document Mao set forth manyimportantdirectives.Maopointedout:\"Those representatives of thebourgeoisiewho have sneaked into the party,the government,the army andthevariousspheresofculturcareapackofcounterrevolutionaryrevi-sionists.Once conditions are ripe,they wfll seize power and turn thedictatorshipoftheproletariatintoadictatorshipofthebourgeoisie.Someofthemwehavealreadyseenthrough,otherswehavenot.Somearestilltrustedbyusandarebeingtrainedasoursuccessors--personslikeKhrushchev,for example,who are still nestling beside us.Party com-mittees at all levels must pay full attention to this matter.\" Thisdirectivehasalreadybeenpublished.Itisamostimportantdirective.Yet at the 9th and 1oth party congresses there were some who forgot itscontentsandsomewhofailedtorecognizetheexistenceofcapitalistroaders.In response toMao's call,the broadlybased revolutionary masses plungedthemselvesintotheCulturalRevolution.ThisthrewLiuShao-ch'iandcompany into a panic, and Liu Shao-ch'i hastily concocted a bourgeoisreactionary 1ine and personally suppressed the revolution. At this keymoment,MaopersonallyconvenedthellthPlenarySessionof the EighthParty Central Committee, drew up the l6 Articles and studied my bigcharacter poster entitled \"Bombard the Headquarters.\" And so the sweep-ing GPCR got underway.Mao madea lofty appraisal of theGPCR,pointingout that the great magnitude of the GPCR had positively aroused the massesand would have a profound significance with respect to the revolutionizingof the thinking of our nation's people. Mao issued a call: \"you must con-cern yourselves with the great tasks of our country and carry out the GPCRtotheveryend.\"Maoincitedrevolutionaryyouthstofacetheworldandbrave the storm during the course of the GPCR and to temper themselves,becomingsuccessorstothecauseoftheproletarianrevolutionduringtheStruggle.At thistime Maoalso showed concern for the broad masses ofcadresandwarmlydirectedthem:\"You should put politics in command, goamong the masses and join in with them in making the GPCR a success.\"MaosincerelyhopedthattheoldergenerationofproletarianrevolutionistsMaowouldupholdthisadvancedphaseoftherevolutionandrendernewmeri-toriousservicesduringtheGPCR.Bytheendof1966,theGPCRmanifestedanexcellentsituation.Withtheapproach of 1967, Mao, on 26 December, discussed \"the launching of aclass struggle throughoutthe nation and on allfronts\"(Editor's note:The text at this point has: \"1aunched next year simultaneously through-out the nation and on all fronts\"),which involved usurping power from asmall band of capitalist roaders holding positions of power within theparty. As early as November 1966, Mao resolutely supported the movementbythe Shanghaiworkersin rebelling againstthebourgeoisie.When themovement took place,Maowas elated.The 16 Points state:\"Theyoungarethe pathbreakers of the GPcR; the workers,peasants and soldiers are itsmain force.\" Comrade (Chang Ch'un-ch'iao) of the central leadership wasdispatched to Shanghai to support the workers'movement,and manage theAn-t'ingaffair andendorsetherevolutionaryrebelorganizationestab-lished bythe workers themselves.[As stated in}Mao's directive:\"It ispermissible to take action first and report to one's superiors later,\"whichis to say，the event precedes the concept.At the endof 1966,Maoagain stated in adirective:\"There isgreathope for Shanghai:theworkers, students and organ cadres there have all arisen.\"1UndertheleadershipofMao'swarm-heartedcareandtheproletarianheadquartersheadedbyMaoandsupportedbythePLAstationedatShanghai，thereerupted a struggle to seize power from the hands of a small band of capi-talist roaderswithinthe party.ThiswasnotamatterwhichinvolvedShanghaialonebutonewhichinvolvedtheentire nation.If it hadnot been MaoandthePartyCentralCommitteewho seized power,it never would havebeen seized.On 16 January 1967,MaopresidedoverameetingoftheStandingCommitteeandenthusiasticallyendorsed the struggles for power from below. With respect to the powerSeizuresinvolvingWENHUIPAOandCHIEH-FANGKUNPAO,hemadealoftyassessmentofthesituation.Hepointedoutthatthisis agreatrevolu-tion, a great revolution involving the overthrow of one class by another.This affair provided a major stimulus to the expansion of the GPCR ineasternChinaaswellasintheprovincesandcitiesthroughoutChina.On 26 January Mao issued another great call to the people, \"The PLAshould support the leftist masses.\"Maofurthersummarizedthebasicexperiencesofthoseengagedinthestruggletoseizepower.Maosaid:\"Let the revolutionaryfaction of the proletariat unite and seize powerfrom the small band of capitalist roaders within the party.\"He pointedout,moreover,that inthose areas andunits where seizure of power wasnecessary, the aim of those involved should be to implement the three-wayallianceoftherevolutionandpromotetheestablishmentoftemporaryrevolutionary organs which are revolutionary, representative and based onproletarian power. These organs were called \"Revolutionary Committees.\"In January, power was seized in Shanghai. While combating the evil windsof counterrevolutionaryeconomism,the PartyCentralCommittee,the Mili-taryCommission of the CentralCommittee,theCultural Revolution GroupoftheCentralCommitteeandtheStateCouncilsentacongratulatorytele-graminwhichtheyindicatedadesiretoplacethefateoftheGPCRandofthedictatorshipoftheproletariatinthehandsoftheproletariat.DuringAugustandSeptemberof 1967，whileinspectingthethreemajorregions[ofthecountry]，Maomadeamostimportantobservationconcern-ing steppinguptheexpansionoftheGPCR.Maoelatedlypointedout:\"The GPCR situation throughout the country is excellent，not bad.Thesituation as a whole is better than at any time in the past.\"At the high tide of the GPCR,Mao far-sightedly pointed out，\"The presentCulturalRevolution isthefirst of itskind.Manymore shouldbe pro-motedhereafter.WhowinsandwholosesintheCulturalRevolutionwillbe decided by history.If it is badly implemented,the revival of capi-talism at any time will lurk as a possibility.

When reading these directives at the time, it wasoften the case that we failed to grasp their meanings and did not readthemwithcomprehension.Itwasonlywiththepassageoftimethatwebegantocomprehendthem.Wehave aneedtostudythesedirectives.Theyareveryimportantinsofar asraisingourconsciousnessofclassstruggleisconcerned.TheCentralCommitteehasrecentlycollectedMao'sdirec-tivespertaining to the GPCR and published them as a book.Only when Mao'sdirectives areunderstood willwebe able to discernMarxismfrom revi-sionism,which inturn willbenefitthe expansion of the struggle againstrevisionism.Why do I bring this up?The primary reason is that therearestillsome comradesinthe partywhodonot understandthis.2. The great victory of the proletariat. From the series of directivesdiscussed above,it is plain that Maohas initiatedand led thisculturalrevolution with a great deal of determination. At present this revolu-tionhasattainedimmensevictories.Inthefirst place it broughtaboutthedestruction of thebourgeoisheadquartersheadedbyLiuShao-ch'i.Thiswasamajor victory.TheCulturalRevolution atone andthesametime hastemperedthebroadmassesofcadresaswellasthe massesofpeopleandithasbroughtabouta revolutioninthesuperstructureandgreater production in industry and agriculture,greatlyfacilitating theliberation of production power. while numerous comrades have witnessedthis，a smallnumber have failedtocomprehendft.Thiswas amovementwhich quickly manifested Marxism,Leninism and Mao [Tse-tung] Thought onawidescale.Thismovementisproceedingdeeplythroughoutthecountry.Practiceover theselast 8yearsfullysubstantiatesMao'sdirective:\"The current GPCR is absolutely necessary and most timely for consoli-dating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing capitalist restora-tion and building socialism.\"If we had not had this Cultural Revolution,whatwouldthe situation inour countrybelike at thismoment?TheCentral Committee has recently prepared some materials (Lin Piao and thedoctrinesof Confucius andMencius)fordistributionthroughoutthe partyforpurposesofcriticism.Lin Piaoandhiswife，YehCh'un,alongwiththe likes of Ch'en Po-ta,all had an intense hatred of socialism.TThisprompted discussions among those of us working there, and we became veryangry.With respect to this phase of the Cultural Revolution,our classenemiesinsideandoutsideofthecountryquitenaturallyattackedusineveryconceivableway.This is not at all strange.Chiang[Kai-shek]alsohascursedtheCuituralRevolution.TheSovietrevisionistnewsservices have been reviling it for 7 or 8 years now. In his \"571\"counterrevolutionary outline for staging a coup d'etat,Lin Piao employedthe language of the Soviet revisionists to curse us. Yet as Mao has said,\"To be attacked by the enemy is not a bad thing but a good thing.\" Thisprovesthat our handling of theGPCRwas correct.The moredeeplywecriticize Lin Piao and Confucius,[the more]Chiang,the South Koreans,the South Vietnamese and the Soviet revisionists curse us.Froma classviewpoint, this situation is not abnormal.The problem is that within ourown ranks, including people inside and outside of the party, some comradeseven today are still no different than 7 or 8 years ago when they did notunderstand[theCulturalRevolution]，didnottakeitseriouslyanddidnot work hardfor it..Some are even confusing right and wrong,callingblack white and describing the Cultural Revolution as all black,1ikeningittoafloodofwildbeasts.Somehavesaidthatoncestarted,theCultural Revolution was enoughto make one's hair stand on end.In theParty Constitution adopted at the 10th party congress, the Party Resolu-tion states that cultural revolutions will be repeated many times in thefuture.SomehavesaidthattheCulturalRevolutionwasentirelyunneces-saryand should not be repeated again.FEspeciallyamong the upper andmiddle level cadres, one hears all sorts of things. Some say, \"whilegreat victories have been realized from the Cultural Revolution, we cannotsee the victories from where we are.\"TThis istosaythatthe victoriescannot be seen from any place, the sum total being that they cannot beseen anywhere in the entire country.Sothen what need was there for it?As statedearlier,the Cultural Revolution brought down twobourgeoisheadquarters. This was a great victory. How can anyone fail to see it?Whoeversaysthathecannotseeit is placinghimselfoutsideofthepartyand the masses. If Liu Shao-ch'i, Lin Piao and company had seized power,capitalism would have been restored and Chinese society would have re-verted to a feudalistic,semi-colonial society,subsequently becoming acolony of Soviet revisionist social-imperialism,with theheadsof millionsfallingtotheground.Ifthishadhappened，wouldyoustillsaythatyoucouldnotseeit？We say that the Cultural Revolution was necessary andtimely not only for the whole country but for each factory, school andunit. Mao has said, \"rhe correctness or incorrectness of the ideologicaland political line decides everything.\"ThelinesofLiuShao-ch'iandLin Piao influenced these units but only to varying degrees.Mao's revo-lutionary line prevailed in most localities.In some localitiestherevisionist line was fairly well-entrenched,as in the case of the oldPropaganda andOrganization Departments.These twoimportant organiza-tionswerenotunderourcontrol.Nottomentiontheculturalfrontwherethe bourgeoisie had exercised leadership for many years, the influence ofthe revisionist line on the industrial front has run very deep.7Thesit-uation after the Cultural Revolution improved considerably. If control ofthe factories by the experts along with their regulatory,repressive,slavish compradore philosophy is not eliminated, how will the members oftheworkingclasseverbecomethemastersof thefactories?Ithasbeenduetodisturbancescaused bytherevisionist linethatour steel[produc-tion] has lingered on for l0 years. Some enterprises are in our handsonly in appearance.In essence they are in the hands of the agents of thebourgeoisie.SSome are even in the hands of capitalists (Some of the plantsin Shanghai are actually run by capitalists).Should we not have such arevolution in these units,what would happen?How would we be able toplacethepowersofleadershipinthehandsoftheproletariat?Maofarsightedly launched a cultural revolution in order to solve this problem.Buteventhisone was not enough.At present，insomeunits invariouscities and provinces,the key issue is one of leadership.The masses can-not be blamed. We cannot say that the masses are bad. This is not to say,of course, that all of those concerned are bad. Some are good men, buttheir thinking is revisionist and capitalistic.Shouldwepointthisproblemouttothemoneday,thesecomradeswillchangeforthebetter.Some7or8yearshaveelapsedsincethebeginningoftheCulturalRevolu-tion.The problemsinsomelocalities should havebeensolvedalready.Ifone wantstosolvea problem,thefirstthinghemustdoisfinditssource.Onlyby doing so will the right remedybe found.Some peoplecannotmakeadistinctionbetweengoodandbadandattributethebadthings in a unit to the Cultural Revolution, or they regard these badthings asthehereditarydiseasesoftheCulturalRevolution.Thisiswrong. They are the hereditary diseases of revisionism.HHowcantheyberegarded as the hereditary diseases of the Cultural Revolution?  This goesto show that launching the Cultural Revolution was absolutely necessary.Thoselocalitieswherethelinehasnotbeenproperly[implemented]havenot been able to unite and the broadly based cadres and masses have un-covered bad individuals.Some have not done a good job in criticizingLinPiaoandConfucius.Recentlywesolvedtheprobleminl2factoriesinSzechwan.Whatwastheproblem?TheproblemwasthatthecriticismofLinPiaohadnotbeencarriedoutindepth.Webelievethatallprob-lems can be solved, provided we do things in the spirit of the CulturalRevolution.TheTatungtankfactoryhadsomeproblemsforseveralyears.Thistimetheywere solvedin2months.TThemainthingisthatawrongline was implementedthere.Naturallywe donot denythe fact that insome individual units there were some troublemakers.Itwasnecessarytoarousethemasses toisolatethese people.Regarding all problems ashereditarydiseasesoftheCulturalRevolutionmeanstopracticewhatprevailed before the Cultural Revolution.Thingswillbecomeevenworse.At a cadres meeting held in Kiangsi Province,some persons spread thecounterrevolutionarysayings:\"Sweepthetemplecleaninordertousherin the true god\" and \"old marshals should return to their original posi-tions and the rank-and-file soldiers to their camps,\" in an attempt tooppress all rank-and-file soldiers.RecentlyI sawa cable saying thattherank-and-filesoldierstherehaveallrebelledandhaveharassedtwoleaders，placing them under duress but not breaking them.This is a truth[i.e.,a naturaloutcome given the situation in the place in question].Itold somecomradesfromKiangsi:youpeoplearetryingtoreversetheverdictsoftheCulturalRevolution.Itoldthemthisbeforethelothparty congress but to no avail. I told them again during the l0th partycongress but again to no avail. Yet there is no need to worry, theCentralCommitteeis awareofthismatter.(Editor'snote:Notoneofoftheaboveisofrespectable ability[referenceuncertain,tr.]).TherearealsothosewhosaythattheCulturalRevolutionwasallwellandgood but wonder whether it was really necessary to launch it in such afashion.In other words，we should not use the four great weapons andnotarouse the masses to air their views freely,write big-character postersand hold great debates. They do not approve of the limitless revolu-tionary masses or a unified proletariat seizing power from those in powerwithin the party who are taking the capitalist road.The point here isthis:by negating all of this,we in turn negate the GPCR.In a talk byMaoin1967，hepointedout:\"In the past we initiated struggles in thecountryside, in the factories and in the cultural realm. We promotedSocialisteducationmovements.Westillwerenotabletosolveour prob-lems, because we had not found a method--a method which was open and all-embracing，motivating the masses from top tobottom and exposing our darkside.We now have found such a method,namely, the GPCR.\"Totell thetruth,wereit notfortheCulturalRevolution,howcouldweferretoutthose well-hidden renegades like Liu Shao-ch'i?Inthe past，wewerecom-pletely unaware of Liu Shao-ch'i's actions as a renegade,his crimes andhishistoricalbackground.TheywerediscoveredbytheRedGuardswhocheckedeverywhereduringtheCulturalRevolution.(of course, we alreadyrecognized the revisionist trash he openly peddled.）At the same time,hadtheCulturalRevolutionnotbeencarriedoutinsuchafashion,howwouldithavebeenpossibletodiscoverthosenewemergingthingssuchastherevolutionarycommittees,the 7Maycadre schools andthe educated youngpeople settling in the countryside? It would have been impossible to do so.Nor could agricultural production have been expanded so quickly. Had wenothadamassmovementonsolargeascaleasthatoftheCulturalRevo-lution,thedisseminationof MarxismandMaoThoughtwouldnothavebeenpossible. Of course, the Cultural Revolution was a new born thing whichunderwent a process of development and perfection within itself. Mao haspointed out: \"An historical experience worth noting is that a line and apoint of viewhave to be discussed over and over again.Discussing themwithonlyafewindividualsisnotenough.Theyhavetobemadeknowntothemasses.\"In some places at present, the directives of Mao and theCentralCommitteehavebeenblockedbycertainindividuals,preventingthemfrombeing passedontothemasses.Sometimesthe massesaregivendirectives without being told which of them have been issued by Mao, whichof them have been issued by the Central Committee and which of them havebeenissuedbytheindividualsthemselves.Some individuals,when\"praising\"theCultural Revolution,saythat duringthe Cultural Revolution the masses were disobedient; they wrote big-characterposterswithoutgoodreasons;andeveryonetalkedatthesametimeduringmeetings.Wasthisatallcorrect?InactualitythiswasavictoryoftheCulturalRevolution.Mao has long pointed out,\"Our party has got to be lively and fresh andnotsomoribund.\"Mao once told Wang Hai-jung:\"Students can doze offor read novels in class.\"Somepeople donot understandthis.Myunder-standingofthisisthatstudentsshouldnotbeboredtodeath,rathertheyshouldbeencouragedtodaretorebelagainstrevisionism.Intheunits[ofthePLA]therealsoexiststhequestionofunconditionalobediencevis-a-visabsoluteobedience.Yetobedienceisconditional,notunconditional.Those[orders]whicharecompatiblewithMarxismandMaoThought should be obeyed; those which are not should be opposed. In carry-ingdirectivesissuedfromtheupperlevels,wemembersofthecommunistparty do so with an awareness that we must comply with the line and carryoutcorrectlines andcorrectorders.Incorrectonesshouldnotbecar-ried out.Some people are displeased with this idea,saying that it isdifficulttocontrolthosefighterswholovetoofferopinions.Thisisnatural.Presently,political incidents often occur mainly because rudeactions are taken to control these fighters, rather than doing deep-going,meticulous politicalwork.Asaresult，problems have croppedup andcon-tradictions have sharpened. The key problem here is also one of line, asinthe caseof dealing withthe masses.The situation has nowdeveloped[tothe point]thatwemuststudyourideologicalwork andthewaysofdoing it.Using onlythose of the past will never do.We regard this as something good. Some people think otherwise. In asocialist country such as ours,the workers,peasants and soldiers arethe masters.This point should not be forgotten.This was pointed outin the report of the loth party congress.We must have a revolutionaryspirit of daring to go against the tide, such as that of the two youngstudents reported in the papers lately--one named Huang Shuai and theother from Kwangtung.They started out by writing a letter to the JEN-MINJEN-PAO,seeking support.The things they wrote were on the level andquitemoving.Inourviewtheyshouldbesupported.Maorecentlyissuedtheinstruction:\"whydoesanoxhavetwohorns?They are used for struggle.\"He had already made this statement in 1955.Mao also has instructed us: \"We are all communist party members. Why dowe beat aroundthebush?It is necessarytotalk lessandcriticize more.We must rely on our horns,the pair of horns on our head,the masses ofworkers, peasants and soldiers who dare to oppose the revisionist line.\"Some units fear the use of the \"four great weapons\"mentionedinthereportdeliveredatthelothCCPNationalCongress.Theyarescaredtodeath.Uptonowtheyhavenotdaredtoarousethemassestostudythisreport. When the masses arise to wield the \"four great weapons\" and goagainstthetide,weshouldgiveour approval.What havewegot tofear?Only those whoare revisionists are afraid towield the\"four greatweapons.\"Whoever are Marxists and Leninists should support the revolu-tionaryrebellious spiritoftherevolutionarymasses.Maohasinstructedus：\"If we do not even fear the imperialists,why would we on the otherhand begintofear the people?Thosewhofearthe people,whobelievethat the masses are unreasonable, who can only coerce, who cannot persuade,thesetypeofpeoplearenottruecommunistpartymembers,arenottruecommunists.\"Some people cannot accept this statement of Mao; they areinclined only toward suppression, and if they cannot suppress, they makearrests.Some people have said: \"veteran cadres won one victory after another inthe past,but they were repeatedly struggled against in the GPcR.\" Thisis wrong, and does not coincide with the true feelings of the old cadres.Oneshouldsaythattheoldcadresaretheprecioustreasuredwealthofthe party，theywon one victory after another in the past,many of themwere wounded,but they did not think that because of this they coulddivorce themselves from the masses,that theycould put on the airs of anofficial，rather，theyactivelytook part intheculturalrevolution;whentheydiscovered their own personal faults and errors,theyundertook self-criticism.TheymadeacontributiontotheGPCR.Therewerenotjustoneortwosucholdcadres，there weremanyofthem.Thesearethetruerepresentatives of theolder generationofproletarianrevolutionaries.Astotheaccusationthatsomeofthecadrescameunderattackquitefre-quently during the GPCR, this must be analyzed in concrete terms. Maosaid,during his inspection of the three major regions:\"whydidsomecadres comeunderthecriticismandattacksofthemasses?Onereasonwasthattheycarriedoutthebourgeoisreactionarylineandthemasseswere angered;anotherwasthattheybecamebigofficials,got largesalaries,considered themselves something special，put on airs,did notdiscuss problems with the masses，did not treat people equally,were notdemocratic, liked to lecture people, liked to curse them, and weredivorcedfromthemasses.Underthesecircumstances,themasseshadtheirjust grievances,but normally,had no outlet for expression.ThentheGPCR erupted,and when it did，all hell broke loose,and they found them-Selves in desperate straits.\" Cannot these people Mao mentioned be criti-cized?If you can lecture other people,why can the masses not give youSomecriticism?EveryoneisalreadyfamiliarwiththeseinstructionsofMao, but some people have forgotten that. As for those veteran cadres whofound themselves in desperate straits,the principle \"one divides into two\"appliestothem.sSome of them, taking the positive view, accepted thelessonsofexperienceandbecametheveterancadreswhowerewhol.lytrustedbythe masses.Therewerealotofthesecadres,likeComradeMaT'ien-shui of Shanghai, who had had a complete change of heart by the end of theGPCR,who were going down among the masses in even better ways, who wereimplementing the line properly. On' the other hand, there were those whotook the negative view in summing up their experiences,and who,in fac-ing the masses,tried to straddle the fence,who were timid and indecisive,and who in realitywere still divorced from the masses,although theymightonthesurfaceseemtobejusttheopposite.Therewerethoseofyetanothertypewhonevergavetheslightestthoughttothe overthrow of the twobourgeoisheadquarters during the GPcR,andits influence upon the course the nation would take, and who have neverforgotten the masses' attacks against them. After being liberated, andallowedtotakeoffice again,theminutetheyhavethe opportunitytheySoughttosettleaccountswiththemasses.TheKiangsicadreswerelikethis. The results of such actions, however, were that the \"accounts\"invariably settled on their own heads; those who put on \"the three airs\"anddidnot changealwayshadtheir downfall.If thisproblemis notcorrected，thosewhoareliberatednowwillstillhavetobeoverthrowninthefuture.Some people have said:\"I was dragged out and struggled against duringthe GPCR; this is a debt somebody must pay,and they'll be lucky if Idon'tdemandinterest.What is wrong with venting one's anger?\"Weshould shout at these comrades that this is too dangerous!What debt dothe masses of people owe you? Mao asked: \"who gave us the authority wehave?Theworkingclassgave it tous;thepoor andlower middle peasantsgaveittous;over 90percentofthebroadmassesofthelaboringpeoplegave it to us. We represent the proletariat. We represent the masses ofthe people.If we overthrowthe enemyof the people，thenthe peoplewillsupportus.\":\"The most fundamental principle of the communist party isthat we rely directly on the revolutionary masses of the people.\" If youinsist on extracting a payment from the masses,the masses have theauthoritytotakeyourpowerawayfromyou.There is another tendency, and that is to consider Lin Piao's revisionistline as being ultra-\"leftist\"in essence.Actually,Lin Piao's revision-ist line is ultra-rightist in essence, and not ultra-\"leftist.\" It was asfar right as it could be. Not long ago someone in a university said:\"Itis impossible to distinguish right from wrong if the ultra-'left' is notcriticized.\" The greatest proof of this is: who passes judgment on themeritsor demeritsofthe past17years?Thejudgment hasalreadybeenhandeddown.Allthosebig-characterpostersoftheGPCRstatedthejudg-ment;theminutesoftheresettledyoutheducationalworkconferenceoftheCentralCommitteehavealreadyhandeddownthejudgment.Thisistosay that for the past l7years,Mao's line,basically,simply has not beenimplementedontheeducationalfront.Thefronthasbeenusurpedbytherevisionists. The letter of Mao to Chiang Ching stated: \"peking Univer-sity and Tsinghua University have deep-rooted,long-standing,complicatedand serious problems.\" Now some people say that the \"minutes\" are nolonger relevant, are a product of an ultra-leftist trend of thought, andSpread such sayings everywhere. As far as some people are concerned,criticismoftheultra-\"left\"andthe criticismof Lin Piaoarefalseandonly criticism of the GPCR is true.Our conclusion is that \"It is impos-sible to distinguish right from wrong if ultra-rightists are not criti-cized.\" At present, to consolidate the achievements of the GPCR, we mustcriticize the ultra-right essenceof Lin Piao's revisionist line.If wedo not criticize the ultra-right essence of Lin Piao's revisionist line,itisabsolutelyimpossibletoconsolidateanddevelopthetremendousachievementsoftheGPCR.Lastyeartherewasanarticlestudiedbyacertainunitclaimingthatthe young people in that unit were ultra-rightists, that they could donothing correctly，and that they were all bad.If this is true,on whomshall we pin our hope for China's revolution? Who will be our successors?The instruction of the CCP Central Committee on the convocation of CYLcongresses at the provincial level pointed out that the majority of youngpeople are good. If this were not the case, there would be no future forour revolutionary cause,the glory would be gone.It should be notedthatcounterrevolutionaryrumorsare being spreadin some localities,suchas\"sweep the temple clean, usher in the truc god, old marshals return totheir original positions,and the rank-and-file soldiers go back to theircamps.\"The crux of this matter is in the final two sentences:\"oldmarshals return to their original positions, rank-and-file soldiers goback to their camps.\" These implied that all renegades, special agentsandcapitalist roadersweretobe reinstated,andevenLiuShao-ch'iwereto be invited back, and that all the newborn things which have emergedduringtheGPCRweretobethrownout.Thisistypicallyrestorationoftheold,orrestorationofcapitalism.Itmayalsoberegardedasanattempt to counterattackandturn thetables.TThisrumorwasspreadbytwohigh-ranking cadres of the army.It was verybadto spreadsuchthings.For instance, the Liu Shao-ch'i counterrevolutionary rumor wastaken as Mao's instructioninKiangsi Province and wasread to a meetingofamillioncadres.Thisisnot surprising.Thereasonwasthatsomeof our cadres have a rumor mill in their heads. When a rumor reachedthem,theygrindeditoutimmediately.Viewedfromaclassstandpoint，thisis notunusualeither.Some people,although basically good,have long been unarmed ideologically,andareincapableof distinguishing fragrantflowersfrompoisonousweeds.Maoseverelycriticizedthiscounterrevolutionaryrumor andchangeditto:\"Sweep the temple clean, usher in a true god, old marshals return to thefront lines,and the rank-and-file soldiers should be promoted.\" Mao'sinstruction'fullyembodiedtherevolutionarylineonthequestion ofcadres.Weshouldmakefulluseoftheolder proletarianrevolutionaries.This is of the utmost importance.At the same time,we must expendgreat·effortstonurturethesuccessorstothe proletariancause--andnotjustafew，buthundredsofmillionsofthem.Tonotmakefulluseoftheoldcadres is amistake.However,it is also wrong toevaluate a veterancadreintermsofhisseniorityinsteadofhisperformanceinthepresent-day class struggle.The fact that theyare veterans who participated inthe wars and struggles of the past is very important, but it is even moreimportanttoevaluatetheirconsciousnessandperformanceinthepresent-dayclass struggles.If their ideology is revisionist,can they possiblyfight well for the proletariat? It is our belief that, especially incritical times, cadres should not be evaluated only by looking at theirbackground. It is necessary to look at their present performance. Pri-mary attention should be paid to their awareness of the line struggle.Nomatter if they are local or army cadres,whether new or old,theyshould all be thusly evaluated.If an old cadre is in error,he should be first observedand then helped，andbeallowedtocorrecthismistakes.Newcadresshouldbetreatedthesame.However,in some localities now,errant veteran cadres are watchedand helpedand allowedto atone for their wrong doings,but new cadresfoundtobedelinquentarefinishedoffwithoneblow.Whyisitthaterrantveteranscanbeeducated,while errant newcadrescannotbeeducatedandare shotdown?Thisis not fair!It isnot helping partyunitylMaocriticized the great many people who looked down on the Children's Leaguesaying:\"You get to be teenagers or in your twenties and think you're sogreat!\"Now the new cadres have to be modest, prudent, not conceited orself-complacent,or cocky,should respect the veteran cadres and learnfrom them.The veteran cadres should teach,help,and take the lead; thenew cadres will have some problems along these latter lines.Bringingupseveralmillionsuccessorstothe proletarian revolutionisatremendousstrategicmeasure;itisagreatlooyearplan.Weabsolutelymust grasp this great venture well, and cultivate successors from the topall the way to the bottom.On this question of successors,there is notmuchresistanceinthelocalareas,but considerable resistance inthemilitary, and so I have recommended that several men in their thirties beputincommandofthemilitaryregions.As for the GPCR,was it really fine or was it really terrible?This hasbeenadispute of long standing.It wasa recurring themewhentheGPcRwas underway. P'eng Chen's February outline and Liu Shao-ch'i's bourgeoisreactionarylinewereintendedtostrangletheculturalrevolution.Inessence, Lin Piao pursued the same brand of revisionist line as Liu Shao-ch'i. Prior to the 9th Party Congress, he and Chen Po-ta hatched apolitical report stressing productivity which asserted that the main taskafterthe congress wouldbetodevelopproduction.It was afutile attempttolendlegalityto an attackontheGPCR.Mao vetoedthis politicalreport. Mao personally supported and stipulated the line of the 9th Con-gress,maintaining that the revolution would continue under the dictator-ship of the proletariat.After the 9th Congress,under the leadership ofMao's revolutionary line, the great victory of smashing Lin Piao's anti-partycliquewasachievedandthemovementofstruggle-criticism-transformation deepened.But this did not put to rest the dispute onwhethertheGPCRwasfineorterrible.SincetheSecondPlenarySession[of the9thCentralCommittee],rightist trendshavemadetheir appearancesboth openly and secretly.People 1ikeLung Shu-chin in Sinkiang,Liang andChen in Szechwan, and the cadres in Honan were of this type.Theytriedtoturn the criticism of Lin Piao and Confucius away from its general orienta-tioninanattempt tocounterattackandoverturntheGPcR.Theiractionswereactualiypartofthestrugglebetweenthetwoclassesandbetweenthetwo lines,and acontinuation of that struggle.There will be furtherStruggles of this kind in the future. Mao recently said: \"we needanother 10 years on the question of the GPCR.\"Thisis areminderthatwemustbementallypreparedforaprotractedstruggle.1Recently，com-rades seeing articlescriticizing Linand Confuciushave said:\"Ch'inShih Huang made a revolution that replaced one exploitative system withanother，and for that,he was the butt of denunciation for 2,ooo years.Will our GPCR fare any better?\" It is certain that some people willdenounce the GPCR. We must brace ourselves for the certainty that 10years from now，or decades from now,there will still be people who will(urseusandwilltrytoreverseour verdictonLiuShao-ch'iandLinPiao. Confucius died several thousand years ago,and there are stillpeople who revere him; Ch'in Shih Huang had his revolution at that sametime,and as a result,has been cursed by people for 2,0o0 years.ToopposetheGPcRistoopposethe 9thandthe1oth partycongresses.This is not a trifling matter. It is a matter of restoring capitalism,it is a matter of revisionism. In my opinion, in order to oppose thecultural revolution, one must set up a capitalist dictatorship. Comrades,let there be no illusions that the capitalist roaders are gone, that thewords \"capitalist roader\" cannot even be mentioned. When revision of theconstitution and the party charter was discussed in some localities,therewereobjectionstomentioningcapitalist roadersinthetexts.Whatnon-sense!As long as class struggle exists,the bourgeoisie will look foragents in the party and thus there will be capitalist roaders. If therewere no capitalist roaders, all the movements in the past would have beenin vain.The\"three anti\"and the\"five anti\"movements,theanti-rightist movement in 1957，the anti-right deviationist movement in 1957,and the \"four clean-ups'campaign would all have been in vain.This iswhy it is written into the party charter.This is abig issue,not atrivialmatter.Inrelationtosomepeoplewhocommittederrorsof goingthe capitalist road,after getting some aid,they changed their ways.Butdoesthissolvethe problem?Wecannotchangetotheextentthatthere are nomorecapitalist roaders.There werecapitalist roadersbe-fore, there will be capitalist roaders in the future. A few people stillexercise dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over the masses today, and haveeven said there are no good guys among the rebels. Where is the communistparty member spirit in such talks? 1The truth of Marxism,when boiled downto its basics,is contained in one sentence:1It ispermissibletorebel.Our oldforefatherMarxledusinrebellion.SSomepeoplecursedusforhaving built a nation on rebellion. The Chinese Communists, under theleadership of Mao, rebelled against the imperialists, the feudalists, andthe bureaucratic capitalists,won and took over political power.Whatiswrong with that? During the cultural revolution we rebelled against thebourgeoisie, against all the exploiting classes and consolidated the dic-tatorshipoftheproletariat.Whatiswrongwiththat?Some'formerrebels are nowdenouncing the rebels.Theymust havehadachange ofheartandforgottentheirpast.Thefightagainstthelocalbadgentryand the dividing of the land,wasn't that rebellion?  If fighting Chiangwas not rebellion，what was it?Somepeoplehaveforgottenallofthesethings.Naturally,the GPCR was something of a mixed kettle of fish,there was quite a lot of confusion, and a few bad guys wormed their wayintotheranksof therebels.Whatwassurprisingaboutthis?Whenwefirst organized the Red Army, was it that pure?Itwasnot.Thisisanunavoidable phenomenon. How can they curse the rebels as being all bad?If the rebels were bad guys, aren't they denying themselves? They haveforgottenwhoitwasthatledourrebellionsandwhowastheforefatherofour rebels.If a communist does not rebel against capitalist roaders,what does he do?If a communist party member speaks against it,it would be like a betrayalof communism.A communist then,will rebel,will rebel against the bour-geoisie and the exploiting classes. Naturally, as far as the majority ofpeopleareconcerned,thisisallaninternalquestion.whenaquestionof understanding is brought up, they study Mao's instructions, review thespirit of the 10th Congress,and are able to reform:however,as far asthese comrades are concerned,they will find the root of their misconcep-tionintheirworldoutlookandremoldtheirworldoutlookaccordingtoMarxism,LeninismandMaoThought.Theymaynotbeabletoremoldtheirworld outlook in a few days.The two types of contradictions may change;Somemaytakeaturnforthegoodside,some maytakeaturnforthebadside.Theunderstandingof somecommunistpartymembers iseasytore-mold,orcanbecompletelychanged，andthecontradictionsbetweenusandtheenemybecomecontradictionsamongthepeople.SSomecontradictionsamong the people can turn into contradictions between us and the enemy.Inthe mind of some of our comrades,theculturalrevolution is not seenas the necessaryoutcome of the class struggles since Liberation,butlike a bolt out of the blue sky, a morning revolution. There are evenSome people whohave spoken of thecultural revolutionasbeing one hugemistake, as being extremely reactionary. They have even composed a bit ofdoggerel which goes:\"Theoldcadresreturntotheirpositions,thenewcadres go to their units; the support left personnel return to theirbarracks, and the GPCR was one big mistake.\"Isthisanideologicalprob-lemor atypicalcase of idealist historicalview?Theynow lookupontheGPCR as a great mistake, and take no interest in anything that is happen-ingatthemoment，andtheywait.Theyarewaitingforeverythingtoreturn to normal.Then they will be happy.TTheydonotlookupondevel-opment as an ascending spiral, rather they see it as running around inclosedcircles.Inthefactoriestheyimposethesystem of supervision,restriction, and suppression; in the schools they emphasize book learningas the primary objective; they do everything by the old rules. What kindof ideologyisthis?Thisisatypicallyvulgar theoryof evolution.Marxist dialectics and all other things are unceasingly advancing anddeveloping.But these conservatives, although they say they are all fordialectics, they are in fact against dialectics. At the mention ofenterprise management, they suggest restoring the old rules and regula-tions that the masses have already thrown out. They are enthusiastic aboutpaying hourly wages, wages based on clocked attendance, and cash rewards,etc.Theysaythesethingscan arouse enthusiasm.Thequestiontheyhavenotconsideredis:Whatdidtherevolutionsofthepastdecadesdependupon? Was it awards? Was it hourly wages or pay by clocked attendance?It was not. What we relied on was Mao's revolutionary line. We reliedonthe hundred million revolutionaries of the masses.We relieduponmillet plus rifles.If you want totalk about implementing materialincentives,the Soviet revisionistshave implemented them with a vengeance.They have implemented them to the point that industry is stagnating andthey are encountering internal and external setbacks. If these thingsweresuchwonders,thenwhydidtheLeningradworkersrebel?DidtheGPCRdependuponmaterialincentives?Ordiditdependontheconscious-nessofthemasses?OrdiditdependonMao'srevolutionarylinemobi-lizing the masses?Naturally,this is not to say that we do not careaboutthelivelihoodofthemasses.Butconcernforthelivelihoodofthemassesandmaterialincentivesaretwoentirelydifferent things.Inorder toheightenthe productivityof labor,we should look for methodsintheareasoftechnicalimprovementsandinmechanization.Onthebasisof the expansion of production, appropriate increases in the standard of1iving of the masses are necessary,but to implement hourly wages andincentives is not to show concern for the livelihood of the masses.Thiswould be a great slander against the working class.  In building all thoserailroads, did our Railway Corps depend upon hourly wages? These warriorsreceived8yuanamonthandnoincentives.TheydependedentirelyuponMao's Thought.

In the planning work meeting, one ofthe workers made his answer very explicit: he said: \"No.\" He gavethree reasons. He said: \"First, we cannot accept the old systems of'control, restriction and suppression.' Secondly, we are opposed to(?） the mass payment of monthly bonuses.Thirdly,what applied in thepast is not correct now. Production has expanded; we cannot bring out theoldwaysandfitthem withoutmodificationupon the new'situations,justas an adult cannot wear the clothes of a child.\" This worker understooddialectics very well.What he saidwas correct.The situation has im-proved and our guiding ideology must keep pace, and be in keeping with thenew situation. We must be resolutely opposed to retrogression. 1Maohasinstructedussaying::\"we must go on discovering, inventing, creating andadvancing. Ideas of stagnation, pessimism, inertia and complacency areall wrong.\"We must make the Lin criticism rectification all pervasive,wemust carryforward the movement to criticize Lin Piao and Confucius,andsumupthe criticism of Confucius.In orderto criticize the poisonof Lin Piao, we have to overthrow the Confucian shop. Confucius was thefirst thinker in China's history to systematically and comprehensivelypromote idealism.All conservatives adulate Confucius.Lin Piao is themodern-dayConfucius.The criticism of Lin Piaonot onlycan be coordi-nated with the criticism of Confucius, but it must be so coordinated.Wemust destroythe Confucian shop in our minds.Confucius lived duringthe time of China's great social change from the slave society to thefeudal society.He fiercely hated changes in the social system. Hedefended the slave system to the death,and opposed the feudal system.He plotted in vain to stop the advance of the wheel of history.Confuciushadbeentheprimeministerinthestateof Luforonly7dayswhenhehadthe revolutionaryHsiao-chengMaokilled.When hisstudent Jan Yushowedinnovativethinking,Confucius instigatedthe other students to attack him.Mao has said: \"Confucius had some very tyranical traits, and reeked offascism.He attempted to go against the tideof history.Hewas in officelessthan 3 months.Evenwhenout ofoffice,hisrestorationist ambitionwasnot allayed.Hetraveledaroundlobbying for hisideas.Seeingthegeneral fine situation, he decried that 'the rites have been forgotten andthe music lost,'thinking that thesewere the greatest evils.YesterdaytheJEN-MINJEN-PAOreprintedanarticlebyCheChun.Ihopethatevery-one would take a good look at it, for it is very well written.\"(SeeJEN-MIN JEN-PAO,13January 1974articlebyChe Chun:\"Confucius'Doctrineof the Mean Is the Philosophy for Opposing Social Reform.\")Some people have no affection for Marxism, have a lingering yearning forrevisionism, and sigh for it; they have no eyes for the new things of thecultural revolution, and are completely enamored of any old thing.Maohas said:\"The ideologicaland social systemof capitalism isseeingthe time when 'the sun presses on the western hills, the last breath hasbeen spent, the morning guarantees no evening.' The communist ideologicaland social system alone is full of youth and vitality, sweeping the worldwith the momentum of an avalanche and the force of a thunderbolt.\" Whywould acommunist partymember,whohas chosen communism as thegoalofhis struggles,retain such a longing for the old things?Thisisaques-tionwhichwesittingherehavegottostudyseriously.Our mainpurpose istoremindour comradestoseriouslystudytheseriesof important instructions issued by Mao since the cultural revolution,andfirmlybear inmindthethreebasicprinciplesconcerning practicingMarx-ism and not practicing revisionism. Recently Mao said: \"Revisionism willappear in China:  our comrades must be alert for criticism of politicswith nounderstanding of politicsand criticismof themilitarycommissionwithout understanding of either military affairs or of politics.\"Theseinstructions of Mao are suitable for being studied in government, in themilitary，in schools,in the north,east,south and west，everywhere.Heis telling us to grasp serious matters, and these are indeed worthy of ourdiscussion.If revisionism is to appear in China, it will do so in thesuperstructure.RecentlyMaoinstructedandpersonallyrequestedthatwe sing thesong\"Three Main Rules of Discipline, Eight Points for Attention\" because hewanted us to remember that only by being in step can we achieve victory.Wemust haveacorrectknowledge andunderstanding of Mao'sinstructions,sothat we can effectivelycarrythroughinthespiritof the lothpartycongress,unite,andwinstillgreater victories.CS0：4005"}],"authors":["王洪文"],"dates":[{"year":1974,"month":1,"day":14}],"is_range_date":false,"comments":[],"comment_pivots":[],"description":"","page_start":2,"page_end":18},"tags":[{"name":"王洪文","type":"人物"},{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
