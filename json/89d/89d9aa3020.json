Some go as far as to be antagonistic, drawing intense reactions from the masses, demanding their thorough elimination."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With regard to thoroughly eliminating outdated terms and slogans, the Central Propaganda Department specifically issued the \"Circular on problems in handling terms and slogans and character billboards in public spaces\" in September, 1979. In addition, this publication twice raised the issue of thoroughly eliminating outdated terms and slogans, in February 1980, and in August 1981. All parts have done a lot of work on this issue over the past few years, yet elimination has not been sufficient in some places. At the present time, as the Twelfth Congress has already been held, it is necessary to once again ask Propaganda Departments at all levels in all parts to continue to stress this problem. Over the coming period, ardently and meticulously carry out a round of inspections and examinations, executing propaganda in conformity with the Party's Twelfth Congress, organizing one's capacities and sending the masses out into the field, thus thoroughly eliminating outdated terms and slogans, not leaving any traces, and eradicating dead angles. Permanent but problematic terms and slogans carved (or built) into walls, on buildings, or cast into large statues, must also be energetically dealt with according to suitable methods."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 67, November 11)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
