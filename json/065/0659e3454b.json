There are some unhealthy and extremely poisonous books; the publication of these must be checked. We must not give in to hobby-level novelty-seekers or readers with unrefined tastes. There are some books that truly merit our attention for reference (these should obviously not be too many, be strictly selective). Do not hesitate to print a book simply because it seems commercially viable; if the edition printed really is too small, one can seek compensation from one's own publishing profits, or from publishing departments. Those professional departments that select books of some value to their cadres for professional reference and studies should see the task as a prioritized duty to their own cadres."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"An issue of the State Council General Secretariat Petition Office's \"Petition Bulletin\" [recently] carried a letter relating to publishing policy from English-language translator Li Miao of the Ministry of Finance's Office for Foreign Financial Affairs."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Li wrote that visiting World Bank vice president [Hollis] Chenery had recommended two books to him. One was \"Resources and Security\", a comprehensive report on issues in resources and security jointly edited by three departments at Harvard University of the US. It is comprised of separate essays by three scholars, relating to the situation in the world oil market and all energy problems facing developed and developing countries, a series of economic, political and military problems resulting from crises in energy supply, as well as which strategic policies the US should undertake. The second book was called \"Seven Sisters\" and discloses how the world's seven largest oil companies maintain control over the overall direction of the world political situation, as well as its scheming conspiracies with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. These two books have siginificant reference value in determining our country's energy policy."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In seeking to translate and publish these books, Li recommended them to some domestic publishers, but was comprehensively rejected, with the motivation that projected editions were relatively insignificant; since the publishing industry is now fully responsible for its own profits and losses, it can not publish books from which the prospects for profit are small."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The letter points out that some publishing houses currently print a great amount of editions of thrillers in order to generate income. However, some foreign specialist literature that is urgently needed in the realization of the Four Modernizations, that are of great reference value to leading Central institutions, relevant departments and the academic world, are never translated and published, because editions and prospects for profit are too small; this is truly too regrettable! We hope this problem can be solved as soon as possible."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"(Issue 28, June 15)"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by Michael Schoenhals"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
