We hereby transmit it to you with the request that it be implemented accordingly."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Report from Six Departments Including the CCP Central United Front Work Department with Request for Instructions on the Issue of Differentiating Laborers from Former Industrialists and Merchants"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"To the CCP Center:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In 1956, when privately owned industrial and commercial companies were – following their line of trade – subjected to joint public-private ownership, a large number of petty merchants, hawkers, artisans and other laborers were incorporated into the joint public-private enterprises; they were commonly taken to be private personnel and treated in the manner of bourgeois industrialists and merchants. A long time has passed, but this issue has still not been resolved. Beginning in 1969, in accordance with instructions from the Center, a few larger and mid-sized cities implemented differentiation work pilot projects, which attained a certain degree of success and operational experience. However, due to interference and sabotage by Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” differentiation work could not develop further. But now, Comrade Hua Guofeng, in his “Government Work Report” presented at the second session of the fifth National People’s Congress, has proclaimed: the vast majority of those among the capitalist class who have the capability to work have already been transformed into laborers supporting themselves by their own work. Concerning petty merchants, hawkers, artisans and other laborers that were originally part of the working population, as well as those who originally belonged to another class but who have been transformed into laborers supporting themselves by their own work, vocal demands are still being raised by them and their children that they be differentiated from former capitalists; company leaders and employees also consider this as something that needs to be done. In the spirit of the party’s principle of Seeking Truth from Facts, in order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of these laborers as well as their families and children, and in order to consolidate and cultivate a political situation characterized by stability and unity, we think that it is necessary – at the present time – to differentiate these laborers from the former bourgeois industrialists and merchants, thus clarifying their status as laborers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"1. Concerning the limits of differentiation"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The differentiation work is to be carried out exclusively among the former industrialists and merchants (including those who have already retired, requested a leave of absence, are currently in the countryside, or are deceased) who joined state or joint public-private enterprises before or during the high tide of socialist transformation."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"2. Concerning the criteria for differentiation"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The sole basis for establishing the class status of someone is the place occupied by that person in the system of social production."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In the spirit of the 1950 “Government Administration Council Decision on the Division of Class Statuses in the Countryside” and relevant regulations laid down by the party center in the past – in harmony with actual circumstances – the criteria for differentiating laborers are set as follows:"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(1) Those who owned limited means of production and who did not ordinarily employ any workers or clerks, who themselves engaged in labor and who entirely or mainly relied on labor earnings to support themselves, are petty merchants, hawkers, and artisans."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(2) Those who owned a non-negligible part of the means of production and who employed a small number of workers or clerks (one person for commercial businesses, from one to two persons for those belonging to the foodservice industry or communications and transportation, from one to three persons for those within handicraft industries), who themselves engaged in labor and who mainly relied on labor earnings to support themselves, are small-scale proprietors."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(3) Those who took part in the running of an enterprise of capitalist character, but whose personal investment was less than two thousand yuan, who took part in most of the work and who were not in charge of any of the enterprises’ “three powers” (operational management, capital management, and administration of the appointment and removal of personnel or the distribution of rewards and punishment) are also to be classified as small-scale proprietors."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Although small-scale proprietors engaged in mild exploitation, they still belong to the category of laborers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The designation laborer must not be employed if, in the period from when a particular region was Liberated to the mergers of joint public-private enterprises, the criteria (2) and (3) were exceeded for more than three consecutive years. Neither should the few owners of capitalist companies that were converted to joint public-private ownership in the early days after Liberation, and who after the implementation of joint public-private ownership exceeded the criteria (2) and (3) for more than three consecutive years, be designated as laborers."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Those who were employed by capitalist companies and who engaged in mental labor, but who were not in charge of any of the “three powers” of the business, are not to be designated as capitalist agents."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In some lines of trade, such as wholesale, qianzhuang, and so on, even when there was none or only one worker or clerk employed, but large amounts of capital were involved (for example over two thousand yuan), with the profit obtained being comparable to that obtained by a capitalist through exploitation, the designation laborer should not be applied."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"3. Principles for carrying out differentiation work"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(1) Seek Truth from Facts. Confirmed laborers must be differentiated without fail, regardless of how many there are. The implementation of quota restrictions and the like is not allowed."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(2) Be generous when settling issues. In cases where the evaluation could go either way, one should differentiate as laborer."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(3) Use simple and convenient measures. Under ordinary circumstances it is possible to come up with a list of names of laborers to be differentiated based on research conducted by company management. Afterwards, a meeting might be convened with employees in order to get to know the situation and listen to their suggestions. Finally, after obtaining approval from the people’s government on county-level or above the decision may be communicated to the masses and the concerned individual. There is no need to approach the masses for evaluation."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"4. Various issues regarding the treatment of differentiated laborers"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(1) It must be ascertained that the original status of the concerned individual was that of a laborer. If the person engages in labor together with the other workers of the company, mark him or her down as “worker;” if he or she is a cadre, write “cadre.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(2) With respect to political matters, the concerned individual must be treated like any other employee of the company. The person may join the union by following the rules in the union statutes."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(3) Concerning the payment of wages during sick leave or medical treatment, compensation for retirement and termination of employment, compensation in case of death, and all other welfare benefits, one should follow the same procedures as for any other employee. Whenever past benefits were inferior to the ones in the procedures for employees, there should be no retroactive payment. Their job tenure is calculated from the time of joining a state enterprise or jointly-owned enterprise."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"(4) As for how to deal with the issue of compensation for their stocks, it will be considered at a later date."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"5. Issues regarding the organizational leadership of differentiation work"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Differentiation work is a serious political task and the party committees on various levels must earnestly reinforce their leadership."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Under the unified leadership of provincial, municipal, and autonomous regional party committees, and through the joint organization of the differentiation work leading small groups of the CCP Central United Front Work Department, the Department of Industry and Communications, the Labor Union and other concerned departments, serious efforts must be made to carry out this work well, with the ambition of having basically completed it by this winter or by spring next year. [One] must carry out thorough ideological work toward company employees, former industrialists and merchants, differentiated workers, and so forth."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"CCP Central United Front Work Department"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"State Planning Commission Party Group"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"State Economic Commission Party Group"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ministry of Commerce Party Group"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Ministry of Light Industry Party Group"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"All-China Federation of Trade Unions Party GroupOctober 29, 1979"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by the Maoist Legacy Project team"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
