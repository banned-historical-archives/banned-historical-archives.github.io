In late January 1966, Jiang Qing secretly travelled to Suzhou and planned the scheme with Lin Biao and Ye Qun. Then Lin Biao ordered the General Political Department to send people to attend the so called “Military Literature and Art Work Meeting” held by Jiang Qing in Shanghai. This provided the opportunity for Jiang Qing to interfere in military literature and art work. From February 2nd to 20th, Jiang Qing systematically delineated anti-party opinions in the meetings in accordance with her long-standing plot, proposing the theory of the “Dictatorial Black Line in Literature and Art”. The minutes of the meeting were written and edited by Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, and Chen Boda. The “Minutes” incorporated Lin Biao’s inglorious flattery of Jiang Qing stating that she is “good at politics, and professional in art” into official documents. At the same time, they also required the Military Literature and Art Departments to “diligently implement” Jiang Qing’s views at “ideological and organizational level.” Since the publication of the “Minutes,” a small group of careerists and conspirators who controlled the Central Party Committee such as Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Wang Guanqin and so on, has praised Lin Biao, the “Minutes,” and especially Jiang Qing, even calling her “the brave flag carrier of ‘The Cultural Revolution.’ ” They also broadened the theory of the “Dictatorial Black Line in Literature and Art” from literature and art to other frontiers like education, publication, sports, health, public security and so on."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Over ten years practice has shown that the views and conclusions in the “Minutes” completely violate the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They are also totally inconsistent with the reality of the front line of our country’s literature and art. The theory of the “Dictatorial Black Line in Literature and Art” in the “Minutes” completely undermines the literature and art program conducted by our Party since the establishment of the country. They also distort the orientation of proletarian literature and art mentioned by Chairman Mao in “The Yan’an Talks on Literature and Art.” They distort the principle of the Party character of proletarian literature and art. Under the banner of \"banishing superstition\" and \"total revolution,\" the \"Minutes\" reject the outstanding heritage of all Chinese and foreign classical literature. They completely negate the significant achievements of our literature and art industries in the 1930s, and trample over the honorable legacy of the New Culture Movement since “May Fourth” and the proletarian revolutionary Literature and Art Movement. The “Minutes” abandon the proletarian literature and art created since the creation of Marxism and promote counter-revolutionary cultural nihilism and feudal obscurantism. The “Minutes” show no consideration for the inherent rules of the literature and art industries and create many idealistic and metaphysical obstacles. They completely abandon Chairman Mao’s socialist literature and art policy of letting “a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend,” as well as a series of proletarian policies. The thinking in the “Minutes” is that of anti-Marxist, anti-scientific and anti-democratic ideology of feudalistic cultural despotism. The road that the “Minutes” point to is the extreme leftist opportunist path that Lin Biao and “The Gang of Four” advocated."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Over ten years of propagating and implementing the “Minutes” has brought disastrous results. Lin Biao and “The Gang of Four” used the “Minutes” to legitimize their fascist dictatorship in literature and art and the persecution of comrades. They randomly took flowers and called them poisonous weeds, treated artistic and ideological problems as political problems, treated conflicts within the people as anti-party, anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary issues, arbitrarily pointed out artworks and pronounced them to be “poisonous weeds,” arbitrarily vilified and persecuted revolutionary literature and art workers, and struggled against the so-called “Black Liners.” After the Shanghai meeting, based on Li Biao and Jiang Qing’s orders, and Jiang Qing’s way of “watching movies, looking for the Black Line,” thousands of comrades were attacked and negatively affected by their affiliations with around sixty movies that were accused for different reasons in the Military Literary and Art Work Meeting in Beijing. During the Meeting, Lin Biao ordered a “counter attack” on comrades who “attacked the Minutes.” Artists who expressed opinions about the Minutes, or disagreements or doubts, and showed some slight dissatisfaction, had to be labeled as “anti-Minutes,” “anti-Chairman Mao,” and “anti-party and anti-socialist” elements who had to be brutally struggled against and ruthlessly attacked. On 10 April 1966, after the “Minutes” were circulated as a central document, various military regions, departments and many local work units also held meetings implementing the “Minutes” and falsely struggled against and criticized many artists which caused many unjust, false and mistaken cases. Implementing the “Minutes” destroyed the allowing of a hundred flowers to bloom in literature and art. Literary and artistic creation reached an ideological impasse of ossification and phoniness. Literature and art has become impoverished, monotonous and repetitive, taking socialist literature and art into a blind alley and in fact destroying proletarian literature and art."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After smashing “The Gang of Four,” the whole military and country criticized the counter-revolutionary theory of “Dictatorial Black Line in Literature and Art.” Many artists’ unjust, false and mistaken cases were rehabilitated and their blackened names were cleared. However, the fact that the “Minutes” was issued as a central document and has not been withdrawn has become a spiritual barrier for some artists, and affected the complete rehabilitation of some unjust, false and mistaken cases. Therefore, we advise the Central Committee officially decide to withdraw this document, to rehabilitate falsely criticized people and falsely handled cases affected by the “Minutes” based on the principle of Seeking Truth from Facts, and not to ask for different levels of organizations and individuals to take political responsibility of propagating and executing the “Minutes.”"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With respect to the suggestions above, please comment, whether in agreement or otherwise."},{"type":"subtitle","text":"General Political Department March 26 1979"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Translated by the Maoist Legacy Project team"}],"alias":""},"tags":[{"type":"文稿类型","name":"文章"}]}]}
