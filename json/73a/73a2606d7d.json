He was assigned to a glass factory, but was givenordinary manual labor to do, not technician's work. The factory heworked in was a glass complex, made up of three different factorieslocated at different locations in one area of Peking.It was under theChemical Industry Bureau of the city. In all, the enterprise had aboutl0oo employees, and made glasses for drinking; pitchers, test tubes,optical glass.In the factory he worked in the glass heating shop wherehe threw glass into furnaces and drew it out in molten form into tubes.There was no special title, he just heated the glass.This was entirelya machine process, no handicraft involved. Then in l97o, he was transferedto the laboratory where he did chemical analysis.PHedidthis untilhewas transfered to a chemical research institute in the Bureau's systemin l973.

During that period they just didn'thave anyone to handle these things.A document came down from the StateCouncil about the situation of these students who hadn't been advanced tofull status after their practicum, so they changed them. At this timehe was raised to 55, this was the only time he was given a raise duringhis work experience.
