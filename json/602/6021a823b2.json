He saw how the KMT was behaving aftger it returned toShanghai,and he was finally told why his father was killed.He began participating inanti-KMT studentmovement.In December 1945 the KMT secret police killed 4 peoplein Kunming who had organized a pro-democracy movement.Began protesting inShanghai over that issue,and got involved in the freedom and democracy movement.Shortly he discovered the movement was secretly led by the communists,and he joinedthe party as an underground member in 1946,March.Still was only 14 at the time.Continued to participate in anti-KMT movement and anti-American demonstrations (forremoval of American soldiers,one of whom had raped a Beida coed)."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"In September 1948,he graduated and went to Yanjing University,on the industryand technology program.

All the early red guards were children of high level cadres,and theywouldn't let the students who didn't have red chushen participate in the movement.Kuai Dafu at Qinghua criticized this,but the work team said that anyone who criticizedthe work team in wallposters was counterrevolutionary.Iwas dissatisfied with thissituation so I wrote a letter about it to Tao Zhu.Tao didn't approve of what was goingon,he wasn't conservative like Liu and Deng,his standpoint was more like Zhou Enlai's.Mao sent Zhou to Qinghua to give a speech and see Kuai Dafu, and get him out ofdetention.He got all the students out who had been imprisoned by the work team, buthe didn't make a big conflict about opposing the work teams like Chen Boda, Jiang Qing,Kang Sheng did through Nie Yuanzi at Beida.Zhou, Tao Zhu and others were in themiddle on this issue,with Mao and others on the left, Liu and Deng on the right.The Cultural Revolution in thePropaganda Department"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"He was head of the department's cultural revolution group from June 1966 untilvery early 1967.Themain activitywas the criticism of the various heads of thedepartment: Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xu Liqun, Lin Mohan,Tong Dalin.We didn't havestruggle meetings and beatings like they did out in sociey.We had meetings wherepeople gave speeches, criticisms.

I thought that these were people who long ago hhadbeenbeatenby the party.What the CR was supposed to be was to criticize those in power,and toshake up the actual structure of power.I never expected that the movement wouldbecome so violent,and I disapproved of the violence of the red class red guards at thebeginning. But the radical redguards were also violent,although their targets were infact those in power. But they doubted too many people. The standard for being a trueredguard was unclear:Mao'sline.You can find a Mao quote to support differentpositions, so Red Gaurds went after anybody and everybody. But even the radical redguards were a democracy movement that was independent. It was always beingcontrolled by a group at the top,in the social sciences section at the Academy ofSciences, people like Guan Feng's associate Wu Chuanqi, a researcher who was the headof the zaofan pai movement in the academy. Guan Feng supported him in his activities--he had earlier worked together with him as a researcher.Tao Zhu decided to have himinvestigated, since his background was complicated and he couldn't decide who were thereal revolutionaries there.So he sent a work team there to investigate,and put thematerials in the ministry's offices.

So it was very complicated. But the basic activity atthis point in the CR was that mass organizations were seeking approval from above.But different factions were trying to use diffrent groups below as tools in their strugglesSo the Jiang Qing faction used Lin Jie and Wu Chuanqi to attack Tao Zhu. They alsobrought in a bunch ofred18guards from Wuhan to go into our courtyard and call for TaoZhu to come out,and they began a hunger strike.TThis was around December 25 or so,1966. Tao Zhu agreed to come out and talk, and the red guards said that they wantedto record the discussion. Tao Zhu said he didn't want to, said he resisted it (kangyi).But in reality they had recorded this statement secretly and gave the tape to Lin Jie andJiang Qing, and they used it to convince Mao that he had used a violent attitude inopposingthe redguards.That was one thing that sealed his fate.These sorts ofconnections nad influences were behind power seizures all throughout the country:fromRed Flag to the provinces to the cities and to the counties.The masses didn't knowabout this but this was behind allof the power seizures in 1967.The massorganizations weren't really controlling the direction of the movement; they were beingpushed in this direction and that by those above."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"After Guan Feng, Wang Li, Qi Benyu were arrested in mid-1967, there was noway that the CCRG could control the mass factions below.They had a huge network ofconnections throughout the country and were influencing the directioof themovement invarious areas.Once they were arrested,they lost control,and they had to call out thearmy to control it."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"There was a workers'organiztion called hanwei tuan in Beijing, they never gotthe support of the CCRG so they couldn't last.They were active in the fall of 1966,butdidn'treally last into 1967.During the period of criticizing Liu Shaoqi, they opposedcriticizing him.This was a fairly largeorganization.There was also a Beijing gongrenzaofan tuan active about the time of the power seizure in January 1967;they werequickly arrested and dispersed,because they were independent.They opposed thedirection of the CR.The same was true for sheng wu lian in Hunan later on.

These wereworkers,not intellectuals; same is true for the Li Yizhe group in Canton later on.Idon't understand much about this aspect of the CR but I think it is very important.Also,the movement in the provinces was more independent, they weren't easilycontrolled and didn'talways take orders from leaders in the center."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"No. 143"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"8Reflections"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"At the beginning of the CR I thought it was a movement against bureaucratism.Tao Zhu told me that Mao had said that it would take about half a year, then theywouldhaveabigg meeting to study Mao's thought.
