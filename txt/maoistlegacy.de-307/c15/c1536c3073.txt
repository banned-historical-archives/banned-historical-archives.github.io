# The CCP Central Committee's Notice of the United Front Department’s "Request for instructions regarding the problem of re-investigating the rightists among Patriots" with added comments

## June 11, 1980, Zhongfa (1980) No. 50

Central Committee agrees with the United Front Department’s "Request for instructions regarding the problem of re-investigating the rightists among Patriots." Now it is transmitted to you. Regarding the problem of the anti-rightist struggle of 1957, it is necessary to stress the following points:

First, after the smashing of the Gang of Four, the Central Committee decided to remove the political labels for all rightists who still have their labels in place. At the same time, following the principles of “seeking truth from the facts” and “all wrongs must be rectified”, re-investigations are being carried out for the individuals who were once classified as rightists in order to correct any mistaken classifications. This is a significant political measure made by the Central Committee to thoroughly resolve historical residual problems in accordance with the scientific system of Mao Zedong Thought. Concrete experience shows that our party has correctly handled historical residual problems. This measure has received full support from the broad masses and won praise from party members and non-party members alike. This possess great significance for developing a united and patriotic battle-line, maintaining stability and unity, creating a lively and engaging political area, mobilizing all positive factors, turning negative factors into positive ones in the service of Four Modernizations, reuniting Taiwan with the nation, and realizing goal of national unity.

Second, the results from the re-investigation into the rightist problem reveal that in 1957, there was indeed an anti-party, anti-socialism ideological current. A very small number of capitalist, rightist elements did brazenly attack the party and the socialist order. Criticisms of this ideological current and counter-strikes against this attack were completely necessary. The anti-rightist struggle of 1957 clearly distinguished truths from falsehoods and established a new socialist order. This is one aspect [of the story]. But as the struggle developed, the anti-rightist campaign did expand beyond its proper limits and mistakenly classified a large group of individuals as rightists, an error that caused great hardship for many comrades and friends, the majority of which were highly talented intellectuals. The target range was too broad and the strike was too strong. A lot of individuals were given unfair placements.

Because of long-term injustice and repression, many comrades and friends could not fulfill their proper function during the construction of socialism. This is not only their personal loss, but also our entire nation’s loss. This is another aspect [of the story]. The Central Committee believes that a comprehensive historical evaluation of this struggle can only be attained by clearly recognizing these two aspects. To fixate on one aspect and disavow the other does not accord with reality.

Third, to eradicate the severe consequences created by the anti-rightist struggle, it is completely necessary to carry out re-investigations and corrections following the "Criteria for classifying rightist elements" set by the Central Committee in 1957. Individuals eligible for rectification generally fall into three categories: 1) One segment of the group had raised many criticisms and suggestions out of concern. In hindsight, these [suggestions] were beneficial to the improvement of work processes. Classifying these individuals as rightists was a complete mistake and must be corrected. 2) Another segment of the group made some inappropriate comments on key issues pertaining to party leadership and socialist order. They were not against the party or against socialism in their fundamental standpoint. Classifying them as rightists was also a mistake and should be corrected. 3) There are some individuals who did speak or act against the party and against socialism. Yet they still differed from those of rightists who brazenly attacked the party in terms of degree of their radicalism and the manner of their actions. Also, considering that they have actually altered their ways later on, they should receive corrections as well during this re-investigation. Evidently, the number of individuals that should receive corrections is very large. As for individuals with ambiguous cases that may be eligible for correction, correct these cases in the spirit of leniency.

Four, it is necessary to point out that for some time now, certain comrades both inside and outside of the party have completely disavowed the anti-rightist struggle. This is a mistake. To understand the problem, one cannot detach it from its historical context. At that time, there existed the hard fact that capitalist, rightist elements did make brazen attacks on the party. It was completely necessary and correct for us to strike back resolutely. If we did not succeed in this struggle, the entire nation would have disintegrated into political and ideological chaos. We could no longer continue to march forward on the road of socialism.

Five, the main lesson from the anti-rightist struggle is that over-estimating the scope of the class struggle at that time and mistaking non-antagonistic contradictions for antagonistic contradictions led to aggravation of errors. From now on, the entire party must conduct thorough research on sudden great ideological shifts and ideological currents, analyze them in a cool, rational and meticulous manner, investigate their causes and trajectory, and make a verdict in accordance with the objective reality. Keep the problem within its natural purview and limits, and do not enlarge the scope of the problem on a whim. Do not, moreover, make “one knife cut” and initiate political movements that will affect general order. Be cautious and scrupulous when distinguishing between the two types of contradictions, which are by nature very different. Settle contradictions accordingly. If the nature of the contradiction cannot be clearly identified for the time being, treat it first as a non-antagonistic contradiction between people. Do not lightly classified individuals who have committed such types of mistakes as enemies to the people.

In addition, in 1957, the party called upon masses outside of the party to criticize the party in order to help the party rectification process. This was completely correct. Nevertheless, the party’s unwarranted support for the so-called “Great contestations, Great blooms”, which was first suggested by some non-party members, led to gradual development of a nationwide tense and chaotic political atmosphere. This was one of the main causes for the later [excessive] expansion of the anti-rightist struggle. “Great contestations, Great blooms” then evolved into the “Four Greats”, which was regarded as a good method to promote socialist democracy. If the “Four Greats” policy is evaluated in its entirety, however, it not only failed to promote democracy, but also prevented people from using their normal democratic rights. Furthermore, it manufactured disruptions to stability and unity, hindered the construction of socialism, and even produced a state of anarchism. This point is confirmed by the experience from 1957 and further validated by the experience from the Cultural Revolution. Because of this, at the Fifth Plenary session of the Eleventh Party Congress, a decision was made to ask the [State Council] to amend the related constitutional laws at the Fifth Annual Meeting of the Eleventh National People’s Congress.

Six, the Central Committee believes that while the necessity of the anti-rightist struggle of 1957 must be affirmed, the mistake in expanding the struggle must be pointed out as well. Resolutely correct these wrongs. The goal is to unite everyone in looking towards the future and aligning themselves together for the Four Modernizations. At the present, among the comrades inside and outside of the party who have been wrongly classified and will receive corrections, the majority behave quite well, but a few comrades still retain some ideological issues. Some even broadcast erroneous opinions, which is not a big deal, but is not conducive for uniting everyone in looking towards the future. The relevant party organizations should patiently provide them with education and counsel. As for the individuals whose rightist verdict was uphold, i.e. they only have their labels removed but have not received corrections (including Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, etc.), we have to assess their [actions] comprehensively and historically. Some individuals among them once collaborated with our party and performed some good deeds. This point must be affirmed according to the principle of seeking truth from facts. Do not completely disavow their merits because they had made serious mistakes during 1957. Because of this, the Central Committee believes, even for those individuals who will not receive corrections, as long as they are still living, they should be given adequate assistance at a political level and a personal level. Those who can work should be given suitable arrangements in order to make active use of their skills. In particularly, do not discriminate against the relatives and children of individuals who were not rectified. Central Committee hopes party committee at every level will continue to implement the regulations listed in related central documents and perform this task well from start to finish.
