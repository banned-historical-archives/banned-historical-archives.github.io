# CCP Center Directive on how to handle the issue of wrongful arrests, wrongful imprisonments, wrongful sentencings, and wrongful executions that have occurred in the past in people’s courts on various levels (Excerpt)

## (April 7, 1953)

(1) Any case of truly wrongful arrest, wrongful imprisonment, wrongful sentencing, or wrongful execution has to be cleared up. In the concrete process of clearing up, firstly differentiate whether the object having been arrested, imprisoned, sentenced, or executed belongs among completely innocent people or is truly a counterrevolutionary element, reactionary landlord element, corrupt element, [or] thieving element of the “five aspects.”[1] Any wrongfully arrested or wrongfully imprisoned person belonging to the completely innocent people must be released immediately; any wrongfully sentenced person must have their verdict reversed; any wrongfully executed person must be rehabilitated. After reversing the unjust charges, there must be an apology to the concerned person or their family; and with regards to a person who has suffered a substantial injury or the family of a wrongfully executed person, in addition to the apology, there must be a necessary compensation or relief, as appropriate according to the circumstances. Any truly counterrevolutionary element, reactionary landlord element, corrupt element, or thieving element belonging to the “five aspects” – even in the event that the court was somewhat harsh in its punishment, a counterrevolutionary was executed in a case where it was marginal whether to execute, or an overly harsh punishment was applied so as to assuage the masses’ anger[2] – must be treated as [the object of] a wrongful sentencing or wrongful execution to be revised and reversed, so as to prevent dissatisfaction among the fundamental masses[3] and counterattacks by bad elements, which would cause disorder where there should be none.

Secondly, there must be a distinction about whether the sentence is fundamentally mistaken, turning the black and white on its head, or just has a bias toward an overly lenient or overly harsh assessment in terms of punishment.

In the former case, one should adopt a spirit of promptly revising any error, seeking truth from facts to revise and reverse the sentences. In the latter case, it is generally not necessary to revise sentences, even when they concern cases among the people, except for when there has been a major bias due to minor offenses being harshly punished, but one must sum up the experiences and lessons so as to improve the work from now on.

(2) As for negligent personnel and elements disregarding the law and throwing the rule into disorder who have conducted wrongful arrests, wrongful imprisonments, wrongful sentencing, wrongful executions, and other errors, they must be dealt with in a suitable manner. However, in the practical handling of [such cases], one must carefully analyze the nature of the error that has been made and the severity of the circumstances, [and] treat [each type] differently, by no means should one treat them in a cursory fashion and plunge into action. For those elements who have put wrongful arrest, wrongful imprisonment, wrongful sentencing, and wrongful executions into practice [in the interest of] embezzling money, engaging in corruption and abusing the law, deliberately framing good people or intentionally covering up bad elements, they must be dismissed and punished according to the law. If the related personnel are party members, they must implement party discipline; in the most serious cases the sentence should be the ultimate punishment. As for those who have brought about major miscarriages of justice due to a work style of grave and vile bureaucracy, refusal to assume responsibility, or negligent conduct, which has left the concerned party destitute and caused major political harm to party and government, [they] should receive a suitable punishment in accordance with party discipline and state laws even if they are not bad elements, otherwise it will not be sufficient to calm the people’s grievances and restore the political influence of party and government. However, only a tiny minority among the judicial staff who have committed mistakes can be elements subjected to party punishment, administrative sanctions, and legal punishment; the scope of the attack must absolutely not be too wide. As for those who have handed out mistaken sentences due to their limited understanding of policy, lack of experience, one-sided thinking, or because an excessive number of cases have led them to rush the work and hurry to process cases, but without serious losses for the concerned party, they should generally be exempted from punishment. However, experiences and lessons must be summarized for the purpose of education and to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

(3) Many unjust verdicts involve false accusations. When it comes to rehabilitation, the responsible cadres and law enforcement agencies must, in principle, begin by taking responsibility for the unjust charges and then deal with the problem of the false accusations. When dealing with the problem of false accusations, it is necessary to distinguish between “false accusations” and “erroneous accusations”; one must distinguish accusers who are bad elements who have deliberately trapped good people or accusers who have taken vengeance on the accused by inflicting significant damages through false accusations from erroneous accusations that occurred as the result of hearsay, allegations made out of thin air, or from suspicion being taken as fact. In the latter cases, there should generally be no further investigation, so as to avoid obstructing channels for criticism, causing the people to lose the courage to come forward with their complaints, or even causing new unjust verdicts.

(4) As for the clearing up and reversal of wrongful arrests, wrongful imprisonment, wrongful sentencing, and wrongful executions, it must be carried out earnestly and seriously, but there is no need to carry out excessive propaganda in the newspapers or strive to make a large spectacle of it. The various localities must carry out these matters with earnest and care. After the reversal of an unjust verdict, for wrongfully sentenced cases that are significant and representative, one should select those that are relevant for the education of cadres and the masses and publish them in their entirety in the local press, along with [comments on] concrete measures and lessons drawn from the experience. As for cases of wrongful sentencing that have had considerable effects among the masses, they should also be publicized among the masses within appropriate limits, but there is no need to feature them in the press. As for cases without significant influence among the masses and in which the error of the sentence is not severe, it is sufficient to announce the correction to the concerned person. As for which cases should be published in the local press, reviews and decisions are up to the provincial and municipal party committees.

(5) While carrying out rehabilitation and dealing with criminally negligent personnel, one should simultaneously commend the good courts and good judges who are commonly recognized by the masses as living up to their reputation, or else persons involved in the handling of major cases who are capable of carrying out investigations conscientiously, upholding principle, and engaging in struggle against those who break the law and violate discipline, as well as those among the masses who are upright and selfless, report bad people and bad things, and have contributed to the reversal of unjust charges, so as to publicize good examples together with bad examples as far as possible.

(6) The review and reversal of cases with a wrongful sentence, especially major cases with a wrongful sentence, is an extremely complicated and meticulous operation. At the same time, based on past experience, if the reversal is to be left to the original judges themselves, it is only when the original judges are comparatively strong in party spirit and in terms of politics that they will be able to carry it out. Therefore, comrades in charge of party and government organs must personally maintain a firm grip on and leadership over rehabilitation, and furthermore suitable cadres should be deployed to assist the relevant political and legal departments to carry out this work; it absolutely cannot be left to run its course. As for the revision and reversal of unjust cases, the organ that originally handed out the verdict or the higher-level organ that originally ratified the decision should review and decide [on the matter].

(7) It is necessary to reiterate the ban on extorting confessions by torture and on any arrest or detention of people without first going through investigation and the procedures of approval. Dealing with cases of wrongful arrest, wrongful imprisonment, wrongful sentencing, and wrongful execution is a matter that concerns the lives and property of many people and the political influence of the party and the government among the popular masses. Therefore, it is necessary, on the one hand, to oppose the tendency toward turning a blind eye toward this [issue], treating it with apathy and indifference, with fear for the exposure of mistakes and the correction of mistakes, attempting to muddle through the work while letting the error persist and, on the other hand, to oppose the tendency toward a lack of analysis of the concrete circumstances of the case, disregarding the severity of the error, disregarding whether the punished person is a counterrevolutionary or other type of criminal, revising and reversing each and every case containing minor errors, and taking a dark view on all judicial organs and denying everything because of an X percentage of wrongful sentenced cases. Even stronger opposition is needed against the tendency to not earnestly clear up and review cases and to not carefully analyze the reasons behind the personnel’s wrongful sentence and the severity of the circumstances while punishing cadres in a simplistic and rude manner.
