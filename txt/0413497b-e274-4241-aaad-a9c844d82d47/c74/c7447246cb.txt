一THEBEIJINGREDGUARDS

AnIntroductionFor more than two full years after the middle of 1966, the world's largestcommunist state was torn apart by mass protests and chaoticlocalrebel-lions that in some regions escalated into virtual civil war. Not until Au-gust 1968 were the flames of China's Cultural Revolution extinguishedby the imposition of aharshregime of martial law.These two chaoticyears of political warfare were the defining moment of the Mao era anda traumatic watershed in the history of the People's Republic of China,but the mass movements of this period remain inadequately documentedandpoorlyunderstood.The most puzzling feature of these upheavals was their intense faction-alism. Seemingly everywhere, organized militants divided into two fac-tions that fought each other for control of schools, workplaces, and localgovernments. Both sides pledged loyalty to Mao and the CommunistParty; both portrayed their fight as a defense of the revolution and an at-tackonleaders whohadbetrayed the cause.In the nation's capital,stu-dent red guards were divided from the very inception of the movementin August 1966.These divisions rapidly evolved into a conflict betweentwo alliances that dominated the earlypolitics ofBeijing's CulturalRev-olution.After one side was defeated and denounced as“conservative”attheendof1966,thevictoriouscoalitionimmediatelysplitintotwocompletely newfactions.Despite the constant entreaties of their elitesponsors and repeated attempts to force them to unite,the two sidesfought with increasingly violent intensity until August 1968, when MaoZedong ordered the army to occupy the campuses, disband student or-ganizations, and detain their leaders for reeducation. Paralyzing fac-tional conflict had turned the red guards into a frustrating political lia-bility.

TheBeijingRedGuardsThese factional divisions have long been viewed as the key to unlock-ing the central puzzles of the red guard movement.Whowere theserebels,andwhatweretheirmotivations?Whydidtheydivideintotwoopposing groups and engage in violent warfare despite sharing a pro-fessedloyaltytoMao?Whydidtheyrefusetounitedespiterepeatedurgings by their elite sponsors? Answers to these questions,importantin themselves,also promise to reveal how the structures of the regimeand society generated such a large and distinctive mass movement—somethingthatMaoandhisfollowersevidentlyfailedtounderstand.Many have sought to explain the features of the red guard movementby referring to the character of Mao-era social and political institutions.Some claim that the intense political indoctrination of China's youth intothecultofMaoand thedoctrinesofclassstrugglecreateddogmaticmen-talities of unquestioning loyalty that fueled the violence and intoleranceof mobilized students.1 Others argue that the Chinese political systemenclosed citizens in social institutions where they were closely monitored,labeledpolitically in ways that affected their welfare and futures,and periodically subjected to stressful mass campaigns that left aggrieved victimsin their wake—circumstances that contributed to the subsequent tumult.2Still others emphasize the evident passion and emotion of the student ac-tivists, especially the devotion to Chairman Mao that was such a strikingfeature of red guard rhetoric, doctrine, and artistic expression.3These arguments bear directly on questions about the political mental-ities of red guards and their propensity for violence. However, they applyequallytobothsidesoftheconflictanddonotdifferentiatetheviewsandaims of the contending groups. Arguments that refer to general socialconditions or to mentalities and beliefs presumably shared by all red guardsdo not help us explain what turned students against one another.4 To ex-plainfactionaldivisions,weneedtounderstandwhatissuesdividedstu-dents and why they joined one faction or another. This requires an evencloser look at the social and political circumstances of the Mao era.The mass movements of the period revealed much that previously hadbeenunknown about thepolitical andsocial inequalities of Mao-eraChina, and this informationlent a great deal of surface plausibility to social interpretations of factions. It appeared that factions could be distin-guished as either “conservative”or“radical"on the basis of their orien-tationtothe status quo.Aconservative orientation wouldlogicallyappeal topeopletiedtothepolitical establishmentandotherwisefavoredby the regime. A more radical orientation would appeal to groups less fa-AnIntroduction

+vored.Althoughtheevidencewasoftencircumstantialatbest,anddoc-umentation was scarce,it seemed obvious that factional conflict wassomehow rooted in the social inequalities of postrevolutionChina,which pitted those with vested interests in the status quo against thosewhosoughtto changeit.6The red guard movement, of course, did not emerge spontaneously. Itwas initiated and encouraged by China's highest political authorities. Thedecision to mobilize popular attacks on the structures of party and statewas Mao Zedong's unique reaction to political frustrations that hadgrown out of the failures of his Great Leap Forward of 1958-1960 andthe subsequent Sino-Soviet split. By the mid-1960s Mao had declared theSoviet Union a “revisionist” regime that was on the road back to capital-ism.NikitaKhrushchevhadrelaxedtheSovietUnion'sconfrontationalstance toward the United States and spoke openly about peaceful coex-istence.Indeclaring theendof arbitrarycampaignsof repression,Khrushchev announced that there were no antagonistic class strugglesunder socialism, and that the mass persecutions of the Stalin years, justi-fied as a search for hidden enemies of the revolution, were a tragic devi-ation in the history of socialism.Henceforth the superiority of socialismwouldbedemonstratedthroughpeacefulevolution:theabilitytostimu-late economic development and enhance popular welfare by employingthe most advanced scientific methods of management and organization.DuringtheprecedingdecadeMaohadtakenChinainaverydifferentdirection, and the growing gap between his policies and rhetoric andthoseof theSovietUnionwas asourceofincreasingtension and,forMaodefeat and frustration. Against the resistance of other Chinese leaders, hehadforced throughhisHundred Flowerspolicy thatencouraged opencriticism of the party's shortcomings in early 1957.When the criticismsgathered force and students and workers began to organize protests, helashed back with an anti-rightist campaign that ruined the lives of hun-dreds of thousands of victims,many of them educated party members,with punishments that ranged from labor camps to ruined careers.8ImmediatelyafterwardMaolaunchedhisGreatLeapForward,amas-sive mobilization campaign that promised vast increases in output simplybyworkingfaster,puttinginlongerhours,andcastingasideconven-tional methods of cropping and industrial production. Instead, agricul-ture and industry collapsed,and the crisis deepened into one of thelargest famines in Chinese history, during which 20 to 30 million peopledied. Industry was thrown into a depression that lasted until 1963.9

TheBeijingRedGuardsMao backed down and turned the administration of the country overto others,but only after unleashing a second anti-rightist campaign thattargetedthosewhohadexpressedcriticismoftheGreatLeapForward.Rural communes were scaled back, and in many regions collective agri-culturewasabandoned;formsofmanagementpreviouslydenouncedas"bourgeois”were restored; and bridges were rebuilt to the educated eliteboth within and outside the party with a thaw in literature and arts and amore respectful stance toward experts.10Mao soon began to insist once again on the pervasiveness of class strug-gle,the need tobe vigilant against ideologicalbacksliding, and a spirit ofmilitantconfrontationofenemiesathomeandimperialismabroad.The1964 ouster of his nemesis Khrushchev may have reminded him—as hadKhrushchev'searlierdenunciationofStalin—thathisabilitytoshapehiscountry'sfuturecoursewaslimited.Maoalsosensedthatmanyofhiscolleagues did not share his vision of ceaseless political struggle and wereinwardlyattractedtomanyfeaturesofthemoretechnocraticSovietmodel. Khrushchev's colleagues, after all, removed him from power forblundering and erratic leadership in carrying out what they termed his"harebrained schemes"—a charge that applied to Mao with more tragicforce.Mao drew around himself a small group of trusted loyalists whowould help him direct a rolling series of purges and mass mobilizations.He moved with indirection and stealth to place loyalists in key positionsof power as he laid plans for an unprecedented mass movement thatwould shake the regime to its foundations.11Mao's actions were highly unusual, but his impulses were actually areturntosomeofthecorethemesofStalinismduringitsprebureaucratic“"revolutionary” phase from 1927 to 1934.12 Mao, however, did not sim-ply order the internal security services to purge the leadership and carryout mass arrests. He had in mind something much bigger, more disruptive,and potentially much more enduring. He intended to initiate a populistpurge—a mass movement in which the people themselves would identify,criticize, drag out, and punish those whose actions and words had be-trayed therevolutionand“MaoZedong thought."ThisrebellionwouldshockChina's officialdomfrom top tobottom,and the chastened survivorswould presumably conduct themselves differently in the future. Ordinarycitizens, especially China's educated youth, would gain revolutionary ex-perience that would ensure commitment to Maoist ideals for anothergeneration. This mass movement—or more precisely an uncoordinated andviolent array ofdisparatemovements-eventually spread to theentire

TheProblemofFactionsThe most widely accepted explanation of the factionaldivisions thatplagued the red guard movement is that they expressed the social and politicalinequalities of Mao-era China.This ideahas two essentialfeatures.The first is that factions expressed different orientations toward the sta-tusquo.Ononeside,aconservativefactionofferedarelativelymoderatecritique of the status quo and, reluctant to attack the highest organs ofpolitical power, emphasized positive aspects of the regime and its accom-plishmentsandevendefendedincumbentofficialsfromextreme accusa-tionsandviolenttreatment.Opposingtheseconservatives,accordingtothis view,was a radical faction that was much more critical of the statusquo, emphasized the regime's failure to live up to revolutionary ideals,and launched daring attacks on the highest organs of power. In otherwords, factions expressed different orientations toward the status quo,and for this reason they were unable to make common cause.13Why did these different political viewpoints arise? The second part ofthe explanation is essential: factions pursued the opposing interests ofdifferent social groups. Conservative and radical factions represented in-dividuals from different social backgrounds. The varied interests of massconstituencies,in turn,explainboth the factional divisions themselvesandtheintensityoftheirconflict.Surelysuchintenseconflictcouldnotspringfromnowhere;fundamentalsocialandeconomicinterestsmusthavebeeninvolved.Conservativefactions,according tothis view,ex-pressed the interests of those who were closely tied to the CommunistParty and who enjoyed better living standards and future prospects. Rad-ical factions,on the other hand,expressed the interests of those whosetiestopowerstructureswereweakerorwhosepositionandfutureprospects were less bright. In short, factions expressed the interests ofdifferent social constituencies, even though group interests were sub-merged in a Maoist rhetoric that masked self-interested aims.By sud-denly immobilizing a well-organized and repressive political regime,it seemed,the Cultural Revolution inadvertently provided a political

TheBeijingRedGuardsopportunity for these underlying social conflicts to find organized expression.14One of the fascinating features of the Cultural Revolution was the wayin which it exposed political and social inequalities and their attendantdissatisfactions. Temporary and contract workers protested their exclu-sion from secure state-sector jobs.15 Urban youths sent to the countrysideafter failing university entrance exams returned to the cities to demandurbanresidence.16Demobilizedsoldiersassignedtoremotestatefarmsinstead of to the urban jobs they expected formed brigades of skilledfighters to protest their plight.17 These groups all lodged complaints thatdistinguished their interests from the interests of those who were morefavored.The Cultural Revolution also exposed divisions among students. High-school red guards openly debated the relevance of family political her-itage as a qualificationfor leadership of the red guards.The debate re-vealeddimensionsofpoliticallifethatseemeddirectlyrelevanttostudent factions—powerfully expressed in a famous Beijing tract that de-nounced the entire system of political discrimination based on familyheritage.18 Certain red guards proclaimed that the movement should re-cruitmembersprimarilyfromproletarianhouseholds,andthatleader-ship rightfully belonged to the offspring of revolutionary veterans fromthe party and army. These red guards typically scorned “reactionary”households (capitalists,landlords,and Nationalists) and were reluctantto accept students from these families as full partners in the movement.This stance was strenuously opposed by students from other backgrounds,especially the offspring oftheformer professional and middle classes whowereheavily represented in universities and academic high schools.Someargue that this was the decisive issue in defining high-school red guardfactions, and that students from“red”and especially“revolutionary”families were much morelikely to join conservative factions than studentsfromotherbackgrounds.19The debate about class origin revealed the importance of political statusandactivismintheallocationofeducationalandcareeropportunities.Competition for admission to universities and thebesthigh schools wasintense: a combination of standardized test scores,political evaluations,and judgments about family political loyalty decided students’futures.Students from “revolutionary” and “proletarian” households were to beshown favoritism, while students from “reactionary” households were pe-nalized.The debate about class origin echoed an explicit party policy. The

AnIntroductionregime classifiedhouseholds according to the occupation andpoliticalaffiliationofthemaleheadofthehouseholdatthetimetheregimewasestablished. It openly favored two types of “red" households: those classi-fied as“revolutionary”(Communist Party member,Red Army soldier,orrevolutionary martyr) and “proletarian” (manual wage earner, poor andlower-middle peasants). These labels were inherited through the malelineandinfluencededucationalattainmentandrecruitmentintotheparty and leadershippositions.20Studentshadtodecidehowtoallocatetheirtimebetweenthepursuitof academic excellence and the compilation of a strong record as a polit-ical activist.21 Classroom counselors andpolitical instructors regularlyplacedformalevaluationsinpoliticaldossiersthatwerekeptoneverystudentandthatwouldfollowthemthroughouttheircareers.Arecordofactiveparticipationin theCommunistYouthLeague couldenhance one'seducational opportunities and improve one's job assignment at the com-pletion of schooling. Students who became classroom or youth leagueleaders, known as “student cadres,”and eventually (in universities) partymembers were shown the strongest preference. China's schools bred ahighly competitive environment in which politics played a singularly im.portantrole.These considerations inspired a strong scholarly consensus. Whetherdefined byfamilybackground or political affiliations,the identity of stu-dentsbefore the Cultural Revolution determined theirinterests and polit-ical orientations once the movement began.22 As one summary of thisconsensus described the university red guards, the “conservative”factionwas composed mainlyofpeoplewho,due totheirfamilybackground,be-longed to the privileged strata of Chinese society.

They saw in it an unexpected opportunity to express their re-sentment against a social order which they considered repressive.23

NetworkMobilization?InSearchofanExplanationI began research for this book convinced of the accuracy of this interpre-tation.The onlyquestioninmymindwas whichversionbestfit theevi-dence for the red guards of Beijing. I chose Beijing because of the un-usualprominenceofitsstudentmovementandtheremarkablelackofabook-length study of the subject in any language.24 The capital's popula-tion of university students was more than twice as large as that of anyother Chinese city, and as a consequence they played an unusually im-portant and highly visible role. Beijing's students were the first to mobi-lize, their activities were widely publicized as a nationwide model, andthey exercised considerable influence over the movement as it spread na-tionwide.Equally important is a rich documentary record that makes Beijing'sstudent movement highly accessible for research. Several decades ago,when documentary sources were largely unavailable, researchers reliedprimarily on the oral reminiscences of former red guards who managedtomigratetoHongKong.As a result,theearly studiesfocused on thenearby city of Guangzhou (Canton) and the experiences of the high-schoolstudents who dominated its student population. In the post-Mao era doc-umentary sources graduallybecame more widely accessible,andby thelate 1990s a remarkable array of new sources was at hand: near-completeruns of factional newspapers from dozens of universities, collections ofwall posters,detailed chronicles of events written by students at the time,and transcripts of hundreds of speeches by officials at red guard rallies orin private meetings with students.25 By far the largest of these collectionsare from the nation's capital.When I began my research, the only question in my mind was whichversion of a social interpretation was valid.The primary candidate waspolitical status as defined by family heritage and enforced by the regime'spolicy of household political labels. Past research on high-school redguards seemed to show that this was the crucial characteristic that de-fined the interest of students and divided them into opposing red guardfactions.

AnIntroductionBut a different idea appealed to me. My previous research on Chineseindustryin theMaoera convincedme that authorityinfactorieswas exercised through a vertical hierarchy of social ties that linked the party or-ganization to a network of political loyalists among ordinary employees.26Loyalfollowerswere rewardedpreferentially and enjoyedtheprospectof subsequent promotion. These networks tied together individuals ofdifferentrank andsocialstatus andcreatedsharedintereststhatencour-aged mutual support and loyalty. My past research suggested that political cleavages among workers were created along these network lines—very few factory workers were from“revolutionary”households,andalmost all of them came from “red" proletarian families.27 The categoriescreatedbyhouseholdpoliticallabelshadlittlerelevanceontheshopfloorMuch more salient were divisions between workers who had joined theparty or who actively did its bidding and those who avoided these in-volvements.In China's universities, I suspected, the party's networks were probablycomposed of individuals from a variety of“red,”“ordinary,” and in somecaseseven“reactionary”familyheritage.Studentsfrom“revolutionaryhouseholds,after all,were a tiny minority of China's population—onlysome 4 percent of urban residents.28 They were overrepresented on univer-sity campuses, but even if they were highly favored by party authorities,therewere toofewof them tofullypopulateitsnetworks ofparty membersand loyal political activists.29 The party's networks in universities musthave incorporated people from a variety of family backgrounds, and as aconsequence these network ties, not status categories defined by familyheritage, should have provided the social cleavages that generated factions.I began with this idea: conservative factions grew out of networks ofparty members and political activists who instinctively defended theirparty organization from attack. A radical faction, based heavily on thosepreviously excluded from these networks, led the attacks on universityofficials; the party's loyal, conservative followers fought back.30 Redguard factions, soI thought, were probably a result of efforts by individ-uals tied to party networks to defend their vested interests in the preser-vationofthestatusquo.

order.Iwanted tounderstand whenfactionalcleavages first appearedandIwaslookingforevidenceaboutwhenandhowfactionalidentitiesformed. The attention to chronology unexpectedly revealed how studentpolitical allegiances and thefactional identities depended on events thattookplaceinschoolsduringthefirsttwomonthsoftheCulturalRevo-lution,when outside delegations of party officials known as“work teams”directed purges and mobilized students.Given my preconceptions, it was remarkable how different the earlypolitics of the Cultural Revolution looked as described in the writings andspeeches of participants at the time the events occurred.31 Very quickly Iwas forced to abandon the idea that members of party networks mobi-lized to defend them from attack. This expectation, I discovered, dependedon a deeper assumption of whichI was not initially conscious—that thework teams sent into schools during June and July tried to limit the at-tacks of militant students and preserve the party organization. Publishedscholarship had long portrayed the work teams as a bulwark of partyauthorityintheuniversities:“Theirmissionwas tobring thesituationunder control and tocarry out the Cultural Revolution in an orderlyman-ner.Theytendedtoactinmuch thesameway as thePartycommitteestheyhad come to rescue, and suppressed students who had opposed these com-mittees."32 In line with this consensus, I had assumed that work teamsencouraged party loyalists to mobilize in defense of their party organiza-tion. To my surprise, I found that this was very rare in Beijing. Powerstructuresquicklydisintegrated.This was the first important assumption to fall. When I turned to thequestion of how work teams did divide students against one another, Ifound that the issues rarely involved an assessment of the status quo orone's positionwithinit.Instead,the issuesweremore ambiguous and con-cernedtheactionsoftheworkteamitself.Howmuchauthorityshouldworkteamsexerciseover students?Did theyhavetherighttopreventvio-lent struggle sessions? Who controlled the prisoners? Had the work teamstargetedtherightschoolofficials?Hadtheyoverreactedinpunishingdefi-antstudents?The controversies that rockedschools during this periodwerenot about the status quo at all, but about the actions of the work teams.Yet another assumption tofall was theidea thatred guardfactions haddifferent views about the status quo.The red guards burst forth suddenlyonuniversitycampusesinAugust1966,immediatelyafterthewithdrawalof work teams. The issues that divided them, however, concerned the re-cent actions of the work teams rather than the status quo.A majority ofAnIntroduction

11studentmilitantshadavoidedconflictwithworkteamsandwereleftinchargeofschools.Aminoritywhohadclashedwiththeworkteamsbecame the targets of a denunciation campaign.The majority wanted tocontinue the Cultural Revolution under student leadership,treating thework teams as a dead issue—a regrettable error of higher-level officialsthatshould nowbeset aside.Theminoritydemandedthattheworkteamsbe brought back to the schools to confess their errors and withdraw thecharges against their student opponents, and they were willing to marchtogovernmentoffices todemand thatincriminatingmaterialsberemovedfromtheirpoliticalfilesandthattheworkteamsbesurrendered.Thesedifferent political orientations were based on the events of June and Julyand their impact on the students involved.Who were the students who opposed the work teams and ended up inthis more militant minority? Were they marginal to party networks andtherefore more likely to challenge authority?33 If so,prior network tiesmight still have defined factional cleavages. The evidence, however,pointed elsewhere. The very same party members and political activistswhom I expected to defend party hierarchies and obey the work teams infactledthemilitantminority.Howdidsomanyofthemenduponthewrong side,according to my prior reasoning? Most work teams shat-tered existing hierarchies and sanctioned attacks on officials, immobiliz-ing party networks and forcing those connected to them to react. Partymembers and political activists were expected to take a stand and wereunder pressure to react, and quickly. When a school's top officials weredenounced and removed from office, many of their loyal followers con-cluded that they might be found guilty by association, and they hastenedtorepudiateratherthandefendtheirerstwhileleaders.However,workteams did not alwaysmake clear atfirstwhatkinds ofbehavior they expected or what their verdict on the party organizationwould be.

The cleavage between Beijing's “majority” and “minority” factionsevolved by the fall of 1966 into a conflict between reputed conservativesand rebels.The more radical stance of the rebels,however,did not growout of their prior exclusion from power and privilege.

TheGenesisofFactionalIdentitiesThe explanation that fits the evidence differs from the group and networkexplanations that served as my starting point in one crucial respect. Thepolitical orientations and interests of movement activists were not givenby their prior positions,whether these are conceived as common socialstatusornetworkrelationships.TheCulturalRevolutiondidnotactivatepreexisting interests and orientations simply by removing constraintsand creating a political opportunity for existing groups to act. Prior iden-titieswerenotrelevanttothechoicesstudentsfacedattheoutsetoftheCultural Revolution. The analysis of prior, fixed group interests and alle-giances in the context of shifting political opportunities would misrepre-sentwhattheBeijingredguardmovementwasabout.The alternative explanation is based on close attention to evidence aboutthe formation and subsequent evolution of factions within schools. Theshift from stable and repressive institutions to a situation where they areunder challenge is not smooth or unproblematic. The process of institu-tional collapse is crucial. In China's schools during the summer of 1966,the institutions that stabilized expectations about authority and linkedone's status and position to politicalresponses werebreaking down

AnIntroductionrapidly in noveland unpredictable ways.Those closely tied to powerstructures were pressured to take a stand. To take a stand put one in aposition of opposition to those who took a different stand. Choice in thisnovel and ambiguous situation prevented those who were tied to powerstructures from acting in concert. The signals about expected behavior,very clear in stable circumstances,were suddenly scrambled. This di-vided those previously loyal to authority figures against one another in aconflict that generated new identities and urgent new interests. A personwho could not successfully defend his or her earlier choice would suffer asharp loss of status and bear the stigma of having committed a politicalerror.Another way of stating the argument is that factional identities and thecommon interests that define them are the product of political interac-tions rooted in specific contexts whose properties must be researched, notsimply assumed. Individual decisions—to join factions, to oppose or sup-port a work team—are not the product of prior socialization or social tiesbutareactivelyshapedbypoliticalencounters.Thefocusisontheinter-actions that generate choices and outcomes, not the prior statuses of indi-viduals or their preexisting social and political ties. These processes de-termine when prior socialstatuses or network tiesare activated inaconflict, and when they are not. This is the central puzzle of this book.This is not, however, the central puzzle of contemporary political soci-ology,especially the branch that specializes in the study of social move-ments andcontentiouspolitics.For severaldecadesthatfieldhasbeenpreoccupiedwiththeproblem ofmobilization,whichtreats theidentitiesand motives of political groups as given. The central puzzle is why andhow groups that have established identities and long-standing grievancesare able to find common cause, organize, mobilize resources, exploit po-litical opportunities, and achieve a collectively valued outcome.35The pronounced emphasis on the problem of mobilization originatedduring the 1970s in the widespread recognition that societies with themost aggrieved populations are by no means the ones that are most likelyto generate the largest political movements or the mostfrequent protestevents.Why not?First,the relevant populations may nothave the capac-ity to organize—they may lack means of communication,or they maylack regular contact with one another, or they may lack social solidaritybecause ofweak community structure or ethnic and other status differ-ences. Second, even if they have the capacity to organize, they may lackthe resources or resourcefulness to be effective—leadership skills, strategy,

TheBeijingRedGuards14

supplies of material, equipment, or funds. Third, even with a strong or-ganizational capacity, ample resources,and astute strategy,a movementmay still be stymied by an inhospitable political opportunity structure—allies or coalition partners in other social groups maybe absent at crucialpoints in time, or the authorities may be highly unified and have well-organized and effective strategies of repression.Some scholars have dis-sented from the analysis of organization and political opportunity andhavesoughttoemphasizethecultural,symbolic,moral,andcharismaticdimensions of popular mobilization by providing rich descriptions of themeanings that political actors attribute to their actions.36 Even these at-tempts toforge a new approach remainfocused on the problem ofmobilization.37However compelling the problem of mobilization is in many historicalcircumstances, it is not the enduring puzzle about China's red guards. Allthe structural and subjective circumstances essential for political mobi-lization were suddenly created for the student movement in 1966. Afterall, the movement was instigated at the apex of the political system and fa-cilitated from the beginning by access to the mass media, funding, meansof transportation and communication, and the support and advice of apowerful leadership faction. The nation's supreme leader openly supportedit.Themassmediacelebratedthestudentrebels,developedanelaboratemoral and political rationale for their actions, and applauded their activ-ities.Classes were canceled along with entrance exams and job assign-ments. Dormitories were kept open, and meal services continued into thesummer months and beyond.The security agencies and armed forceswere ordered to support student radicals and not to interfere.38 The puz-zle is not how students mobilized but why they were so bitterly divided.This does not mean that thefamiliar analysis of organization and po-litical opportunity is of little use in understanding red guard factions. Itis essential in understanding why factional divisions hardened after theyfirst appeared and why they evolved the way that they did. Student fac-tions responded to what they perceived as political opportunities as re-vealed by the mass media and Maoist officials at crucial points in theevolutionofthemovement.Throughoutthetwoyearsofthemovementthese signals were frequently ambiguous and contradictory,and at keypoints they were reversed without warning.These ambiguous and shift-ingsignals exacerbated divisions among students and deepened theirmu-tualantagonisms.TheevolutionofBeijing'sredguardfactionswastheAnIntroduction

15product ofintensive andrepeated interactionsbetween certainmembersof China's political elite and the leaders of the student movement.The primary elite actors in this story were the members of a committeenear the apex of national power that Mao appointed to help direct thestudent rebellion and ensure its growth and success.As they did so,theyfrequently shifted course and often worked at cross-purposes, influenc-ing the course of the movement in both intended and unintended ways.This committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group (CCRG),as-sumed increasing power in the course of the rebellion and played a keyrole in shaping Beijing's red guard factions.

EliteSponsorship:TheCentralCulturalRevolutionGroupFormed on May 28, 1966, at the Politburo meetings where the first waveof leadership purges was formalized, the Central Cultural RevolutionGroup initially played an informal, behind-the-scenes role in stimulatingthe insurgency. Its power grew steadily as China's top leadership wasdecimated in purges, and by February 1967 it replaced the Politburo andtheCentralCommitteeSecretariatanddevelopedalargebureaucracyofits own.39 The CCRG had nationwide concerns, but because it was verydeeply involved in the capital's student movement, it had an enormousinfluenceinBeijing.Only a few of the members of this committee were ranking membersof China's top leadership,and none of them were responsible for themanagement of the economy or the administration of the public sector.Virtually all of them were involved in propaganda, security work, andMarxist-Leninist ideology and were past advocates of Mao's more radi-calinitiatives.The twomostimportant memberswereKang Sheng and Jiang Qing.Kang was the group's “advisor,”but he was deeply involved in its activi-ties.Kang spent four years in the Soviet Union during the height ofStalin's Great Purges, and this experience honed his interests in counter-intelligence and security work.4° In the wartime base area of Yan'an inthe early 1940s, he led the party's first traumatic campaign to root out al-leged traitors and fortifyloyalty toMao Zedong.41 In the early1960sMao brought Kang into his effort to fight revisionism and ideologicalbacksliding and put him in charge of a Central Committee departmentthat developed the polemics against the Soviet Union.Kang personally

Jiang played norole in party politics until the early 1960s, when she became active in thefields of drama and the arts, promoting works with proper revolutionarycontent. She served as Mao's personal emissary in arranging publicationof critical attacks on literary figures that presaged the launching of theCultural Revolution.43 Initially Jiang was named vice-chairman of theCCRG,butsheeffectivelytookovercontrolfromthenominalchairmanChen Boda in September 1966.44Chen Boda,a specialist in propaganda and Marxism-Leninism,wasvice-head of the party's Propaganda Department and editor of the theo-retical journal Red Flag. As Mao's political secretary in Yan'an, he playeda key role in developing the Mao cult and Mao Zedong Thought. He andKang Sheng spearheaded the Yan'an rectification campaign in 1942-1943 that targeted errant intellectuals and alleged traitors in the party.45Red Flag, founded under his editorship in 1958, was the official mouth-pieceofMao'spoliticallineandtheauthoritativevoiceoftheCCRGduring the Cultural Revolution.46The remaining members were younger propaganda officials. ZhangChunqiao, 49, head of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Bureau, wasa vice-chairman. He had earlier supported the publication of political at-tacks on authors and literary figures that led directly to the Cultural Rev-olution.47 Several others held editorial posts under Chen Boda at RedFlag.Qi Benyu,35,was a director of the History Editorial Group andbecame Mao's secretary in May 1966.48 Wang Li, 45, had previouslyworked underKang Sheng as vice-head of the Chinese CommunistParty(CCP) International Liaison Department, where he had authored ideo-logical polemics against the Soviet Union.49 Guan Feng, 46, had workedhis way up through the CCP Political Research Office, where he had ex-tensive dealings with Chen Boda and Kang Sheng and briefly edited aninternal theoretical bulletin read by Mao.50 Mu Xin, 47, was editor-in-chief of the party's newspaper for intellectual affairs, Guangming ribao(Enlightenment Daily).s1 The younger members of the CCRG played anactiveroleasliaisonswiththestudentradicals.The CCRG had little independent authority, and almost all its mem-bers were marginal political figures who depended entirely on Mao'sAnIntroduction

17backing. They often had to guess Mao's ambiguous and frequently shift-ing views.In addition,at crucial points members worked at cross-purposes and openly disagreed. Moreover, the membership of the com-mittee shifted as individuals were purged after being judged insufficientlyradical or were blamed for excesses that earned Mao's disapproval.Thefirst major change occurred in August 1966,when the regional secre-taries charged with coordinating the work teams were removed in dis-grace. The second major change occurred at the end of 1966 when sev-eral more were purged for resisting the escalation of the movement (TaoZhu, Wang Renzhong, and Liu Zhijian). Wang Li, Guan Feng, and QiBenyu, strong advocates of radical students as the movement escalated,wereblamedinlate1967fortheviolencethatresultedwhenmassfactions were armed. Remarkably, by February 1968 only five of the originalnineteenmembers and advisors of the CCRGsurvived(seeTable 1.1).The CCRG was deeply involved in the Beijing student movement fromstarttofinish.Membersmetconstantlywithstudentleadersandspokeregularly at large rallies and small group meetings. Many of these ses-sions were recorded, transcribed, and published in student newspapers.Staff departments assisted the committee and grew in size as the CulturalRevolution proceeded. As its power grew with the decimation of the na-tional bureaucracy, other officials regularly attended CCRG meetings ina nonvotingcapacity.Reflectingthesteady authoritariandriftoftheCul-tural Revolution, many of these participants had military and securityposts.52 Among those who served on the CCRG staff were Cao Yi'ou,KangSheng'swife,whowasfor aperiodtheheadof thestaffoffice,andLin Jie, a staff editor at Red Flag who played an active and visible role asaliaisonwithrebelstudents.AttheoutsetoftheCulturalRevolutiontheCCRG set up offices in the state guesthouse compound at Diaoyutai, onthe western edge of Beijing near the Haidian university district.53 TheCCRG also built an intelligence network on the campuses. Reporters weretransferredfrom theNewChinaNewsAgencyand LiberationArmyDaily and stationed in universities, reporting daily on events and trendsin the movement. In many cases student rebels viewed the reporters as di-rect channels to the top leadership and invited them to participate in theirleadershipmeetings.54The CCRG enacted the political initiatives of Mao Zedong,whoworkedbehind thescenesthroughhisprovenloyalists.Itranthemove-ment on Mao's behalf, encouraged, advised, and steered students in onedirection or another,and often selected targets for attack.The CCRG

StudentsandtheRegimeThe students who took part in Beijing's Cultural Revolution were at theapex of a steep educational pyramid,a select elite who could expect toenjoyfavorableplacementaftercompletingtheirschooling.In1965Chinahad apopulationof 750million,but only674,430 students wereenrolledin434institutionsofhighereducation.Thecompetitiontoreach university was intense, and the odds of advancement to the topwere very small.Of the 32.9 million students who entered primaryschool in 1965, only 9 percent could expect to enter junior high school.Only 15 percent of these junior high entrants,in turn,could expect tograduate and enter high school. Academic high school was already a rar-efied atmosphere,but these graduates alsofaced steepodds:only36per-cent would make it to university. Overall, the odds of attending an aca-demic high school for a student entering primary school in 1965 were1.3 percent, and the odds of attending university less than 0.5 percent.55Beijing had an unusually large concentration of university students. Inaddition to the largest and most prestigious liberal arts (Beijing Univer-sity), science and engineering (Qinghua University), and teachers’ colleges(BeijingNormalUniversity),mostofthemorethanfortynationalmin-istries and commissions operated university campuses devoted to trainingtheir future personnel.The largest of these were theBeijing Geology In-stitute(Ministry ofGeology),theBeijingAeronauticsInstitute(NationalDefense Science and Technology Commission), the Beijing Steel Institute(Ministry of Metallurgy), and the Beijing Mining Institute (Ministry ofCoal). These schools were lodged in a bureaucratic hierarchy that tiedthemtothesystemofnationalministries.Becauseofthisconcentratedbu-reaucratic presence, the capital's student population was remarkably top-heavy: there were 111,0o0 university students, one-sixth of the nationaltotal and double the number of local high-school students.56High-school students in Beijing's Western, Eastern, and Haidian dis-tricts were also an elite group, but of a different variety. The universities

The children of China’s political elite were heav-ilyoverrepresentedintheseschools,asweretheoffspringofeducatedprofessionals and office staff.57This was a highly closed system. All schools were government run andcontrolled by Communist Party committees and branches. There was vir-tuallynooptiontostudyabroad:Chinahadonly454universitystudentsoutside its borders in 1965.58 Graduates were given mandatory job assign-ments by government agencies in consultation with school authorities.Assignmentswereheavilyinfluencedbystudents’specializationandgradesand alsobyhousehold political label and individuals’records ofpoliticalactivism asrecorded in their all-importantpolitical dossiers.Apoliticalerror in this system could have costly and irreversible consequences forone's future, for the simple reason that behavior was carefully monitored,recordswerekept,andtherewasnoexitfromthesystem.

TheOrganizedSetting:SchoolPowerStructuresThe national political hierarchy extended into the schools.

Academic departments divided eachyear's incoming students into numbered “classrooms”(banji) of sometwenty-five students. Each classroom was assigned a “classroom coun-selor”(ban zhuren),an instructor considered politically reliable by theparty branch.Each classroom had its own Communist Youth Leaguebranch and selected its own youth league and classroom officers.Thesewere “student cadres,” destined eventually to join the party. Rates of stu-dent party membership ranged from 5 to 20 percent in the universities(see Table 1.3). At Qinghua, where there were 1,390 students in the party,twoadditional“student cadres”in eachof the 425classrooms wouldimply an additional 850 student leaders.The network therefore connectedsome2,200studentstothepartyorganization.These arrangements explain why so many students mobilized so rap-idly at the outset of the Cultural Revolution.Mao's call to criticize powerholders reverberated through a hierarchy that directly linked large num-bers of politically active students to the regime. Students were alreadyformed into small groups with elected leaders accustomed to respondingtoregime-sponsoredactivities.Studentswhowerecloselyconnectedtoparty leaders had a propensity for political activism and vested interestsin their positions.

It was important to display the proper level ofloyalty and activism,but it was even more important not to commit a se-rious political error, because this could negate years of effort in both ac-ademics andpolitics.In normal times these networks operated with a great deal of disci-pline.We should not overestimate their resilience,however, because theircohesion depended heavily on undivided authority and clear signals fromthe top. If authority was divided or uncertain, and the signals becamescrambled, the cohesion of the network was lost, especially if the net-work itself was under attack. Ordinary party members, student cadres,and political activists had a propensity to respond to political campaigns,and they also faced considerable pressure, given their status, to be thefirst to take a stand. It was this feature of the political networks that madethem so fragile when external work teams of ranking party officials en-tered the schools and initiated the purges of the Cultural Revolution.

OverviewoftheAnalysisEach chapter explores a distinct dimension of the origins and evolutionof red guard politics in Beijing. I try to achieve a balance between a focus24

TheBeijingRedGuardson central questions aboutfactionalpolitics and a narrative account of adramatic,complex,and poorly understood story. The student rebellionemerged suddenly and developed rapidly at the beginning of June 1966.OnMay25,sevendissidentpartymembersfromBeijingUniversity'sPhi-losophy Department put up a wall poster denouncing the university's pres-ident as an ally of municipal party officials who had recently been purged.Within days the poster was reprinted in the national newspaper, People'sDaily, and lavished with praise; the university's president and two othersnamed in the wall poster were removed from their posts, and a workteam was sent to take control of the university and carry out a purge of itsadministration. As large numbers of individuals at other schools launchedsimilaraccusationsagainsttheirownleaders,dozensmoreworkteamstook over from collapsing school administrations throughout the city.InChapter2Iexaminehowworkteamsactuallybehavedtowardthepower structures of the universities. How did they treat top school offi-cials and the rest of the party organization? Did they try to blunt at-tacks on the officials, or did they encourage them? Did they remove of-ficials from power,or did they let them keep their posts?The answersto these questions will tell us what political choices actually faced stu-dent activists.A reconstruction of work-team actions in half of Beijing'suniversitiesreveals aconfusingarrayofwork-teamactions,whichvar-ied widely across schools and often shifted abruptly, showing that workteams were often unsure how to proceed. These narratives illustratethe remarkable ambiguity and unpredictability of the political environ-ment withinwhich student activists hadto take a standduringJuneandJuly1966.Chapter3describeshowtheworkteamssplituniversitypowerstruc-turesintowarringfactions,withafocus ontheissuesthatbredconflictbetweenworkteams andmilitantstudents.Onlyinrare andfleetingcir-cumstancesweretheissuesofcontention aboutattacksontheincumbentpower structure—a question that might distinguish“conservative”from“radical" political orientations.

25a profile similar to that of the students who followed the work teamsilead.Chapter 4 examines the divisions among university red guards that ap-peared in early August,immediately after the work teams’withdrawal.The factional struggle focused on the events of June and July and theirconsequences for the students involved.A vocal minority, led by thosewho had been punished by the work teams, demanded a campaign toforce them to retract their charges. This“minority”faction's strategy un-dercut the authority of thestudentswhohad cooperatedwith theworkteams and assumed control of the schools after they left. The majorityfaction, in turn, defended its earlier actions, minimized the work-teamissue,andfoughtbackagainsttheminority's challenge.This conflictbe-tween“minority”and“majority”factionswas actuallyaboutworkteams,not the political status quo. The growing rebelliousness of the minorityfaction was rooted in grievances based on their clash with the work teams,not in a more critical stance toward the nation's political institutions.Chapter5turnstoeventsintheelitehighschoolsoftheWestern,Eastern, and Haidian districts,which unfolded very differently than in uni-versities and created different political cleavages. In the high schoolsopposition to work teams was led by politically active students from“revolutionary” family heritage, often the children of high officials. Theseearly high-school militants were not left with the grievances of the uni-versity“minority”faction.Instead,Mao and the CCRG made them na-tionalcelebrities,andtheyouthleagueofficialswhohadsentworkteamsinto the high schools were immediately purged. There was no split withinhigh schools analogous to the minority-majority split in the universities.Two issues did divide high-school militants: family origin and red guardviolence. These were arguments within the first wave of red guard mili-tants from predominantly “red" households but they did not define clearfactional identities.The students who took a strong stand against redguard violence—and who also took pride in their revolutionary and pro-letarian family origin—formed picket corps to rein in the violence andcruelty displayed by the early red guards and in so doing formed strongties to the State Council apparatus under Premier Zhou Enlai. This stanceput them on a collision course with their erstwhile sponsors on theCCRG.Chapter6exploresthepathfollowedbytheuniversityminorityasitgained CCRG support and became the dominant “rebel” faction.Itachievedthisstatuslargelythroughdaringattacksonnationalministries

that advanced the CCRG's objective of extending purges into higher lev.els of the party apparatus. These sit-ins, demonstrations, and buildinginvasions did not express a more critical attitude toward China's political status quo than that of the minority's rivals in the majority faction.They were a product of the minority faction's attempt to confront theleaders of its work teams, extract confessions and apologies, and removefrom members’ records the negative political verdicts recorded by workteams. It just so happened that work-team leaders and their files werelocatedinnationalministries.TheCCRGintervenedtosupportthemi-nority faction and undermine the university majority and the high-schoolpicket corps, which confronted minority protesters when they attackedgovernment offices and the homes of officials. During this period theCCRG'sroleinrunningthestudentmovementandmanipulatingitsout-comes became highly visible and,to many student militants,a cause ofdissent.Chapter 7 documents the rebellion of the university majority and thehigh-school pickets against their dismissal as “conservatives” by theCCRG. During November 1966 some of these students began a daringwall-poster campaign that offered a coherent critique of the CCRG's ac-tions. They objected to their labeling as “conservatives” and to the in-creasingly heavy-handed manipulation of the student movement. In oneof the clearest examples of rebellion against political authority duringthe Cultural Revolution, they openly challenged the arguments and actionsof theCCRG andridiculedsome ofitsmembers.Astheirsmall move-mentdeveloped,theybegantochargethattheCCRGcontainedanti-party conspirators. Some of the former leaders of the defunct high-schoolpicket corps organized a citywide alliance, Liandong (United Action), todefend their position.This open challenge to theMaoist authorities pro-voked aharshbacklash.Openly violating its earlier prohibition againstthe use of security forces against students, the CCRG ordered a wave ofarrests and unleashed a national propaganda campaign that vilified thedissidents anddistorted their actions andmotivesinways thathaveheav-ilyinfluencedpastscholarship.Thesedissidentsareusuallydescribedasconservativesattemptingtodefend theirprivilegedpositionin the statusquo, but in fact these groups were responding to grievances that origi-nated in the immediately preceding period and paralleled the minorityfaction's earlier grievances against the work teams.Chapter8examines thepuzzlingdisintegrationoftherebel movementin January 1967, soon after the decisive victory over its opponents. Why

AnIntroductiondid the victorious rebel coalition rapidly split into two opposing camps?Intheir earlier attacks on ministriesand commissions,rebels stayedwithin separate bureaucratic hierarchies.Work teams were dispatcheddown these hierarchies to the schools under them, and the pursuit ofworkteamsledrebelsdirectlybackupthishierarchytotheministryorcommission that sent them.When these rebels moved to seize power innational and municipal agencies, however, they crossed into different bu-reaucratichierarchies.Rebelgroupsfromdifferentschoolswhowent tothe same organs ofpower turned quickly from allies into competitors.These competitive rivalries were exacerbated by deep splits that had ear-lier developed among rebelforces in the twolargest and mostimportantcampuses,Beijing and Qinghua universities.The splits at Beida andQinghua served as a wedge to divide rebelforces citywide,as factions indifferent schools aligned themselves with one or another faction at thesetwo large campuses. The resulting split between “Heaven”and “Earth"factions crippled the student movement and frustrated the CCRG untiltheveryend.Chapter 9,finally, explains why it proved impossible for the two fac-tionstounitedespiterepeatedeffortstoforcethemtodoso.After thestudents’inept attempts at power seizures, Mao and the CCRG turned toan authoritarian solution and put the Ministry of Public Security and theBeijingGarrisonCommandincharge.Thispushedstudentsbackintopower struggles on their own campuses, and these struggles became in-creasingly violent and impervious to official mediation as 1967 turnedinto 1968. On almost all campuses two wings of the former rebel move-ment faced off, making extreme political charges against each other thatwere far more severe than the work-team verdicts that had originally in-spiredtherebelfaction.Theideathatstudentscouldunitetoruletheircampuses proved chimerical:antagonisms and mutual suspicion had sodeepenedthatneithersidecouldtrustapoliticalsettlementthatwasnotenforced by a neutral third party. As increasingly violent factional dis-putes developed into open warfare on some campuses in the spring of1968,Mao and the CCRG abandoned all efforts to negotiate a settle-ment and, in obvious disgust, dispatched the armed forces to take overthe campuses, shut down the student movement, and detain recalcitrantstudentrebelsforreeducation.

2THEASSAULTONPOWERSTRUCTURES

WorkTeamsintheUniversitiesThe red guard movement exploded suddenly in August 1966, but onlyafter a two-month period during which university power structures weretorn apart by outside intervention. As public accusations against schoolauthorities spread rapidly across Beijing in early June,work teams ofparty officials were hastily assigned to universities and high schools. Al-most all of them came into conflict with students, teachers, and cadres.After their abrupt withdrawal two monthslater,universities were alreadydivided into two nascent factions—a direct legacy of the work teams'interventions.Aswork teams were withdrawn,Mao Zedong charged them with“sup-pressing the student movement." This was an “error of orientation andline,” allegedly a deliberate effort to shield power holders in the schools.As the purges of the Cultural Revolution escalated, State Chairman LiuShaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, general secretary of the CCP Central Com-mittee, the second- and sixth-ranking members of the national leader-ship, were blamed for employing work teams to obstruct Mao's CulturalRevolution. Red guards echoed these charges, seemingly incensed that thework teams’suppression of the student movement was aneffort to protectpowerholders in theschools.The charge that the work teams “protected power holders” suggesteda link between the behavior of work teams and the divisions among stu-dents. If work teams protected power holders, then student activists whocooperated with them must have had close ties to school power struc-tures and vested interests in their preservation. These included party mem-bers, student cadres, and students from “red"family backgrounds favoredby the party, especially families of officials and party and army veteransfrom the revolutionary era.These individuals had a strong stake in the

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesstatusquoandwouldbealikelysourceof“conservative”studentslesscritical of the status quo, who would tend to support work teams and betheir naturalallies.Students whoclashedwithwork teams,accordingtothisview,hadweakertiestoschoolleadersandthereforefewerinhi-bitions in attacking them.Theywere less likely tobe party members orstudent cadres or from families headed by officeholders or revolutionaryveterans.To many early observers,this logic was compelling because itprovided a direct link between red guard factionalism and the social andpoliticalstructuresofMao'sChina.This analysis assumes that we correctly understand the political con-texts in which students decided whether to support or resist work teams.It hinges on a key factual question: whether work teams actually did trytopreserve schoolpower structures.If they did not,then students couldnotrespondtothemonthebasisoftheirvestedinterestsorlackthereof;their political choices would be different and more complicated.An ex-planation that links status before the Cultural Revolution to political ori-entationduring themovementwould havetobemodified or replaced.InthischapterIdemonstrate thattheworkteams sent touniversitiesdid not consistently seek to preserve school power structures.Many triedbrieflytodosobutabandoned theattemptwithintwoweeks andlaunched devastating attacks that immobilized and split school powerstructures.These actions split students from similar backgrounds intoopposing factions. We therefore need a new explanation for the forma-tion and perpetuation of factional struggle among red guards. But firstwe need to show that the explanation that has seemed so appealing for ageneration does not withstand close scrutiny.

Work-TeamInterventionsThe speed and scale of thebureaucratic effort tosend work teams tohun-dreds of schools and other organizations meant that hastily assembled andpoorly briefed officials were sent into unfamiliar, conflict-ridden territorywith ill-defined missions. Moreover, work teams were sent from a widerange of government agencies,and the rank of the officials who led themalsodiffered.As aresult,workteamsbehavedverydifferently andoftenshifted their strategies, sometimes abruptly.On May 25, 1966, seven instructors of Marxism-Leninism in BeijingUniversity's Philosophy Department, headed by the secretary of the de-partment'sgeneralpartybranch,putupwhatlaterbecameknownasthe

“first wall poster” of the Cultural Revolution. They denounced Lu Pingthe university's president and party secretary; Peng Peiyun, one of thevice-presidents;andSongShuo,thedeputydirectoroftheuniversityde-partment of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, as revisionists com-plicit with the Beijing party officials recently purged for blocking Mao'sinitial efforts to launch his new political campaign. Party members andactivists in the university initially reacted in a predictablefashion—theyralliedaroundtheleadership.However,whenonJune2thewallposterwas printed with editorial praise in the nation's leading newspapers andother mass media, defensive actions by those loyal to the leadership col-lapsedimmediately.1At this point the first work team was dispatched toBeijing University.2The decision was so abrupt that Zhang Chengxian, who led Beijing Uni-versity's work team, was not informed of his assignment until shortly be.fore the 8 p.m. broadcast of the wall poster on June 1. He was quicklybriefed and sent to the campus in advance of the broadcast. He informedthe school's party committee of the decision to suspend it, and shortlyafter midnight he gave a speech to all cadres, party and youth leaguemembers, and student cadres to announce that the work team was takingover.3OnJune2anofficialeditorialcondemnedtheofficialsdenouncedin the wall poster as an “anti-party clique,” and the next day all three werepublicly stripped of their posts and the wall poster's authors were praised.4This had an immediate impact throughout Beijing. As the new munici-pal party secretary Li Xuefeng put it, “After June 1, the situation accel-erated.As soon as the Beijing University wall poster appeared...it im-mediately affected all the schools and the leadership and activities of allwork units. The broad masses and leaders stood face to face, exchangingfire."5 A typical example was the Beijing Aeronautics Institute, where thefirst attack against the party secretary appeared on the same morning onwhichPeople'sDailypublished theBeijingUniversity wall poster.Partyleaders scrambled to head off its repercussions: “The Beijing Universitysituation spread to our institute; many classes stopped meeting and thesituation became tense.” Six emergency meetings of the party committeeand the entire party membership were held that day. At a mass meetingof the entire school, students demanded that party members speak outand expose the errors of the party committee. Wall posters denouncingthe party committeewent up all day.6Events moved very quickly. Li Xuefeng testified, “At the time the new[Municipal]PartyCommitteehadjustbeenestablished.Wewereholding

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesparty work conferences,reshuffling theleadership of various agencies,leading the grassroots mass movement,all at the same time.Day andnight, giving speeches here, giving speeches there . . . There was an awfullot going on."7 At two separate meetings of the new Beijing Party Com-mittee on June 2 and 3, university party secretaries were reassured thatthe movement would focus on academic authorities and scholars;“thisdoes not include us here."8 The officials were reassured that “the vastmajority of party organizations at various levels are good,”and “we havesent out a few work teams, but we cannot send out too many; mainly wehave to rely on the leadership of party committees."9Within days,however, these assurances were overtaken by events.Mu-nicipal officials were surprised at the way students and teachers eagerlydenounced their leaders: “The masses had risen up, and the leadership ofmany units was paralyzed—what to do? We had no choice but to send inwork teams."1o The officials in charge of sending out work teams werelater purged and accused of sending them intentionally to suppress thestudent rebellion, but the most urgent calls to send work teams initiallycame from Mao's followers on the CCRG. Guo Yingqiu, party secretaryof Chinese People's University, was suddenly put in charge of the work-team effort in the capital.His predecessor as the municipal official incharge of the Cultural Revolution, Deng Tuo, had committed suicidetwo weeks before, shortly after he was labeled “anti-party" for mishan-dling Mao's earlier calls to launch the Cultural Revolution.11 Kang Shengand Chen Boda, two key figures on the recently formed CCRG, pressuredGuo to get work teams into schools as soon as possible.12The wave of officially sanctioned attacks on school officials created achaotic,rapidly changing political environment into which the workteamsrushedheadlong.Thenation'scapitalhadbyfarthelargestcon-centration of universities in the country.Most of theforty-nine ministriesandcommissionsundertheStateCouncilran atleastoneuniversityorin-stitute devoted to the training of their future personnel.13 In little morethan a week, thousands of party officials were selected, briefed, formedintomorethan4o0workteams,andsentwithpoorlydefinedmissionsto schools.14 The capital's bureaucracy divided up the task: work teamsfor universities and institutes were organized by the state council com-missions,nationalministries,ormunicipalbureausthatsupervised them,except for the most prestigious institutions under the Ministry of HigherEducation, which were handled by the Central Party Secretariat itself.Some 3,800 individuals served on work teams sent to universities.15

TheAssaultonPowerStructures32

GuoYingqiu's efforts to coordinate the work-team effort were futile.Work teams were drawn from a large number of national and local agen-cies and reported to theirsuperiorsin these organizations.Leaders of theseagencies maintained close contact with their work teams and,unlike themunicipal government, often intervened directly in the schools, replacingwork teams, providing instructions, and even making appearances at theschools. Coordination among them was haphazard at best.

ThePoliticalImpactofWorkTeamsThe political impact of work teams depended, first of all, on whetherthey deposed the incumbent party committee and assumed command orpermitted party leaders to carry out their own campaign.According toreports submitted by city officials at the time, the majority of universitywork teams took over from the party organization shortly after arrivingat their schools. In some schools, however, work teams tried to defendparty committees or a subset of officials in them. In these schools workteams temporarily kept incumbent leaders in their posts, and the partyorganization continued to operate. However, within two weeks almostall such efforts to defend party committees were abandoned.16If a work team deposed the party leadership, it dealt a severe blow toanyefforttorallypartyloyalists.Whenincumbentleaderswerestill inplace,theywereabletoconvenemeetings atalllevels.Membersoftheapparatus could coordinate resistance against those who attacked thepower structure, and they could pressure student activists to defend theirparty superiors and counterattack against the critics.However, if a workteamremoved the partyleadership and madeleaders“stand aside”fromtheir posts pending investigation, these leaders could no longer convenemeetings oreven communicatewiththeir colleagues.Fortheduration ofthe campaign the work team decided what meetings to convene and whocould attend. By depriving the party organization of its capacity to com-municate and organize, a work team prevented the loyalist mobilizationthat was common where work teams were never sent.17Even if a work team deposed school leaders, loyalist mobilization couldstill occur. If the work team supported university officials, consideredtheir errors tobeminor,and shielded themfromextreme accusations,itcouldstill mobilizeloyalstudentstodefendthem.Iftheworkteam's sym-pathy clearly lay with the status quo, loyal individuals could draw appro-priate conclusions. Such a work team would try to soften the impact of

33

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesthe campaign by directing the purge toward peripheral figures or rivalswithin the power structure and scapegoats outside.Whenwelookcloselyatthepoliticalimpactoftheworkteams,weneed to ask two things. First, how commonly, and how quickly, did workteams depose party committees and deprive them of a means of defense?Second, how thorough were attacks on the power structure, and to whatextentweretopofficialspermittedtoparticipateintheprocess?Thean-swers to these simple questions are far from straightforward. Work teamsadopted different stances toward school power structures,and thesestancesoftenchangedabruptly.Also,mostworkteamsinthefirstwavewere withdrawn within twoweeks and replaced by ones thatbehavedverydifferently.Ihave been able toreconstruct the events ofJune and Julyin half of thefifty-four tertiary institutions in Beijing in enough detail to characterizetheir work teams’ behavior. The sample of twenty-seven schools includesnineofthelargestten and76percentofthecity'suniversitystudentsin1966(see Table 2.1).18 These accounts describe three different types ofwork-teambehavior.Thefirst wasa“radical"strategy:the workteamremoved all party officials from their posts, declared the school's leadersand the entire power structure corrupt, and conducted an extensive in-vestigation and purge of thevastmajority of officials.These work teamswelcomed severe political accusations against virtually any member ofthe university power structure. The second type was a “conservative"stance that is the opposite of the first: the work team declared the partyleadershipbasicallysound andeither permitted it to conductits own in-vestigationandpurgesorabsorbedtopofficialsintotheworkteam.Thesework teams reacted harshly against attempts tolodge serious politicalcharges against trusted school officials. The third was a mixed type thatcontained elements of both the radical and conservative stances. Thesework teams declared that political problems at the school were severe be-cause politically problematic individuals were undermining reliable “red"leaders.Theseworkteamstookover andshieldedtheofficialstheydeemedreliably“red"whileconductingaferociouspurgeofthepowerstructureto root out political suspects.This third approach resembled theradicalone because large percentages of officials lost their posts; it resembledthe conservative one in that a portion of the power structure was deemedreliableanddefendedstubbornly.The picture is further complicated because work teams often changedstrategies abruptly and without warning or were replaced by new workTable 2.1The sample of universities

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesteams with different strategies.1" The conservative strategy was initiallyvery common,but it was quickly abandoned in almost every school. Ifwe suspect thatwork teams mobilized those withfavorablepositions inthe status quo in an effort to protect their superiors, we are forced toconfront some inconvenient facts. In the survey of the range of work-teamexperiences,there is one common theme:invirtually allschools,regardless of the work team's stance, power structures were fractured andtheir followers were divided against one another by the assaults of JuneandJuly.

RadicalWorkTeamsThere are six schools in our sample where one work team pursued a con-sistently radical course. Events at Beijing and Qinghua universities, thetwo largest and most important in the city, will be described here.20 Itwas unusual for a work team to adopt a radical stance from the outset.The decisiveness of the work teams at the larger institutions—BeijingUniversity, Qinghua University, Beijing Normal University, and the Bei-jing Institute of Politics and Law—was due to distinctive bureaucraticcircumstances. These work teams were formed by units just below theCentralCommitteeSecretariatandcontainedavarietyofhighofficialsfromarangeofministriesandcommissions.Theseofficialscouldnotbepersonallyimplicated in anypolitical problems uncovered in the schoolsand felt free to take a hard-line course.21 In these cases, finally, the deci-sion to depose the party committee and purge the school's party secre-tary for serious political transgressions was in fact made by higher off-cials even before the work team arrived.

BeijingUniversityA survey of work teams in action must begin with Beijing University(commonly referred to as “Beida"). China's premier comprehensive uni-versity was the site of the“first Marxist-Leninist wall poster”thatiniti-ated these events.The work team immediately deposed the school's partyleadership and conducted a purge that furthered the agenda of a smallopposition group within the party organization. These party dissidents,based in the Philosophy Department, had been defeated and reprimanded after an earlier conflict with Lu Ping, the school President andparty secretary, and his supporters during the Socialist Education Move-ment of 1964 and 1965.22 The work team cooperated closely with this

TheAssaultonPowerStructures36

dissidentfaction,appointed itsmembers toleadingposts,and gave themfreerein in attacking their enemies.This close cooperation between thework team and the university's indigenous “rebels” lasted until late JulyTheMay25wallposteriswidelycreditedwithinspiringthestudentrebellion that led to the red guard movement of August, and its authorslater became prominentleaders of red guard factions.However,none ofthe authors were students. The first-named author, Nie Yuanzi, was gen-eral branch party secretary of the Philosophy Department, and her sixcoauthors were all instructors of Marxism-Leninism and senior partymembers.23 Although Nie emerged as a famous rebel, she was clearly partof the party establishment. As a member of the Beida Party Committee andone of twenty-one general branch secretaries, she was among the top thirtyoffcials in the school. When the wall poster appeared, she was forty-fiveyears old and married to a high official in the central party apparatustwentyyearshersenior.24Nie's rebellion against her party superiors was the culmination of twoyears of conflict with the university's top offcial, Lu Ping, and she initi-ated it only after prior assurances of backing from the highest levels ofthe national leadership.25 The wall poster ignited a heated campus debate.Supporters of the party committee denounced Nie and her group as op-portunists and accused them of an anti-party conspiracy.26 The school'stop leaders, however, split over the accusations. Two powerful figures—party First Vice-Secretary Ge Hua and standing committee member CuiXiongkun—challenged Lu Ping to respond to the charges and resisted ef-forts to squelch the controversy. They argued that the wall poster raisedbasic political questions about the Socialist Education Movement andsent a letter to the Central Committee denouncing Lu Ping for attemptingto“suppressrevolution."27The issue was settled when on June 1 Mao personally ordered that thewall poster be published nationwide. In instructions to Kang Sheng andChen Boda, he wrote, “It is absolutely essential to circulate this in news-papers nationwide.Now we can start to smash the stronghold of reac-tion at Beijing University."28 Zhang Chengxian arrived that evening andannounced that Lu Ping was out, along with the entire party commit-tee.29 This was a complete victory for the school's dissidents.CaoYi'ou,Kang Sheng's wife, who had instigated the wall poster on his behalf, be-came vice-head of the work team.She kept that post through the end ofJulyand actedasliaisonwiththeCCRG.30Severalotherswhohadhelpecinstigateorwritethewallposterorwhohadsidedwiththecoauthorsin

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiespast conflicts were given positions on thework team,which immediatelyimplemented the agenda of the university dissidents.31 Their originalcharge against Lu Ping in 1964 had been that he had permitted too many"politically impure elements” to assume prominent posts. In the ensuingweeks theworkteamdirected a campaign to denounce thevastmajorityof administrators and faculty for reactionary political viewpoints andimpure class origins or political histories. The purge targeted two groups:prominent intellectuals whose personal histories or political leaningswere considered suspicious—the people the dissident party faction wantedto depose in the Socialist Education Movement—and Lu Ping loyalistswho had defended him in the earlier struggle.32By any standard the work team's purge was harsh. Accusations weremade during public “struggle sessions": the accused were put on a stageand subjected toharrowing interrogations designed to extract confes-sions, usually with shouted denunciations, chanting crowds, and physicalhumiliation.Accordingtotheworkteam'srecords,byJune26,230cadresandteachersweretargetedasenemies;157weredismissedfromtheirposts, 192 had been put through struggle sessions, 94 had been beaten,and 107 had been paraded on campus in processions where they woretall dunce hat and placards describing their crimes.33 The work teamclassified all cadres into four categories according to the severity of theiralleged errors. Category 1 consisted of those who had committed no errorsand were entirely trustworthy; category 2 of those who had committedminor errors that could be remedied with sincere self-criticism; category3 of those who had committed serious errors that required removal fromtheir posts and a prolonged period of interrogation and self-examination.and category 4 of class enemies to be dismissed from the party and per-haps sent into a labor camp or internal exile.34By July 10 the work team had almost finished,and its judgments werevery severe. Only one out of twenty general branch secretaries (Nie Yuanzi)was judged reliable, and sixteen were placed in category 4 (see Table 2.2).Fewer than 8 percent of all the cadres were judged to be without error,andtwo-thirdswereincategories3and4.In sum,theworkteamvindi-catedthedissidentgroup'saccusations,datingbackto1964,thattheschool's party committee was a “revisionist black nest" and “rotten tothecore."The close cooperation between the work team and the school's dissi-dents lasted until late July. Prominent members of the dissident groupplayed a leading role on the work team, making important speeches and

expressing support for the work team's conduct.Not until July 19 didNie Yuanzi criticize the work team and its leader, Zhang Chengxian.35This was her response toinformation that Maohad grown disenchantedwiththeactionsofworkteamsandwasabouttoordertheirwith-drawal.36

QinghuaUniversityQinghua was China's premier scientific and engineering university, andits president and party secretary, Jiang Nanxiang, was the highest-rankingacademic administratorin the country,servingsimultaneously asministerof higher education.37 He was an obvious target for any purge of aca-demic circles. For more than a week after the publication of the Beida wallposter, Jiang attempted to fend off similar accusations by relying on loyalmembers of Qinghua's party organization. These efforts ended abruptlyafter the work team's arrival on June 8 and Jiang's purge two days later.38In the wake of Jiang's purge, a large work team headed by a vice-chairmanof theStateEconomicCommissionandtwovice-ministerstookoverleadershipoftheschool.UnlikeBeida'sworkteam,thisoneacknowledged no genuine “leftists” among the dissidents in the schoolhierarchy. It immediately suspended all school offcials from their postsand had them stand aside for investigation and criticism.39 Even the ordi-nary members of party branch committees were suspended.The impact of the work team's assault on the power structure can begauged from the treatment of those suspended from their posts. The

39

WorkTeamsin theUniversitieswork team organizedtwo“labor reformbrigades.”In the first(type 1inTable 2.3),the accused performed manual labor all day under the supervision of guards, with a signboard hanging from their necks labelingthem members of the“black gang,”and every day or two the victimwould have to turn in a labor diary. The second was a lighter version(type 2 in Table 2.3) in which the victim worked without supervision orsignboard for half a day and gave an oral report every few days. The topschool authorities were treated the most harshly: only 14 of 206 top of-ficials escaped labor reform, and 162 were type 1 “black gang." All but2 of the 31 members of the university's party committee were subjectedto the harsher type of labor reform (Table 2.3).Qinghua's work teamconducted the most militant purge of any university I can document. Un-like Beida's work team, it did not acknowledge the revolutionary creden-tialsofadissidentpartygroup.

ConservativeWorkTeamsConservative work teams took a diametrically opposed approach.Theyinsistedthattheschool'sleadershipwasbasicallyreliable,andtheyre-fused to depose the party secretary. Instead of orchestrating devastatingpurges of the entire party apparatus, they spent much of their time de-fending party officials. This was a common strategy among the first waveof work teams in early June. In almost all these cases the ministry di-rectly responsible for administering these schools sent the work team. Insome cases the individual personally responsiblefor supervising the schoolwas put in charge. Conservatism appears to have been one response to apotential conflict of interest: if severe political problems were uncoveredintheschool,thiswouldimplicateofficialsintheministryresponsiblefor the school. A conservative work-team strategy was clearly an effort tominimize the political damage.A conservative strategy usually encountered strong internal oppositionand was difficult to sustain. At only four of the twenty-seven schools inmy sample did the work teams maintain a conservative stance until theend of July.Another eleven work teams quickly shifted to a more radicalcourse orwerereplacedbyasecond,moreradicalworkteam.Theim-pact of the four conservative work teams was far from straightforward andwas very different from what one might have imagined. Despite shieldingtop officials, conservative work teams conducted extensive purges thatdecimatedthemiddle andlowerreachesoftheschool'spowerstructure.n

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesByinvitingcriticismoftopofficialsandthenretaliatingagainstthosewhodid so,they created deep and irrevocable splits within thepowerstructure itself. This is illustrated by events at the Beijing Mining Insti-tute and the Central Nationalities Institute.40

BeijingMiningInstituteThe work team at the Beijing Mining Institute refused to depose the partyleadership because the Ministry of Coal had already purged the partycommitteeseveral monthsbefore.41 Theinstitute'spresidentwasremovedfrom office for errors similar to those later lodged against Lu Ping at Beida.and its party committee was reorganized. When the Cultural Revolutionbegan, ministry officials felt that they had already cleaned house in theMining Institute. They were convinced that the new party secretary,ZhangXuewen,was politically reliable.The new school party committee began its purge campaign in mid-May, well before the appearance of the Beida wall poster. Party SecretaryZhang deflected criticism by claiming that he was already a proven left-ist.HeassertedthatthosewhohadstudiedintheSovietUnionwereleftist,while cadres frombourgeois backgrounds or with questionable po-litical histories were no good. Charging that the entire school, under theinfluence of his predecessor, had been infected with a “black line,” Zhangproceeded to purge the apparatus under him of loyal followers of thepreviousparty committee.He drew up ablacklistthatincluded nineteenof twenty-three department chairmen and vice-chairmen.The work team sent by the ministry in mid-June simply intensified thepurge campaign thatwas alreadyunderway.PartySecretaryZhangleftforthebeachresort atBeidaihe andstayeduntilmid-July.Inhis absencethe work team escalated the campaign against alleged followers of theold party committee, and cadres who protested were attacked and theirhouses searched. After the work team finished its purge and silenced dis-senting voices, Zhang returned to the school and joined the leading groupof the work team. When the work team was withdrawn at the end of July,it transferred power back to him,and he resumed his role as the tormen-tor of cadres loyal to the old party committee. The purge at the MiningInstitute was extensive,but it was conduced by the existing school lead-ershipwith thefirmbacking of the ministry'swork team.

TheAssaultonPowerStructures42

CentralNationalitiesInstituteThe impact of the work team at the Central Nationalities Institute, sentby theCentralCommittee'sNationalitiesAffairsCommission,wasespe-cially complicated.It shows how even a conservative work team couldsplit university power structures and present students with confusing po-litical choices.The work team arrived on June 2, the same day the Beidawall poster was celebrated in the mass media. It was led by an official whowasvice-headoftheCCPUnitedFrontWorkDepartment,vice-chairmanof the CCP Nationalities Affairs Commission, and concurrently presidentof the Nationalities Institute itself.42 Not surprisingly, this work team, ledby officials directly responsible for the school, reacted with harsh defen-siveness to all efforts to lodge accusations against the school's leadershipIt appointed the institute's party secretary to head the school's CulturalRevolution committee and conducted a campaign that evaluated the po-litical loyalty of all students and faculty and classified them as “leftist,""middle-of-the-road,” or “rightist.” In one department 80 percent of thefaculty and staff were classified as “beyond redemption."Throughoutthe work team's stay, students and othersput up wall posters demandingthat the work team change course or withdraw, but they were attackedinturn.Political alignments in the institute were scrambled when the vice-headof the Cultural Revolution committee, a teacher from a “revolutionarycadre” household named Zheng Zhongbing, defected to the opposition.Zheng had been loyal to the work team and actively defended it for morethansixweeks,butsuddenlyonJuly17heandfour othersputupawallposter that denounced the work team for sabotaging the Cultural Revo-lution and charged that “the work team did not come to the institute tofoment revolution, but to hatch conspiracies." Zheng became a leader ofthe budding opposition, and on July 28, just as work teams were abouttobe ordered out of all schools,he authored a wall poster signed by morethan1o0othersthatdemandedtheworkteam'swithdrawal.Zhengsub-sequently claimed the mantle of the “anti-work-team” camp and eventu-allybecametheleaderofoneofthetwomainredguardfactionsintheschool. However, he was opposed by large numbers of students who hadopposed thework team from the beginning.They sawhislateJuly about-face as an opportunist act by someone who had long cooperated with thework team. This was the origin of the split between rebel forces at theNationalitiesInstitutethatlasteduntiltheendoftheCulturalRevolution.WorkTeams in theUniversities

MixedStrategiesSome work teams adopted a strategy that contained elements of bothradical and conservative approaches. Its defining feature was that thework team found serious political problems at the school but identified areliable“red”line within theleadership and defendedit from criticism.This strategy was easily the most divisive of all. By identifying a “red"line in the school and turning its adherents against colleagues said to fol-low a“black”line,this stance divided the school's power structure intwo and turned one side against the other. It shattered the power struc-ture into two large and sharply opposing groups: victims and their tor-mentors.Work teams at six schools in my sample pursued it consistentlythrough June and July. The examples of Chinese People's University, Bei-jing Agricultural University, and the Beijing Steel Institute will be de-scribed here.43

Chinese People's UniversityTheworkteamatChinesePeople'sUniversityarrivedlate—June14—and suffered from a severe conflict of interest that prevented it from ac-knowledging serious criticisms of the school's party secretary, GuoYingqiu, who had been promoted three weeks earlier to direct workteams for the new Municipal Party Committee.44 This put the work teamin an impossible situation: if it resisted accusations against Guo, it wouldbe seen as protecting him, but if it accepted the accusations, it would becrossingitssuperior.Within the limits of its position, the work team adopted a militantstance from the outset. It seized power from the party committee and hadall cadres in the power structure stand aside from their posts pending in-vestigation, even political instructors and student cadres in the party andyouth league. In a speech on the first day he arrived, the work team'shead announced that anyone or anything could be exposed—there wouldbe no limits. Cultural Revolution committees in all departments held ac.cusation meetings against department leaders.In some departments al-mostallleadingcadresweredenounced.When this process threatened totouch upon GuoYingqiu,however,thework team backpedaled from its stated position.Shortly after the workteam arrived, the vice-chairman of thePhilosophyDepartment,who wasalso a member of the school's party committee, denounced one of Guo's

TheAssaultonPowerStructures44

deputies in connection with “the party committee problem." The nextday the work team's head called an all-school mass meeting to declarethat Guo Yingqiu was a genuine leftist. The work team refused to permithis deputies to be put through struggle sessions, and soon the vicechairman of the Philosophy Department himself was accused of politicalcrimes. Critics argued that in a school where so many in the power structure were found to have committed errors, those ultimately in chargecould not be absolved of blame. Accusations persisted,and many of thecritics were labeled anti-party and were subjected to struggle sessions.Within two weeks the work team decreed that all struggle sessions had tobe cleared in advance. In the meantime, the work team's purge proceeded,and 538 individuals were designated“rightists"—12 percent of the entireschool community. The purge hit the cadre ranks the hardest: 145 out ofthe 257 cadres in the school, more than half, fell in the campaign.No matter how militant its purge, the work team was dogged bycharges that it was protecting the leaders ultimately responsible for theschool. As critics of the party committee continued to suffer from coun-terattacks,suspicion grew that thecriticswerevictims of aconspiracy tocoverupandprotectGuoandhistwoassociates.Themoremilitant thework team's purge, the more it seemed that it was trying to protect Guo.The identification of the work team with the school's party secretary di-vided the school's power structure and the student community long aftertheworkteam'swithdrawal.

BeijingAgriculturalUniversityThe work team sent to Beijing Agricultural University refused to purge itspower structure because this had already been done. In the first days ofJune,theMinistry of Agriculture acted to preempt student rebellion byunilaterally purging the party standing committee.45 Claiming to haverooted out all political problems in the school, the ministry put the partycommittee in charge of the coming campaign. This left the original partysecretary and one of the party vice-secretaries in control during the entirefirst half of June. Initially they shielded the party apparatus from attack.On June 3,the day after the publication of theBeida wall poster,the partysecretary gave a speech and declared that his party committee was revolu-tionary. He formed an investigation group that would focus on bourgeoisprofessors, health clinic workers, and the school's post office. He calledon all political activists to expose and criticize people in these units.

45

WorkTeamsintheUniversitiesAfter the work team arrived on June 14,it left the new party commit-tee in place,but it pushed for a more radical attack on the power struc-ture.Itdeclared thatits taskwas todistinguishthe“redline”within theschool from the “black line." The party secretary and a few of his closeassociates represented that “red line,”while the “black line”had deeplyinfluenced the rest of the power structure. The work team charged thatthe general branch secretaries were particularly problematic. It waged anextensive campaign against the power structure.Almost all officeholderswere temporarily suspended.General branch secretaries,basic-levelcadres, class counselors, and even ordinary party members were investi-gated and forced to make self-criticisms before a final verdict would bereached.Intheend,onlysevenofthetwenty-fivemembersoftheschool'sparty committeekept their posts.Eighty percent of the cadres at thedivision-head level were forced to stand aside, and 90 percent of those atthe general branch secretary level.Almost all of the nineteen departmentheads and general branch secretaries lost their posts, as did large num-bers of branch secretaries and classroom counselors.When the workteamwithdrewattheendofJuly,itlefttheoriginalpartysecretary incharge of a thoroughly purged power structure made up of fortunate sur-vivors and activists who had been promoted for cooperating with thework team's assault. It also left behind a large number of victims whofelt that top officials had sacrificed them in a cynical strategy of survival.

BeijingSteelInstituteThe Beijing Steel Institute's party secretary, Gao Yunsheng, initiated acampaign against politicallybackward elements in his school well beforethe work team arrived.46 Unlike his colleague at Beijing Agricultural University,however,his superiors in the ministry sold him out. In April 1966Gao charged that one of his deputies, Vice-Secretary Zhang Wenqi, andtwo other members of the party committee had advanced a “bourgeoisline” in education. He orchestrated a criticism campaign against themand their followers. Gao's preemptive show of leftist rectitude did littleto prevent the appearance of wall posters denouncing him after the pub-lication of the Beida wall poster on June 2,nor did it win him the sup-port of his superiors in the ministry. In fact, his harsh purge campaignmotivated many of the accusations against him. The work team arrived onJune 4, having already been told by ministry officials that the school hadserious political problems that centered on Gao himself.As wall-poster

attacksonGaoescalated,theworkteamfinallyannouncedonJune10that Gao was out, the work team would take control, and all cadres wouldstandasideforinvestigation.Gao's downfall meant that the verdicts on his recent victims, ZhangWenqi and two other party committee members, would be reversed. Theensuing campaign turned into an attack on the followers of “the GaoYunsheng line,”while the work team defended Gao's former victims andtheir reputed followers. In a manner typical of a mixed strategy, theschool's power structure was turned against itself. Those who had earlierbeen threatened by Gao's campaign denounced him and his followers.Also typical of a mixed strategy, the purges hit roughly half the powerstructure. Out of the school's sixty-seven middle-level cadres, thirty weresubjected to struggle sessions and paraded around the campus groundswith dunce caps, and forty-seven were placed in categories 3 and 4. Thesplits in the school were intensified by Gao Yunsheng's dramatic suicideon July 3. The divisions endured long after the work team's withdrawal,expressed as a debate over Gao's innocence or guilt.

WorkTeamsThatReversedCourseWork teams sent by agencies directly responsible for a school faced aprofound conflict of interest.Serious political problems in the schoolmightimplicatethemaswell.Theseworkteamsfacedastrategiodilemma:should they try to shore up the school's party committee anddeny serious political problems in the school, or should they adopt a rad-ical stance and prove their rectitude with a militant purge? Some workteamsadoptedthefirststrategybutsuddenlyabandoneditforthesecondin the face of mounting student opposition.This sequence was observedat six schools where work teams,after an initialdelay,suddenly shiftedtoaradicalormixedstance.Twoofthem—BeijingAeronauticsInstituteand Beijing Geology Institute—had large student bodies and played acrucial role in the subsequent red guard movement.47

BeijingAeronauticsInstituteThe Beijing Aeronautics Institute, a college of aeronautical engineering,was directly under theNational DefenseScience and Technology Com-mission, which in turn was directly under the Ministry of Defense.48 OnMay 23 ZhaoRuzhang,the official in the commission who was inWorkTeamsin theUniversities

47charge of the institute, arrived with a liaison group that was sent to helpthe school carry out the Cultural Revolution.49 After the Beida wall posterwas publicized on June 2, posters critical of the school's party committeebegan to appear, and over the next few days new wall posters accused thecommission of political errors. Soon afterward the liaison group was re-organized as a work team. Zhao Ruzhang remained in the school and at-tended all meetings of the party committee. He stated that his work teamwas there simply to assist the school party committee, and that the criti-cisms of it were overblown, cases of “leftists attacking leftists." He re-peatedly counseled people to calm down,and he minimized the politicalproblemsintheschool.The work team was welcomed at a mass meeting on June 8, with ZhaoRuzhang as its head. Zhao proclaimed that the school's leaders wouldstayin power and thework team wouldworkunder their direction.Theinstitute’s party secretary gave a self-critical speech and invited criticismsof the party committee. The conciliatory attitude did not appease critics.The accusations escalated,and the party committee wasincreasingly puton the defensive.The work team did notintervene tohalt the criticismsbut eventually concluded that the party secretary would not be able towithstand the escalating attacks.Finally,on June 16 orders came downfrom the commission to remove the party secretary from his post.50Atthispointtheworkteamseizedcontrolanddeclaredthattheschool'sparty organization had serious political problems. It initiated a campaignin which all officials stood aside for investigation. Of the eight top schoolofficials,five were judged to have serious political problems, six were re-moved from their posts, four were subjected to struggle sessions, and allhad their homes searched and performed manual labor on campus(seeTable2.4).Outofthirty-threecadres atthenexttwodepartmentallevels.onlyfour were judged tobe free of serious political problems.Even politi-cal instructors were made to stand aside (88 percent), although few werefound to have committed serious errors (10 percent) and fewer still weresubjected to struggle sessions.The work team at the Aeronautics Institutetherefore took fundamentally different positions before and after June 16.Itwasasiftwodifferentworkteamshadbeensenttotheschool.

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesobserved the uproar that followed the June 2 publication of the Beidawallposter.Wallpostersdenouncingtheschool'spartycommitteewentup the same day. One of the institute’s party vice-secretaries gave a speechto students that day offering a self-criticism on behalf of the party com-mittee. He then announced that the party committee would begin a recti-fication campaign that would start at the top of the party hierarchy. Thenext day the party secretary and ranking vice-minister of geology, HeChanggong,1 personally visited the institute and made a speech intendedto avert extreme accusations. The school's party committee, he assuredeveryone, was revolutionary; it was not the same as Beida or the old BeijingParty Committee. This later proved to be a fateful act because it insertedthe vice-minister personally into the internal politics of the school.Wallposters defending the school's party committee appeared shortly after He'svisit.Thecriticslatercomplainedthattheywereonthedefensiveforthenext week. Political instructors and party branch secretaries were orderedto hold study sessions to “absorb the lessons of the 1957 anti-rightist cam-paign,”when critics of the party committees were accused of politicalcrimes and sent to labor camps.2Despite these warnings, critics persisted. On June 13 the full workteam finally arrived. Led by Vice-Minister Zou Jiayou,$3 it included morethan 2o0 members who were prepared to run investigations in all de-partments and offices. Inspired by the work team's arrival and by newsof developments at nearby Qinghua University (where President JiangNanxiang's purge was announced on June 10), students and teachers or-ganized struggle sessions against members of the party committee. Theworkteaminitiallydidnotinterveneandpermittedthestrugglesessionstotakeplace.54However, many students had not forgotten Vice-Minister He Chang-gong's June 3 speech, in which he asserted that there were no seriouspolitical problems in the school. In the course of struggle sessions, schoolofficials confessed that their actions had the prior approval of theministrythey were “just carrying out orders.” Students drew the obviousconclusion: the school's “black line”extended into the ministry, just asBeida's problems were rooted in theBeijingParty Committee.Had not thevice-ministerhimselftried tocover thingsup?This was a conclusion that the work team clearly wanted to avoid.Theday the work team arrived at the school,Vice-Minister Xu Guangyi madeaspeechemphasizingthatthepoliticalproblemsintheinstitutewerenotthe fault of the ministry.55 The institute's party committee, however, should

TheAssaultonPowerStructures50

be looked into. The next day the work team ordered the institute's partysecretaryandpresident,GaoYuangui,tomakeaself-criticismbeforethewhole school. Struggle sessions and interrogations of one of the insti-tute's party vice-secretaries, however, turned up evidence implicating topministry officials.At this point the work team intervened, canceled plansfor further interrogation of the vice-secretary, and instead scheduled amass criticismassemblyagainstGaoYuangui.OnJune 21amember ofthe work team told students that the school's party secretary no longerhad the support of the ministry and was fair game. Gao Yuangui had"failed to accept the correct leadership of the ministry."56The work team's increasingly militant stance toward school officialswas clearlyintended to avoid implicating ministry officials in the escalat-ing accusations. The work team had not tried to prevent student attacksagainst top school officials, but when their confessions began to implicate the ministry, it moved quickly against the school's party secretary.The Geology Institute work team, in the end, did not attempt to protectschool officials but sought to blame them for all errors and in so doingshield the ministry. As we shall see in the next chapter, this maneuversplit the school's power structure and student body into supporters andopponents of the work team's maneuver.

TwoWorkTeamsAlthough some of the conservativework teams were able toreverse courseand survive, others faced such serious opposition that they withdrew andhad to be replaced. This occurred in five of the schools in my sample, andin every case thesecond workteam adopted a radical stance.Two of thesecases—BeijingIndustrialUniversityandtheBeijingPostandTelecommu-nicationsInstitute—had importantimplications outside their campusesand will be described here.57

Beijing Industrial UniversityPerhaps the clearest example of successive work teams that adopted dia-metrically opposed stances is Beijing Industrial University. This obscurepolytechnic under the municipal government had admitted its first classof students only in 1960. Its party secretary, however, was anything butobscure. He was Song Shuo, who was also vice-head of the MunicipalParty Committee's University and Science Work Department and one of

WorkTeamsin theUniversitiesthe three officials denounced in Nie Yuanzi's famous Beida wall posterand whose June 3 purge was announced in People's Daily.s8 Fang Zhixivice-chairman of the Economics Department and member of the partycommittee of Chinese People's University, headed the first work team.59Fang's low rank attested to thelow prestige of a new technical collegerunbythe citygovernment.Despite the school's direct connection through Song Shuo to the anti-party conspiracy recently exposed inBeijing,the first work team took aremarkably soft line after arriving on June 2. It announced that it would"assist in revolutionizing the party committee” and left it in charge. In-cumbent officials at each level would lead a movement of criticism andself-criticism; party and youth league members were to criticize their ownerrorsandencourageotherstodothesame.Notsurprisingly,thisap-proach led to strong resistance from students and teachers who assertedthat a party committee led bySong Shuo must have committed seriouserrors and couldnotbeleftincharge.Theworkteamwasunabletohan-dle the growing opposition and was replaced on June 16 by a new workteam that had an entirely different attitude.60A cadre of much higher rank and more impressive political credentialsled the second work team. Du Wanrong was vice-director of the PoliticalDepartment of the People's Liberation Army General Staff Headquartersand had been a political commissar in the Eighth Route Army in NorthChina during the 1940s.61 He declared a radical agenda immediatelyafter entering the school: every cadre in the school would step down fromhis or her post, be put in isolation, and write a self-examination. Thework team suspended the entire party organization and took over theschool, and the power structure was decimated by the campaign.Figures later compiled by the opponents of the work teams reveal apurge that was as drastic as any in the city (see Table 2.5). Only 20 per-cent of the school's cadres were judged to be “good" or “relativelygood,” while 36 percent were “anti-party." The purge hit high-levelcadres the hardest: none of the top officials and only four section and de-partment heads were deemed at least“relatively good"—fewer than 10percent. Lower-ranking cadres were treated more leniently—26 percentwere at least “relatively good." Over half the middle-level cadres weresubjected to struggle sessions,along with 20percent of thebasic-levelcadres. The purge was so severe that even ordinary party members wereoften found to be lacking: in one department only four out of twentyparty members were considered good enough to be nominated for a new(d-)

Instructors intheschool'sMarxism-LeninismTeachingOfficelodged thefirstseriousaccusations against the school'sleaders.The school's “first Marxist-Leninist wall poster” was put up on May 24—a day before the more cel-ebrated one at Beida—and was followed on June 3 and 4 by several oth-ers denouncing an“anti-Mao Thought clique”led by the school's partysecretary.62 Several party vice-secretaries rallied loyal party members intheir defense,and militant students attacked the critics. The first workteam, led by the head of the ministry's Education Department, arrived inthe midst of this debate on June 4. It did not take a stand on the criticalwall posters, but it left the party committee in charge and permitted theattacksonthecriticsfromtheMarxism-LeninismTeachingOfficetocontinue.The critics, like Nie Yuanzi's group at Beida, were all instructors ofMarxism-Leninism, but the work team, instead of following the Beidascenario by deposing the party committee and elevating the critics, keptthe party committee in power and left the critics vulnerable to retribution.Theobviousviolationof theBeidascriptledtoincreasedsupportforthe

This ended the orchestrated attacks on the party com-mittee'scritics.Theworkteamannouncedthattheschool'spresidentwasstrippedofallposts onJune18,andlater thatmonththeworkteamorchestratedcriticismofthepartysecretary.Despite this newly militant stand,the work team became entangled inanescalating dispute with studentswhohadbeenvictimized earlier inthe month by the first work team. The conflict began on June 11, when200 to 300 students marched to the ministry's offices to put up wallposters denouncing the head of the first work team, and they demandedthat he be brought back to the campus to answer for his errors. The nextday another group of students went to the ministry and raised the stakesof the struggle when they denounced the work team's superiors on theministry's party committee.This set off a series of maneuvers by the min-istry'stopofficialsthatdrewthesecondworkteamintothemiddleof anescalatingdispute.Increasinglyunder attackintheschool,despiteitsmil-itant stance toward the institute's party leadership, the work team wasordered to counterattack, and its purge of the party apparatus was di-verted into a campaign against a large opposition movement that will bedescribedinthenextchapter.The remarkably diverse work-team histories in the twenty-seven schools inmy sample, summarized in Table 2.6, defy simple characterization. In thesixteen cases where a single work team pursued the same strategy to theend of July, the mixed strategy was as common as the radical one, whilethe conservative strategy was somewhat less common.

Technologyuniversities in my sample were under severe assault. Either a radicalwork team attacked the entire power structure or a mixed strategy splitit intwo.It should be apparent that university power structures were deeply al-tered,if not completely shattered,by theinterventions of the workteams.According to incomplete statistics circulated in the MunicipalParty Committee's internal bulletin at the time, by mid-July 55 percent ofall university party first secretaries and 40 percent of all general branchsecretaries had been labeled anti-party reactionaries and placed in cate-gory 4.63 Work teams that launched a withering assault made it virtuallyimpossible for those connected to the power structure to mobilize in itsdefense.Work teams that were radical from the outset decapitated schoolpower structures and immobilized them. After a delay of a week or two,the same thing occurred at universities where conservative work teamschanged course or were replaced.By the third week of June,party com-mittees in all these schools were so thoroughly discredited that there wasnever any prospect for loyal students to mobilize in their defense. Wherework teams pursued a mixed strategy and sought to shield trusted “red"elements in a school's leadership,the power structure splintered as thoseassociated with one leadership group turned on the others.When political hierarchies are shattered in this manner, they no longerprovide a basis for predicting the political affiliations of those mostcloselyassociatedwiththem.Afavorablepositioninthestatusquodoesnotcreateuniforminterests thatdistinguishthefavoredfromthelessfa-vored. The status quo no longer exists. If work teams had never enteredthe universities, or if the brief interlude of work teams that supported partycommittees had not ended so abruptly,those closely tied to the powerstructure would likely have rallied around their party superiors—withtheir clear encouragement—todefend them against serious accusations.58

TheAssaultonPowerStructuresThis occurred in many of the universities in my sample when incumbentparty officials were put in charge. But this stance did not survive past mid-June, and as school power structures were shattered, their once-formidablenetworks were paralyzed and fragmented. The next chapter documentshow the abrupt and unpredictable breakdown of school power structuresdrew many students and others, including large numbers of those closelytied to school power structures, into harrowing confrontations with theworkteams.

3THEGENESISOFDIVISION

SourcesofOppositionandConflictFactions appeared soon after the abrupt withdrawal of work teams. Stu-dents who had actively or passively cooperated with the work team formedthe dominant faction. In virtually every school, however, there was asmaller dissident group composed of two distinct kinds of people: thosewhohad challenged the work team and were punished in response, andthose who had not challenged the work team but were placed under po-litical suspicion or otherwise marginalized. Understanding the origins ofred guard factions requires a closer look at the conflicts that occurredwithinschoolsunder theworkteams.We need to ask three questions about these conflicts.What were theirorigins, if they were not contests that pitted those with vested interestsin the status quo against challengers formerly marginalized by it? Whochallenged the work teams, and in particular, what is the evidence thatthe challengers commonly had strong ties to power structures? How didwork teams create identifiable groups within the school who would sym-pathize with student challengers? Only by answering these questions canwe explain the almost instantaneous emergence of two antagonistic fac-tionsinearlyAugust.The first wave of work teams clashed with students immediately andoften provoked harsh counterattacks. In his report to the Beijing Munic-ipal Party Committee on July 3, Guo Yingqiu emphasized the need tocurtail violence. Work teams struggled to control a rising tide of violencetoward party officials.Of particular concern to Guo was a wave of vio-lent struggle sessions at Beida on June 18 and on other campuses. Guo citedfigures from nine leading institutions,where 138 leading cadres werebeaten during spontaneous struggle sessions. The movement to drive workteams away from the universities reached a high point on June 17, and

The Genesis of Division60

within a few days thirty-nine work teams had retreated from universitycampuses at least temporarily.1 By early July the work teams were fullyincontrolinonlynineschools—GuocitedBeidaasanexample.Intwenty-one schools the work teams had gained the upper hand after con-fronting their opponents—Guo cited Qinghua as an example. In tenschools,Guo said, the students were out of control.Although the effort to curtail violence was indeed a major source ofconflict, it was only part of a larger constellation of issues. Just as the po-liticalactionsofworkteamsvariedwidely,sodidthespecificissuesandmotives that generated conflict. Work teams divided university communi-tiesnomatterwhatstancetheytook,howseveretheconflicts,orhowwidespread the opposition. This is clear if we examine the conflicts ofthework-teamperiodby their degree of severity.Inthefirst category are"pacified” campuses, where the work team met no overt opposition orwas able quickly to suppress it. The second category includes campuseswhere the work team confronted challenges from militant students andfelt compelled to punish those who refused to back down. The third typeconsistsofcampuseswhereworkteamsfacedmajorchallengesandgenerated confrontations so severe that they had to call in higher authoritiesfor help and mount an extensive campaign to punish and intimidate op-ponents.

PacifiedCampusesAfter early June opposition on most of the campuses in my sample waseither nonexistent or weak. These campuses experienced the entire rangeof work-team strategies. Two cases will be described in some detail be-cause their factional divisions played an important role in the later devel-opment of the Beijing red guard movement: Beijing University and Bei-jing Industrial University. On six other campuses in my sample, conflictsinitially generated by work teams were quickly suppressed,but in eachcase they left a lasting legacy. The example of Beijing Agricultural Uni-versity will be described here.2

BeijingUniversityBeida's work teamwas the first tobe denounced and removed for sup-pressing the student movement, but it never faced serious opposition. Itpunished no more than a handful of students for violence during struggleSourcesofOpposition andConflict

61sessions.Instead,conflictemergedfromwithintheworkteamitselfbecause of the factional maneuverings of politicians in the national leader-ship. The work team's defining act was its response to campus violencein mid-June. Its treatment of the perpetrators was remarkably mild, com-pared with what later transpired on other campuses, but its report to theCentralCommittee on the“June 18 incident"denounced student vio-lence in no uncertain terms. The report was soon transmitted to party or-ganizations nationwide as a model of how to restrain campus militants.Itwasthisreportthatledtotheworkteam'sdownfall.During the second week of June violence on campus escalated sharplyVictims were fitted with tall dunce caps, placards were hung from theinnecks, they were shoved about violently on the stage, their hair was pulled.their arms were fixed behind them, big character posters were pasted ontheir bodies, and violence sometimes culminated in severe beatings. Thevice-chairman of the History Department committed suicide on June 11after this treatment. The work team counseled moderation, but with littleeffect. By June 17 it calculated that 178 cadres, teachers, and students hadbeen indiscriminately beaten and humiliated.3Zhang Chengxian later blamed this on the head of his staff office, NieYuanzi, who had contacts all over campus and was the main point of com-munication between the work team's leading group and other parts of theuniversity.4Nie,he recalled,was motivated by personal revenge,freely ac-cusedpeopleofseriouspoliticalcrimes,andletstudentsdragoutandbeatwhomever they pleased. Zhang felt that the work team needed to assertcontrol: accusations and struggle sessions should come only after carefulinvestigation todetermine guilt.5At a mass meeting on June 15hewarned.“We must present the facts and reason things out. To just let yourself go,vent your anger, beat people, put tall hats on people does not solve any-thing."6Despitetheseefforts,violentstrugglesessionsbrokeoutacrosscam-pus on June 18. Platforms were erected in several locations, and close toseventy prominent cadres and teachers were dragged onto them wearingtallhats andplacards,theirfaces coveredwithblackink,andtheywerebeaten and kicked while accusations were screamed at them. The victimsincluded the university's top officials, most of whom had already beendenounced by the work team. Six were members of the party standingcommittee, forty-one were members of the university's party committeeor general branch committees, and seven were secretaries or members ofyouth league general branch committees. Members of the work team

fanned out across campus, shut down the struggle sessions, and arrangedfirstaidforthevictims.The work team decided to make a negative example of the incident.Zhang Chengxianknew that there was wide participation in these activ-ities, but in order to convince students that such tactics were illegitimate,he focused on a few scapegoats.8 Zhang addressed the university overthe public address system and described four “bad elements” caught red-handed. One was a “hooligan” who had beaten people and behaved in alicentious manner toward female students, and a second was a descen-dant of a Nationalist Army commander on the campus workforce whohad beaten people severely.A third claimed falsely to be a student atBeida High School, and a fourth had torn the clothes of female party sec-retaries during a struggle session during which he fondled their breastsand groped inside their pants.The university security department de-tained all four.9 Zhang charged that “bad elements” were infiltrating thecampus tolead students astray and blacken the reputation of the CulturalRevolution. He called for greater discipline and vigilance; intrudersshould be kept off campus, and the work team should organize all futurestruggle sessions. The work team would conduct further investigations.10The next day the work team submitted a report to the Central Com-mittee about the“June 18incident."It was necessary to“expose and con-demn the counterrevolutionary conspiratorial behavior of such bad peo-ple,”which served to“blacken the reputation of the work team and throwthe movement into chaos."”On June 20 the report was transmitted to partycommitteesnationwideasacentralpartydocument,withtheCentralSec-retariat's commentthattheworkteam's actionsinthiscasewere“correctandtimely."11Other leaders wanted to take a stronger stand and place a more sinis-terinterpretation on the event.CaoYi'ou,KangSheng's wife,submittedasecondreportonbehalfoftheworkteamonJune21,chargingthat"this entire incident was an ambush carried out against us jointly by en-emieswithin theschool andoutsidetocreatechaos anddisrupt ourbat-tle plan.”ChenBoda,head of the CCRG,met with theBeida workteamon June 27 and charged that an “underground headquarters” of Lu Pingloyalists was behind the event, trying to save themselves by discreditingtheCulturalRevolution.12BecauseofChen'spressurefurtherinvestigations were pursued, and eventually twenty-four persons were censuredfor beating people.The next work-team report called the struggle ses-SourcesofOpposition andConflict

Counterattacks were un-necessary atBeida,however,becausethe workteamfacednoseriouschal-lenge.The attacks against targeted officials continued,but struggle ses-sions were generally conducted under the supervision of the work team.On June 22 and 23 Lu Ping and Peng Peiyun, the top officials named in theMay 25 wall poster, were put through two days of mass struggle sessions.By late June 230 cadres and teachers had been targeted; 153 were “dis-missed from office by the masses,”192 were put through struggle sessions,94 were beaten, and 107 were paraded with tall hats.14Withthebackingof CCRGradicals andnodissentfrom theuniversity"leftists"” on the work-team staff, opposition was effectively squelched.This changed after Mao returned to Beijing on July 18 and expresseddissatisfaction with the way in which work teams had handled the move-ment.Heconvenedaseriesofmeetingswithmembersof theCCRGandother officials over the next few days, complaining angrily that workteamshadblockedstudentmobilization.Itwasobviousthattheywouldsoon be withdrawn, and Mao finally gave the order on July 21.15Mao's lieutenants quickly backtracked, especially Chen Boda, CaoYi'ou, and Kang Sheng, who had pushed for a harder line on the June 18 in-cident. As they rushed to reverse their positions, Zhang Chengxian wasmade a scapegoat for the “serious errors" of the work team. Once thischange of course was made clear to individuals at Beida, opposition tothe work team finally emerged, but from within, once again in the formof a denunciation by Nie Yuanzi. Zhang Chengxian could sense the shift-ing tide the week before. On July 16 he held a mass meeting to offer aself-criticismandcorrecttheworkteam'searlierstanceontheJune18incident. On July 17 and 18 Zhang and other members of the work teamgave additional speeches in which they emphasized that June 18 actuallywas a “revolutionary incident,” and they encouraged students to writewall posters and criticize.16 It was only then that Nie Yuanzi denouncedher colleagues. In a speech on the evening of July 19 she accused the workteam of “errors of orientation and line."17Once again, members of the CCRG intervened directly in school poli-tics.

In his speech KangSheng said that students should organize their own leadership group.Most who spoke supported the claim that the verdict on June 18 was anerror,althoughavocalminorityofstudentsdefendedtheworkteamandsaid that the earlier verdict was not wrong.19A larger CCRG delegation returned on July 26.20 The atmosphere wastense, the accusations were more extreme, and students who argued inZhang'sdefensewereemotional.Afterseveralhours,ChenBodacon-cluded the meeting by saying that the work team had obstructed the massmovement and should be withdrawn. Jiang Qing recommended that aCultural Revolution committee lead the movement, and she nominatedNieYuanzi tohead theeffort.Two dayslater a preparatory committeewas elected with Nie as the chairman.21 The work team was deposed anddenouncedby the same officialswhohad earlier urged aharsher stanceon the June 18 incident.22

Beijing Industrial UniversityThe first work team at Beijing Industrial University left the party com-mittee in charge, but it encountered strong resistance and had to be re-placed. The second work team completely reversed political directionand led a harrowing purge of the school's leadership that even questionedthe political reliability of many ordinary party members. Its militant stanceandthemilitaryandrevolutionarycredentialsofDuWanrong,theheadof the second work team, ensured that it faced no serious opposition, butits relations with some of the leading opponents of the first work teamwere strained. This did not create overt opposition, but it laid the ground-workforfactionsaftertheworkteamwithdrewandtransferredpowertostudents in early August.These tensions were muted during June and July. In the extensive docu-mentation of the later debates about this second work team's activities,there is no mention of open opposition, nor were there any subsequentcomplaints that the work teamfailed to investigate the school power struc-ture thoroughly, or that it retaliated against opponents. The political ten-Sources of Opposition and Conflict

65sions did not surface until after the work team's withdrawal, when a groupof students challenged classmates left in charge by the second work team.2The most outspoken opponents of the first work team were party mem-bers and political activists from revolutionary cadre households. Despitefavored positions in the power structure,they challenged the workteam's soft line toward the school's party leadership. The first work teamleveled charges of political disloyalty at this initial group of activists. Whenthe second work team arrived, these activists apparently expected thatthe charges against them would be repudiated and that they would berecognized as the most politically advanced militants in the school. Theywere disappointed.Intent on resuming thestalled purge of the school lead-ership, the new work team deflected demands to investigate the first one.Resisting pressure from these early activists, the new work team turned tomore responsive students, many of whom had not opposed the first workteam or who had even cooperated with it.Quietly appalled that the second work team ignored the risks they hadtaken intheir earlyrebellion and insteadrecruited obedient activists regardless of their earlier stance, these militant students were passed over.Furthermore, because many of them had come from families with impec-cable revolutionary backgrounds, they felt that the second work teamwas violating the party's class line and was instead recruiting obedientconformists regardless of political background. Months later they criti-cized the work team for ignoring their family heritage:As forDuWanrong's classline...[the]standard was:whether ornot youobeyedwhat theworkteamsaid.[AttheJune 21speechtoworker,peasant,and revolutionary cadre offspring, he said] if you do not listen to what thework team says,even if you are from a worker, peasant, or revolutionarycadre background, you will be attacked just the same, and be expelled ..:On the other hand,thosefrom bad classbackground,the so-called“leftists”who obey what the work team says, will be relied on.24This work team's militant purge of the power structure and its clear warn-ingsagainstoppositionfromstudentsregardlessoftheirpoliticalcredentials cowed these bypassed activists into sullen compliance. The resent-ments surfaced immediately after the work team's departure,however,when these students challenged the activists left in charge by the secondwork team. The struggle between the two nascent factions generated afamous but widely misinterpreted speech in defense of the second workteam that will be examined in the next chapter.

Beijing Agricultural UniversityThe work team at Beijing Agricultural University pursued a mixed strat-egy that divided the school's power structure against itself. For almosttwoweeksbeforetheworkteam'sJune13arrival,accusationsagainstParty Secretary Wang Guanlan and his close associates on the party com-mittee appeared in wall posters, and some of the most prominent criticswere middle-level cadres in the school.25 Before the work team arrived,Wang deflected criticism by announcing a campaign to investigate bour-geois professors, and he relied on loyal party branch secretaries to makecounteraccusations againsthis criticsThe work team realized that this approach was insuffciently militant,and it initiated a thorough purge of the power structure. However, it de-creed that Wang Guanlan and one of his deputies were politically reliableand would remain in their posts. The ensuing campaign took its heaviesttoll on the party apparatus immediately below the party standing com-mittee.CadreswhohadearlierpostedcriticismsofWangbecame apar-ticular focus of the campaign and found themselves charged with anti-party activity. However, the purge was so extensive that many of thosewho had earlier defended the party secretary by making counteraccusa-tions against his critics were also charged with following a “black line"in the school. This was widely interpreted as a cynical attempt by WangGuanlantosavehimselfbysacrificingloyalsubordinates.Thiscreatedtwo distinct categories of cadres and party members who harbored stronggrievancesagainstthepartysecretaryandtheworkteam:loyaldefenderswho were sacrificed in thepurge,and critics whohad dared to expose hiserrorsbeforethe arrivaloftheworkteam.The resentments did not find organized expression until after the workteam left.There waslittle overt opposition during the work team's stay,and it responded rapidly and effectively against dissent. At a mass rallyon June 18, for example, a group of students from one department criti-cized Party Secretary Wang. The department's general branch secretarywas immediately stripped of his post, as was the class counselor in chargeof the students who made the criticisms.When the students organizedtoresist,the minister of agriculture,Tan Zhenlin,went to the school anddeclared that Wang Guanlan was a revolutionary leftist and the work teamwouldnotbewithdrawn.Theminister'sinterventionwaseffective:theworkteamkepttheparty secretary in power as it resumed its purge of the power structure.

Sources of Opposition and ConflictSubsequent accounts written by victims do not describe significant opposi-tion. Those who supported the work team and the party secretary and de-nounced their colleagues were promoted to replace them. When the workteam withdrew at the end of July, Party Secretary Wang was still in office.He was soon challenged by two different categories ofpeople whonowfound common cause: critics who had been purged in retaliation, and loyaldefenders who had been sacrificed in the purge.

ContestedControlAlthough pacified campuses represent a broad range of work-team types,alltheschoolswherecontrolwascontestedhadradicalworkteams.De-spite their militant stance, these work teams found it necessary to con-duct a broad campaign against students who called for their removal.These conflicts were not about the targets of the purges or its scope, butabout the work team's ability to control the process. Two of these schools,Qinghua University and Beijing Normal University, played a major role inthe subsequentred guard movement and will be described here,alongwiththe Beijing Foreign Languages Institute.26

QinghuaUniversityQinghua University's radical work team had firm control of the campusduring its entire stay, but it encountered stubborn opposition from anoutspokengroupof students whochafed atrestrictions on their activi-ties.These tensions escalated in the third weekofJune,when the workteam decided to counterattack. The conflict produced one of the most in-fluential student leaders of the Cultural Revolution, Kuai Dafu, who playeda key role in Beijing politics for the next two years.Kuai Dafu was an entirely different kind of leader from Beida's NieYuanzi. Nie was a cadre in the party establishment, but Kuai, 20, was athird-year student of chemical engineering who had not yet joined theparty.27 Kuai was nonetheless closely associated with the regime and theuniversity power structure.He was a youth league member,a politicalactivist, and a student cadre in his class.He came from a “red"house-hold: both parents were party members who had joined after 1949. Kuaihad already earned a measure of political fame. When he was a freshmanin the fall of 1963, his photograph was featured in the national magazinePeople's Illustrated as a model of the party's increasing emphasis on

TheGenesisofDivision68

admitting students from a proletarian background toleading universi-ties.28 He took his political commitments very seriously. Shortly after hisdebutinthemedia,hewrotealettertotheStandingCommitteeoftheNational People's Congress exposing the extravagant lifestyles of cadresin his rural hometown.29 At the outset of the Cultural Revolution,Kuaiwas head of his classroom's Cultural Revolution group, and it was fromthis position of leadership that he launched his challenge to the workteam.Qinghua's work team did not arrive until the evening of June 9, a fullweek after Nie Yuanzi's wall poster was publicized. In the interim, theuniversity's party secretary, Jiang Nanxiang, tried to fend off mountingaccusations that he was part of the same “black gang” that includedBeida's leaders. Wall posters critical of Jiang appeared on June 2 andtouched off counterattacks by students whodenied the charges.KuaiDafu put uphis first wall poster critical of the party committee on June3.A number of the authors of anti-Jiang posters were forced to makeself-criticisms. The school was reportedly shocked on June 4 when LiuTao, one of Liu Shaoqi's daughters, signed a “revolutionary” wall poster,and she and the son of Marshall He Long signed another wall poster thenextdaythatcriticizedJiang'sdefensivenessandpassivity.OnJune7Kuai formed a “combat team” with twelve classmates and put up a wallposter that declared an anti-Jiang stand. Party committee loyalists coun-terattacked against the critics.30 When the work team arrived, the entireparty leadership was immediately deposed, and all cadres stood aside forinvestigation.KuaiDafu'sinitialstancewas completelyalignedwiththeworkteam.Why, then, did Kuai develop into an outspoken work-team opponent?Qinghua'sworkteamwasthemostmilitantinthecity,andits assault onthe school power structure was uncompromising.

Instead, its complaintswereabouthowtoconducttheassault,andwhether theworkteamhadauthority over the student fighting groups that were forming in the class-rooms.InlessthantwoweeksKuaimovedfromenthusiasmaboutthework team to strident opposition. This rapid evolution shows how fac-tions formed out of a series of political interactions rather than from in-terests inherent in the positions of individuals before the Cultural Revolu-tion, and so it is worth examining these interactions in some detail.When the work team arrived on the evening of June 9 and announcedthe purge of Jiang Nanxiang and the overthrow of the party committee,

69

SourcesofOpposition andConflictKuaiDafu andhiscombatteamwere overjoyed.Thenextmorning,how-ever, Kuai began to have second thoughts. The first thing that botheredKuai was the way in which erstwhile defenders of the party committeeimmediatelychanged their tune aftertheworkteam's arrival.“From theevening of June 9 to the morning of June 10, former hard-core conserva-tives suddenly‘mutinied’ overnight, rising up everywhere to give speechessaying‘we were deceived.' On the 10th and 11th,‘dog-beating teams’ cameout of one department after another, and a lot of dogs were beaten untilthey were utterly routed and ran off with their tails between their legs."31AlthoughKuai was suspicious,the about-face of theparty committee'sdefenders was exactly what was expected of loyal party members and po-litical activists. When a change in party line is pronounced, members areexpected to fall in line without asking questions. This was what hap-pened at Qinghua (and other universities), and the party views such be-havior as a sign of loyalty, not duplicity. Those who had recently taken astance now deemed incorrect in fact bore a special burden to show theirloyaltytothenewlinethroughdecisiveaction.The day after the work team arrived, Kuai led an attempt to seize thecontrol room of his dormitory's public address system and fought brieflywithyouthleagueleaderswhoarrivedlatertotakeoveronbehalfofthework team.Students inhis classroom criticized his rash actions:“In seizing power we had lost the trust that our group had."32 An even greatersource of friction was the attempts of groups like Kuai's to organize theirown struggle sessions.An early example was a certain student who putup“anextremelyreactionarywallposter.”Kuai complained,“Whenwetriedtodragthisactivecounterrevolutionaryoutofthedormitorytotheclassroomsfor astrugglesession,comradesfromtheworkteamstoppedus...Wewanttoasktheworkteam:whydoyounotpermitustostruggle against a counterrevolutionary,while permittinghis wall poster widecirculation?...We resolutely demand that the work team release [theauthor] for an all-school mass struggle session."33Kuai observed that during its first week at Qinghua the work team hadreined in mass action. First, it organized so many meetings that studentshad no time to conduct their own activities. When students demandedstruggle sessions,they were accused of being“too subjective."Wewant tohold strugglesessionsbutyouwillnot approve.Wewant tograb hold of a big black gang, put a hat on him and parade him around, youstop us...You say,talk about it here,discuss it there,what kind of struggle

TheGenesisofDivision70

is this? .. . Every department organizes dog-beating squads, looking every-where for dogs to beat. You say this is attacking on too broad a front ...Previously we risked having our heads chopped off and carried out a strug-gle with the conservative party, and now we lift up our heads and curse theblack gang, but our public address system and [work team head] Ye Lin's re-port repeatedly emphasize,“Do not curse people,”and struggle sessionsand parading people are not permitted; we cannot even curse people.Wewould liketo ask thework team:is there aninstruction of thePartyCenteragainstcursingpeople?34Instead,the work team was always counseling the students to calmdown, think things through, gather evidence, and investigate things thor-oughly, and this only served as abarrier tothe revolutionary actions of themasses.The work team,Kuai argued,used the slogan “Everyone is equalbeforethe truth”as aweapon against them.The work team's leaders repeatedly say that the truth is in our hands, politi-cal power is in our hands. We should stress facts and reason things out, fullylay out our reasons,and theywillnaturallylose their arrogance.Theyusethis to block us from holding struggle sessions, do not let us parade people,and even use this toblock usfrom holding amass struggle session against anactive counterrevolutionary...Now we havelifted up our heads,but thework team is always saying we should stick to facts and be reasonable. Buttruthhas aclassnature.We aretalking aboutproletarian truth.Can theygetthis through their skulls? If you do not strike at reactionaries, you cannotoverthrow them. Toward class enemies you can only adopt dictatorship.35Kuai was particularly angry about the attitudes of some of the workteam's members toward militant students. One cadre, trying to persuadestudents to halt a struggle session, said, “The consciousness of you col-lege students is really low, you do not have any head for politics . ..Youareconsideredhigh-levelintellectuals,butyourmethodsarenotatallhighlevel; you do not understand party policy."”Even worse, he questionedwhether Mao's classic essay “Report on the Peasant Movement in Hu-nan" should be taken by students as a guide to university politics in the1960s: “Putting a tall hat on someone is the Nationalist's way of doingthings; peasants can do it this way, but you should not; this just showsyour incompetence ... Doing things this way only shows how cruel youare,it showsyou reallyhave not studied the Chairman's worksvery wellatall."36SourcesofOppositionandConflict

71Kuai was outraged. “"We can hardly imagine that such talk came out ofa work-teammember,cursingthe masseslike this.Wewould like to tellthis comrade, if you curse us, we do not mind; if you curse our poor andlower-middle class peasants,we will not respond.But if you curse ourgreat leader Chairman Mao, we will defy you to the death!"37 Kuai andhiscomradesexpressedthesecomplaintsforcefullyinawallpostertheyput up on June 16, less than one week after the work team's arrival.38Kuai was part of a vocal minority that posed no immediate threat totheQinghua work team,but there was a danger thattheir argumentsmight attract support. This was happening on many other campuseswherethefirstwaveofworkteamshadalreadybeenchasedawayfromcampus and a second wave was still struggling to quell strong opposi-tion.TwodayslatertheJune18incidentatBeidaconvincedmanyinthenational leadership that it was time to take a stand.Unfortunately forKuai,his forceful criticisms of the work team were viewed as part of alarger political threat, even though Kuai had little influence at QinghuaKuaisoondrewattentiontohimselfinaninadvertentlyspectacularfashion. While he was reading campus wall posters on June 19, he raninto a senior official talking to a group of students. The cadre arguedthat the work team's actions were entirely correct.Kuai overheard thisand could not restrain himself. He challenged the cadre and argued withhim, showing no deference. He wondered aloud who “this old fat guy"was.Other studentsjumpedin on the senior cadre's side,and after someforty minutes the official stalked off, clearly irritated. Four days laterKuai was informed that the “old fat guy” was in fact Party Vice-ChairmanBoYibo,whowasinchargeofworkteamsinschoolsunder theindustryandtransportationsystem.39After this exchange the work team's attitude hardened. On June 22.as he was about to convene a meeting,Kuai was informed that WangGuangmei, the wife of Liu Shaoqi,wanted to attend his group's meet-ing.40 The students were excited, but in the end an unidentified middle-aged woman attended and said little. During the meeting Kuai and hiscomradesexpressedfurthercriticismsoftheworkteam.Attheendofthemeeting they asked for the visitor's name,and it turned out she was notWang Guangmei, but someone who would only identify herself as a staffmemberinthework-teamoffice.Kuai andhiscomradeswereoutragedand they ran to the work-team offices and demanded to know why WangGuangmei had not shown up.They got few answers and waited most ofthe day.When theyfinally met with several officials,the exchanges were

tense and disrespectful. Kuai and his comrades concluded that WangGuangmei had sent her secretary to spy on them.41The next day the atmosphere suddenly changed. Wall posters attackedKuai, and another student who had made accusations against the workteam was denounced for anti-party sentiments.OnJune 24 wall postersattacked Kuai, and he was forced to debate his critics.At a mass debateabout his opposition to the work team on June 25,several speakers denounced him.42 In a last-ditch attempt to prevent being framed as anti-party“rightists,”Kuai Dafu and his comrades left campus for two daysof fruitless attempts to lodge appeals at central party and government of-fices. When Kuai finally returned to campus, the campaign against himand “Kuai-type figures" was in full swing. The work team linked Kuaiwith the anti-work-team movement on other campuses and denouncedKuai and his supporters in its published collections of wall posters.43 Inlong speeches at mass debates held on June 27,Kuai defended himselfagainst accusations that he was anti-party and vigorously disputed dis-tortionsofhisactionsandideas.Healsocontinuedtowritewallpostersand was free to walk on campus.44On July 3 Kuai encountered Vice-Premier BoYibo on campus onceagain, and this time Bo heatedly lectured Kuai. Bo pointed out that thework team, not Kuai, had seized power from the party committee, butnowKuaiwanted toseizepower from theworkteam:“KuaiDafu nowis always thinking of seizing power, seizing power from the CommunistParty ... There is a bit of the diehard spirit of counterrevolution." Bowasstillsmartingfromhisearlier encounterwithKuai:“Iwilltellyousomething, that guy is arrogant.He said I was a fat old man. I admit I amold,butI donotlikebeingfat.”Bosaid that thelasttimehehad seenKuaihe had told him that he should admit his errors,“but he just ignored it,the guy is arrogant.” “Today I speak not on my qualifications as a fat oldman,but as an ordinary person,”Bo said.“Comrades,do not overesti-mate Kuai Dafu. If you overestimate him, you are being fooled. He is justa lackey frantically running around, he has no ability. We on the leftmust drag out the true black line; do not look on him as something spe-cial." As Bo was leaving, he turned to Kuai and said, “Kuai Dafu, I havedoneyouafavor,Ihavetreatedyou asacontradictionamongthepeopleIf we struggle with you, that is a real contradiction. But with class ene-mies we do things differently.We struggle with class enemies,exercisedictatorship, arrest people." Then, turning to the other students, he said,"In the future, when you struggle with him, do not give him a big label,

73

Sources of Opposition and Conflictand do not beat him. Learn from this teacher by negative example. Thisis a lesson in politics. "45The same day as his harrowing encounter with BoYibo,Kuai wrote awall poster to protest the fact that he was now being restricted to cam-pus, and that his letters were being intercepted and opened by the workteam.OnJuly 4 he put up a wall poster protesting these circumstancesand declaring a hunger strike. For the next eighteen days he was confinedto his dormitory, and his contacts with comrades were cut off. He wasstripped of his youth league membership and leadership post. In the cam-paign against “Kuai-type figures,”around 50 students were given dam-aging political labels, and another 700 students were forced to make self-criticisms for expressing views similar to, or in sympathy with, Kuai's.46Kuairemainedinisolationwhiletheworkteamcontinuedattacksagainst the Qinghua power structure,but afterMao ordered the with-drawal of work teams, Kuai was transformed from a counterrevolution-ary to a victim of an erroneous political line. On the morning of July 22,two members of the CCRG visited Kuai and talked with him for threehours, and they told the work team's leaders that their treatment of Kuaiwaswrong.47OnJuly28work-teamheadYeLin announced at a massmeeting thatthe work team would soon leave and a preparatory committee would beformed to lead the school.48 Between July 30 and August 3, as the prepara-tory committee was being formed, Zhou Enlai visited the campus severaltimes to talkwith thework team's leaders andvisitKuai.OnAugust 4Zhou chaired a mass meeting during whichYe Lin gave a self-criticismon behalf of the work team. Zhou questioned the conduct of the workteam and stated that he had been sent by Chairman Mao and the PartyCenter to announce the rehabilitation of Kuai Dafu and others who hadbeen similarly punished.49

BeijingNormal UniversityEvents at Beijing Normal University were influenced by a direct connec-tion between a prominent activist in the school and radical figures closetoMao.This connectionwasthroughTanHoulan,afifth-yearstudentinthe Political Education Department who,like NieYuanzi and Kuai Dafu.later emerged as one of Beijing's key red guard leaders.50 Tan was twenty-nine years old; she had previously worked in elementary schools and hadestablished strong credentials as a model party member. As a reward fon

TheGenesisofDivision74

her strong political record she was admitted to Beijing Normal, the na-tion's leading teachers’ college, as a “cadre transfer student." In January1966 Tan was given a prestige assignment by her department's generalbranch secretary:shewould work as an intern at the Central Committee'sleading theoretical journal, Red Flag. The journal was a hotbed of radicalMaoist activity and was a major force in the launching and subsequent di-rection of the Cultural Revolution. The journal's editor-in-chief was ChenBoda,wholaterbecamethechairmanof theCCRG,andfourRedFlagvice-editors—GuanFeng,MuXin,Qi Benyu,andWangLi—became mem-bers. Tan Houlan worked directly under Lin Jie, a graduate of Beijing Nor-mal who later played an important staff role on the CCRG.51Tan's first act of rebellion was similar to NieYuanzi's: with higher-levelbacking she attacked the party secretary of her university.Late in the eve-ning of June 1, a few hours after Nie Yuanzi's “first Marxist-Leninist wallposter”waspraisedinradiobroadcasts,TanlefttheRedFlagofficesforthe campus and put up a wall poster accusing her school's party secretaryof similar political errors.More wall posters followed, and the campus wasshortly in an uproar. On June 4 the school's party secretary was removedfrom all posts, and on June 6 a work team headed by Sun Youyu, vice-minister oftheFirstMinistry ofMachineBuilding,tookover theschool.Also like Nie Yuanzi, Tan Houlan cooperated with the work team dur-ing much of its stay. The work team conducted a radical purge of thepower structure, but it encountered vocal opposition that led to a June19wallposter callingforitsdeparture.Oneofthemainissueswas thatthe former party secretary had left the school, and the work team refusedto bring him back for interrogation and struggle sessions. Tan Houlanactively supported the work team after the initial challenges on June 20,writingawallpostertopraisetheworkteam'smilitantperformanceandorganizingademonstrationtoexpress theloyalsupportof“revolution-ary students.”After this act Tan wasrecalled to theRedFlag officesforconsultation, and she returned to campus on June 22 to reverse her ear-lier position, putting up a wall poster questioning the work team's harshresponsetoitscritics.TheworkteamthenattackedTanHoulanandherfollowers, putting work-team head Sun Youyu on a collision course withMaoistradicalsontheCCRG.52The work team's campaign against “fake leftists” was unusually harsh.The authors of the June 19 wall poster that touched off the furor were putthrough struggle sessions during which they were punched and kicked,asweremanyoftheseveralhundredsympathizerstheyclaimedinthe

Sources of Opposition and Conflictschool. The work team investigated the backgrounds and activities of the“fake leftists”and put materials into their personal files.The primary au-thor of the critical wall poster was stripped of his position in his depart-ment's core leadership group and labeled a “rightist."53 Sun Youyu wasaware of theconnectionbetweenTanHoulan and LinJie,and throughLinJie to Chen Boda and the CCRG, and protested the group's role in sup-porting what he considered anti-party activities in letters to Kang Shengandothers.54Sun's complaints implied that radicals on the CCRG were engaged inundergroundfactionalactivitiesthatcouldbeconstruedasanti-party,andthere was a swift and severe response. Kang Sheng and members of theCCRG met with Sun on July 13, gave him a severe dressing-down, and or-dered him to make a self-criticism in front of the entire school.55 Sun re-fused, and as a result Beijing's party vice-secretary Wu De went to theschool on July 16, criticized Sun Youyu, announced his replacement, calledthe stance of Tan Houlan and other critics of the work team “correct,” andasked students to back the new work-team leader.56After Sun Youyu's removal Tan Houlan's group quickly returned to itsearlierstanceofloyalsupportfortheworkteam.Vindicatedaftertheinpatrons on the CCRGretaliated against Sun,they felt secure in their po-sitions.Thiswasnottrueoftheothervictimsoftheworkteam,whodidnot have such close ties with national politicians. Tan Houlan argued fora relatively conservative course:loyalty to the work team and trust in thenew Beijing Municipal Party Committee. Others who had been branded“fake leftists” were not mollified merely by the appointment of a newwork-teamleader.They calledforcriticismoftheworkteam'serrorsoverthe previous weeks and for driving the work team off the campus.57 By thetime the withdrawal of all work teams was announced at the end of Julystudents at theuniversity were split into three groups:those whohad co-operated with the work team under SunYouyu and two groups of Sun'sopponents, one allied with Tan Houlan that supported the new work-team head, and another that had refused to be pacified by a mere leader-shipchange.

unleashed student activists on school officials.58 Within a week, however,hewasstrugglingtomaintaincontrolovertheescalatingattacks.Ener-gized by the new work team's permissive attitude, students organizedstruggle sessions and decided that they should unilaterally determine whichdepartmental cadres had a revolutionary standpoint and which were reac-tionary. Many departments proceeded to elect departmental revolutionarycommittees and circulated the slogan “All power to the revolutionary com-mittees."The work team launched a campaign to regain control on June 24. Onework-team cadre asserted that the work team represented theParty Cen-ter, and to oppose it was mistaken.He argued that Mao's 1927 “ReportonthePeasantMovementinHunan"—thetemplateforviolentstrugglesessions as a form of protestwas“passe."”The students responsible forstruggle sessions were criticized for recklessness and political confusion,and thosewhocontinued tochallengetheworkteam'sauthorityweresub-jected to criticism meetings and struggle sessions.In the following weeks the work team pressured almost 9o0 studentsinto self-criticisms. Figures compiled two months later revealed a commonpattern:thework team's main challengerswerepolitically active studentsclosely associated with the power structure. Two-thirds of them were from“"red” households, and over 80 percent were party or youth league mem-bers. Of those targeted for opposition, 35 percent were student cadres wholost leadership posts in their classrooms or on party and youth leaguebranch committees.59 During this period cadres who specialized in politi-cal investigations compiled dossiers on “persons of emphasis,” interro-gated them and their associates, analyzed their wall posters,read theirdiaries, and visited their families. The intense pressures brought to bearduring interrogations and criticism meetings left many despondent and sui-cidal because they realized that their futures now appeared to be ruined.When the work team was abruptly withdrawn at the end of July, thevictims seized the opportunity to reverse their misfortune and mobilizedto overthrow students placed in positions of leadership on the school'spreparatorycommittee.

BeijingAeronauticsInstituteWork-team head Zhao Ruzhang reversed his conservative course after itbecame clear that internal opposition was widespread.61 Despite his rad-ical assault on the party organization, he soon met resistance over howhe was conducting the campaign. Zhao's first misstep was to designatemiddle-levelcadres as themainforcein the accusationsagainsttopschoolleaders, because they had inside information that students did not have.Student activists complained that they were being sidelined. The secondproblem was that political instructors and student cadres who had donethe bidding of the party organization in the past were targets of the cam-paign, but many of these people were now leading the charge against thetop party leadership.This led to accusations that the work team was “in-citing students to struggle against students”todivert attentionfrom thetop officials. The third problem was over student-initiated struggle ses-sions. Work-team attempts to curtail them led to resentment. The finalproblemwas insufficient studentrepresentation on the CulturalRevolu-tioncommittee.62These frictions bred opposition to the work team. Zhao was nowfighting a political battle on two fronts. He tried to win support from thestudentsbypushingamilitantpurgeofthepowerstructurewhilemov-ing to silence those who challenged the work team's authority. Zhao's op-ponentswere encouraged by news thatwork teams at many other schoolshadretreatedindefeat,andtheypushedtheir advantage.OnJune20sev-eral large delegations of students went separately to the State Council, theNational Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the MunicipalParty Committee to lodge complaints against the work team.63 A provoca-tive wall poster appeared on June 21, leveling an accusation directly atZhao Ruzhang: if there was a “black line” in the school, did it really havenoleader?Zhao,after all,was directlyin charge of theinstitute.Theim-plicationwasthathewastryingtocontrolthemovementtoprotecthimself.OnJune25theworkteambeganitscounterattack,orchestratingcriticism meetings against its most outspoken opponents.

ZhaoRuzhang announced that the work team would retreat to an “advisory"role, and the work team appointed a preparatory committee of twelvemassrepresentatives,allfrom theCulturalRevolution committeeelectedthe previous month.The committee was immediately challenged by thecritics of the work team who had been silenced in the previous weeks, andthis challenge led directly to the two opposing red guard factions thatformedduringthefirstdaysofAugust.

BeijingGeologyInstituteThe work team at the Beijing Geology Institute also shifted from a con-servative to a radical stance,but this failed to quell a strong oppositionmovement.65 During struggle sessions organized by students, members ofthe school's party committee defended themselves by saying that theyhad acted on orders of theMinistry of Geology.Students saw this as evi-dence that there was a “black gang” in the ministry itself. Members ofthe work team argued that political problems in the school were limitedto the campus, and they tried to redirect the students’ attention to GaoYuangui, the institute's president and party secretary. These students al-ready had suspicions about the ministry's party secretary, He Chang-gong, who had earlier tried to dampen criticisms of the institute's lead-ers.Now they felt that the work team was diverting their attack onto GaoYuangui in order to prevent them from fully investigating political prob-lems in the ministry. During the next several days wall posters criticized theworkteam.Matters came to a head on June 20. Early that morning several schoolofficials delivered awrittencomplaint totheState Council,criticizing thework team's conduct and calling for its withdrawal. The group was ledby Li Gui, a preliberation party member, formerly head of campus secu-rity.LiGui'sstandwasapplaudedbystudentscriticaloftheworkteam.After Li and his group returned to campus, he delivered a speech that de-scribed the contents of his complaint. Students cheered his stand, put upwall posters supporting“Li Gui's revolutionary act,”and organized a

They called for returning power overthe school's movement to genuine leftists in the institute.66Li Guididnotleave awrittenrecordofhismotives,buthehadahis-tory of conflict with party vice-secretaries of the school who were coop-eratingwiththeworkteam'splantolaytheblameforalltheinstitute'spolitical problems on GaoYuangui.67 Gao had joined the party in thelate 1930s as a student radical in the anti-Japanese movement at ChinaUniversity in Beijing. He later joined the Communist Party and served inguerilla base areas during the Japanese occupation. His revolutionarycredentials were well known in the school.68In the course of the move-ment students learned that Gao had not always followed He Chang-gong's directives, and that the latter resented his headstrong subordinate.He Changgong had an even more distinguished record as a guerilla fighterbeginning in the 1920s, when he served with Mao in his first base area inJinggangshan.69 Li Gui's rebellion and the controversy over Gao Yuanguidrew the schoolinto theministry's internalpolitics.Events at the school threatened to spin out of control just asthePartyCenter was reacting to Beida's June 18 incident. The ministry decided tointervene. On June 21 He Changgong returned to the campus with Vice-Minister Xu Guangyi and an even higher-ranking official,Li Renlin.vice-head of the political department of the State Council Industry andTransportation Department.70 He Changgong certified that the work teamwas “revolutionary,” and Li Renlin backed him up. Vice-Minister XuGuangyi referred to the student opposition as “a disturbance created bya small minority."71 On June 22 Li Renlin relayed an instruction he hadreceived from his direct superior, Bo Yibo,who repeated the same pointshehadmadeorallytoKuaiDafuatQinghuaUniversityonJune19:thework team represented the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, andseizing power from the work team was therefore anti-party.72BoYibo's attempt to shore up the work team served only to split thecampus further. Students opposed to the work team now put up wallposters directly critical of the officials who had come to campus to silencethem.During the next three days hundreds of wall posters criticized theleaders’actions andquestioned their motives.Some called for turningover control to the Cultural Revolution committees established in the de-partments andpermitting themtoindependently run the school's cam-paign.73OnJune 25 the counterattack began.The school'spublic address system broadcast Bo Yibo's directive against opposing work teams, and the

work team rallied its supporters for an“anti-interference campaign.”HeChanggong and Xu Guangyi returned to the campus to give speechesFor the next three weeks the work team,with broad participation by po-litically active students, led a campaign to prevent “anti-party elements"from obstructing the work team. Li Gui and the group of cadres who haddemanded the withdrawal of the work team were designated an“under-ground anti-party headquarters” and became the primary targets of massstruggle sessions. “Special case groups” built case files against more thanninetycadresandteacherswhohadsympathizedwithcallsfortheworkteam's withdrawal.In departments where opposition to the work teamwas strong, party and youth league branches were reorganized, and manystudent cadres were stripped of their posts.74OneofthefocalpointsofthecampaignwastheSurveyDepartmentwhose Cultural Revolution committee openly opposed the work team.The committee was disbanded,and five out of seven members of theparty general branch committee were removed from their posts; all tenpartybranchsecretaries were replaced,aswerelarge numbers of studentcadres.Out of 494 students in the department,352 were compelled tomake a self-criticism, 50 were criticized by name in wall posters, and 39were labeled participants in a “black gang.” Of 93 teachers and cadres,44werecriticizedinwallposters,and10weresubjectedtostruggleses-sions. Opposition to the work team ran deep in the power structure it-self: 34 of the 44 teachers and cadres who were criticized in wall posterswere party members, and of the 10 opponents of the work team sub-jected to struggle sessions, 9 were party members and 7 were cadres.75Figures for the GeologyInstitute as a whole are similar.The campaignstruck hard against people who were predominantly part of or close tothe power structure.Atotalof 435peoplewereforced tomake self-criticisms,andmaterialsdocumentingtheirpoliticalerrorswerecom-piled and placed in the files of 125 of them. The majority of the workteam's opponents were from groups previously favored by the powerstructure.More thanhalfofthemwerefrom“red"familybackgroundsand two-thirds were party or youth league members. Almost all of the 66people wholost positions of authority in the campaign were from a"red”household (80 percent）or were members of the party or youthleague (88 percent).76 The campaign against the work team's opponentslaid the foundation for a vigorous movement to overthrow the prepara-tory committee left in charge after the work team left.Because they hadalready clashed directly with ministry officials,these activistsharboredSources of Opposition and Conflict

Beijing Post and Telecommunications InstituteMinistry officials were drawn even more directly into conflicts in the Bei-jing Post and Telecommunications Institute. The institute's first workteam, led by the head of the Education Department of the Ministry offPost and Telecommunications,lasted only four days.It left the party com-mitteeincharge,anditsmembersorchestratedcounterattacksagainstcritics of top school officials that began before the work team arrived. Thesecond work team, led by the head of the ministry's Political Department,arrived on June 8, quickly deposed the party committee, and made allleading cadres stand asidefor investigation.77Accusations against criticsof the party committee were halted.The second work team's radical stancefailed to satisfy those whohadbeen criticized the previous week. On June 11 students went to the min-istry's offices and put up a wall poster demanding that the first workteam's head return to the school to reply to their charges about the con-duct of his work team. The next morning more than fifty studentsmarched to the ministry, put up another wall poster, this time denounc-ing a vice-minister as well, and demanded that he return to the schoolalong with the first work team's head to answer to charges.On June 13students began to call openlyfor the withdrawalof the second workteam in favor of teachers and students running their school's own Cul-tural Revolution without supervision. The ministry's party secretary,Wang Zigang, called a hasty meeting of the party committee and decidedto send the first work team's head back to the school to give a self-criticism.On June 14 Secretary Wang returned to the institute with Tao Lujia, vice-chairman of the State Economic Commission, to observe the movement.78Taodeclaredhisconfidencethatthesecondworkteamwasrevolutionary, and for that matter, so was the leadership of the ministry's partycommittee.Apparentlyconcludingthatthedisturbancesattheinstitutewouldnotbe quelled until student demands were met, the ministry's party commit-tee sacrificed Zhao Zhigang, the fourth-ranking vice-minister, alreadydenounced by students in connection with the first work team.On June

On June 19 Secretary Wang Zigangand First Vice-Secretary Zhong Fuxiang went personally to the institutetoputupawallposterdenouncingZhao.The ministry's leaders caved in so quickly that the militant students be-camesuspicious.OnJune20agroupoffortymarchedbacktothemin-istry and put up wall posters questioning the motives behind the denun-ciation of Zhao Zhigang by his superiors.Were the top officials onlyseeking to sacrifice Zhao toprotect themselves? On June 21 the min-istry's party committee announced that the institute's president would bedismissed from all posts,but this served only to multiply the numberof wall posters targeting the ministry's party secretary, Wang Zigang. OnJune23morethan200studentsmarchedtotheministry'sofficestocalloutSecretaryWang Zigangfor a debate.Theywere told that hewas in ameeting, which they refused to believe. They staked out the ministry,chanting for him to come out. One hour later Wang emerged from hidingtoface them.He argued that problems in theinstitute were the responsi-bility of Vice-Minister Zhao Zhigang and the former Beijing MunicipalPartyCommittee.Problemsineducationalpractices,hesaid,weretheresponsibility of theMinistry ofHigher Education;his own ministry onlysuppliedfinancingandmaintained thephysicalplant.Intheend,accord-ing to one red guard account,WangZigang cowered infront of the stu-dents, tongue-tied in the face of shouted accusations and slogans,“hisauthority and prestige completely gone."79This direct challenge to top national officials—unprecedented at thetime—spurred a counterattack,and the “anti-interference”campaign un-der way on other campuses was used against the opponents of the workteam,whowere nowaccusedof“rightist”attacks against nationalmin-istries.Concerned about the attack on the ministry,TaoLujia visited thecampus on June 24 to kick off the campaign against opposition at theschool. Wall posters appeared in support of the second work team, andothers attacked the “rightists” who had protested at the ministry. On June26,afterTaoLujiadecreedthattheattackontheministrywascounterrev-olutionary, a broad attack on its participants began. In several mass meet-ings held over the next two weeks, 52 cadres were labeled “rightists,” and799studentsandstudentcadresintheclassesweresubjectedtostrugglesessions and faced similar charges.More than 8oo individuals on a cam-pus of around 5,000 were punished. On July 27, after the order to with-draw work teams, the work team's leader gave a summary report. He did

ChinesePeople'sUniversityTheworkteam at ChinesePeople'sUniversitylaboredunder anunusualrestriction: the school's party secretary, Guo Yingqiu, was in charge ofsupervising work teams for the Municipal Party Committee. The workteam insisted on a thorough purge of the entire power structure, but itfoughttoprevent the accusationsfromfocusing on Guo and SunHuan,his deputy on the party committee.80 The work team did not arrive untilJune 14, after almost two weeks of wall-poster criticism and attacks ontop officials. By this time prominent members of the school power struc-ture,in imitation of Nie Yuanzi and her celebrated comrades at Beidahad already denounced the school's top officials. To assert control andsteerattention awayfromGuo,theworkteamhadtorollbackpoliticalinitiativesthathadalreadybeentakenbyschoolmilitantsoverthepre-ceding two weeks. Not surprisingly, this stimulated resentment, resistance,andopposition.The university's Research Institute was an early source of rebellionagainst Sun Huan and GuoYingqiu.Its first wall poster on June 8 criti-cized the party committee and gained widespread attention. Over thenext week many more wall posters directly attacked Sun, Guo,and othertop school officials, and a militant opposition group formed. In the courseof these events two vice-directors of the institute went over to the rebels intheir campaign to overthrow the party branch secretary, who was tryingto fend off the opposition. On June 14, the day the work team arrived,thetwovice-directorsandsevenotherswereelectedtoaCulturalRevo-lutioncommitteeto take over leadership of the campaignfromthepartybranch. The work team dispatched a group to rectify the institute androllback the earlier rebellion.Itinitiated a criticism campaign against“fakeleftists,”disbanded theinstitute'sCulturalRevolutioncommitteeand trumped up political charges against the two vice-directors who hadsidedwiththerebels.Anumberofstudentsandteachersresistedtheseactions andwere in turn attacked.81To reassert control, the work team concentrated on units that had bredthemostoutspokenandbest-organizedchallengestoGuoandSun.Morethan thirty people who had signed wall posters attacking Guo Yingqiuwere labeled counterrevolutionaries and subjected to struggle sessions. In

TheGenesisofDivision84

itsefforttorootoutGuo'scritics,theworkteamignoredpoliticalcredentials andreportedly attackedrevolutionary cadres andlargenumbersof teachers and students from proletarian households. By mid-July over130 cadres and teachers below the rank of department vice-chairmanwere given political labels and attacked by name for denouncing Secre-tary Guo: 111 of them were party members, 102 were ordinary teachersorcadres,17wereheadsorvice-headsofteachingoffices,and 7weredepartment vice-chairmen. Thirty-five of them were subjected to strugglesessions andhomesearches.82The work team generated widespread opposition as it tried to rollback these independent opposition movements and created large num-bers of victims. At the same time it mobilized large numbers of politicalactivists in its campaign against the rest of the power structure. Manystudent activists were attracted by the work team's policy of permittingaccusations against virtually any cadre in the departments, and they werewilling to abide by the work team's condition that struggle sessions beclearedinadvance.OnJuly29,shortly afterworkteamswerewithdrawn,Guo Yingqiu was dragged back to the campus to answer for his errors.This created an opportunity for the victims of the work team—cadres andstudents alike—to press their cases, and it forced militants who had col-laborated with the work team to defend their decision.83In the previous chapter we saw that work teams did not present clearchoices to political activists between support for and opposition to thestatus quo.In this chapter we have seen the consequences:power struc-tures and the students tied to them were deeply divided.Repeatedlyparty offcials denounced their own superiors or protested the actionsof the work team. Repeatedly, large percentages of the students attackedby theworkteamfor challengingits authoritywerefrom the same groupsthat had the strongest vested interests in the status quo: party members,student cadres, youth league activists, and students from “red" and evenrevolutionarycadrehouseholds.This chapter has also shown why thiswas so.There wererepeated examples of prominent party officials who denounced their superiors in theparty organization at the beginning of June in imitation of Nie Yuanzi atBeida. Nie herself was a party general branch secretary and a member ofthe university's party committee, and her coauthors were all political in-structors and relatively senior party members.Her act encouraged imita-torsfrom similarbackgrounds across the city.Therewererepeated cases

These critics, moreover, quickly developed a following among stu-dents.IftheworkteamshadfollowedtheBeidascenario,theywouldhavepraised the early rebels, given them prominent positions on the workteam, and immediately deposed the party committee. This almost neverhappened. Conservative work teams decided to support the officials whomtheserebelshadalreadydenounced,andthecriticswerethenpunishedinretaliation.Radicalworkteamsrefusedtoacknowledgetherevolution-ary credentials of cadre rebels and forced the early critics to stand asidefor investigation along with the people they had earlier denounced. Incasting doubt on the entire party organization, radical work teams oftenforced student cadres and party members to undergo criticism and exam-ination as tools of a corrupt power structure—even those who had ear-lier rebelled against their superiors. Work teams that pursued a mixedstrategy created opponents inbothways:they targeted the critics of theofficials said to represent the school's“red line”while forcing large num-bers of cadres, party members, and student cadres to stand aside as fol-lowersofa“blackline."No matter what strategy they pursued,work teams created four dis-tinct categories of individuals who were pitted against one another.Thefirst category, relatively large, consisted of all those who sided with theworkteam.Inthecase ofconservativeworkteams,thismeantthattheyacceptedtheclaimthattheschool'spoliticalproblemswerenotsevere.In the case of radical work teams,it meant that they accepted the workteam's charge that their school's political problems werevery severe.Under work teams that pursued a mixed strategy, it meant that they ac-cepted the work team's decision about whom to protect andwhom topurge—if they were lucky enough to escape suspicion themselves. Todemonstrateone'sallegiancetotheworkteamrequiredonetoparticipateactively in the denunciation of the movement's political targets and to takea stand against the work team's opponents, denouncing them in rallies orin wall posters. The work team's most active supporters were elevated topositions of leadership as part of a new power structure. After the workteamleft,members of this groupwereforced to defend their cooperativestance.The second category was much smaller—those punished for opposi-tion to the work team. These people received punishments ranging

from small-group criticism to a harrowing and violent denunciation inamass strugglesession.Atbest,their politicalerror wouldbe notedintheirdossiersandcouldpotentiallyhauntthematsomefuturepoint in their lives. At worst, they would be labeled a “rightist” or even“counterrevolutionary"—a political charge that would ruin their careeropportunities andpotentiallyleadtoincarceration.At the end ofJuly thisgroup was a distinct minority.It was of negligible size in those schoolswhere there was no significant opposition to the work team, but it wasmuch larger in schools where there were major confrontations.These peo-plewere militant activists whofor variousreasons ran afoul of their workteams and ended up unexpectedly as some of the earliest victims of thecampaign. After the withdrawal of the work teams, this group had themost urgent interest in reversing the outcomes of the work-team period.In the third category were party members and student cadres who hadbeen politically activebefore the Cultural Revolution,but who were side-lined by the work team's assault on school power structures. This groupwasrelativelylarge under radical work teams thatrequired all party mem-bers and student cadres to undergo investigation. Those certified as reliableandpermittedtobecomeloyalactivistsunder theworkteam,and thosewho adopted an oppositional stance toward the work team, moved intothe first or second categories. All others, however, remained in a kind ofpolitical limbo—forced tostepdowntemporarilyfrom theirpostspurelybecause of their association with a discredited party leadership, not fullytrusted but at the same time not formally charged with any specific wrong-doing. They were sidelined or, as they put it, “left hanging” (guaqilaile)without clear verdicts. This group was smaller under work teams that pur-suedaconservativeormixedstrategy,althougheveninthesecasesmanystudent cadres and party members were sidelined by the work team's cam-paign. These people were almost invisible under the work teams. They pre-viously had been trusted activists who enjoyed high status and promisingfutures, but now they were in a marginalized and tenuous position, unsureof what the future might bring.The withdrawal of the work teams pro-vided an opportunity to dispel this uncertainty, and members of this groupbecamevocalandactiveinAugust.The fourth category included those who became victims of the purgecampaign for reasons other than opposition to the work team. Primarilycomposed of cadres and teachers, these were people who were denouncedas followers of a “black line” in the party apparatus. The more extensivethe work team's purge, the larger this group. People in this category obvi-

Instead, they were defined by one's immediate experi-ence in the political interactions of June and July and the likely futureconsequences. In other words, students were not divided by prior socialor political status, but by changes in status that resulted from the dra-maticeventsofJune andJuly.Asweshallseeinthenextchapter,themostmilitant rebels in August and September came from the second and thirdcategoriesthose who had experienced sharp status reversals.

TheUniversityRedGuardsFreed from work-team authority, university students organized to con-tinuetheCulturalRevolutionontheirown.Redguardorganizationsproliferated during the first two weeks of August. From the outset theydisagreed fundamentally about the direction the movement should take.and dramatic debates polarized university campuses. By September groupsthat articulated parallel arguments on their respective campuses soughtsupport in cross-campus alliances. These alliances developed relatively coherent political identities and articulated sharply opposed positions aboutthe next stage of the Cultural Revolution.These factional differences, the emotional debates of August, and thesharpening factional struggles of September were not about the status quo.They were not about the features of school power structures or the policiesthey had pursued. These conflicts were about the events of June and Julyand their implications for students who had had different experiences un-der the work teams. They expressed divisions created by work teams whenthey shattered existing power structures and divided their members andfollowers against one another.Two groups instigated the conflict and spearheaded a rebel insurgency.Among the most active and vocal were those who had been punished forchallenging their work team. This group was especially large on campuseswhere major confrontations had occurred.Joining them was a secondgroup: party members, student cadres, and others who had been politicalactivists before the Cultural Revolution but had been sidelined politicallyas work teams assaulted school power structures. Both these groups suf-fered losses of status during June and July and were strongly motivated toreverse these losses and to achieve political vindication.Arrayed against these insurgents were the majority of students who hadcooperated with work teams, led by those appointed to chair CulturalTheUniversityRed Guards

89Revolution preparatory committees.The most committed of them werestudents who had actively supported work teams in their confrontationswithopponents.Thesestudentleaderswerenow on thedefensive:thein-surgents charged that they were implicated in an erroneous political line.Should their opponents succeed in unseating them, the majority would besaddledwithpoliticalerrors.In the campus debates of August and the factional mobilization ofSeptember, these two sides fought for leadership of their schools and theability to define the objectives of the next stage of the Cultural Revolution.They competedfor the allegiance of themajorityof students whohad pas-sivelycompliedwiththeworkteams.Thesestudentsnowfacedachoicebetween two starkly opposed visions of the next stage. Should they setaside the events of June and July, dutifully criticize the errors of the workteams,and then continue theCulturalRevolutionin theirschools asif thework teams had never intervened? Or should they take the fight off thecampuses, locate and detain the work teams’ leaders, bring them back forinterrogation and struggle sessions, and then identify and attack the higherofficials who had supported them?The first position was the one adopted by the“majority”faction,thesecond by theinsurgent“minority.”The position takenby the latter hadmuch more explosive implications for the direction of the Cultural Rev-olution because it led student militants directly up the chain of commandthat had dispatched work teams and into confrontations with nationalleaderswhoheadedthefunctionalministriesinchargeoftheearliercam-paign.For obvious reasons, the “minority”position was viewed as moreradical and subversive of the status quo,a fact eventually recognized bytheCCRGandMao,whohadnotforeseenthisdevelopmentbutwhoquickly exploited it by openly supporting the minority faction in itsstruggleagainsttheirmajorityfactionopponents,whomtheyeventuallydismissedas“conservatives."The radicalism of the minority faction, however, was not a product ofits members’position within university power structures before the Cul-turalRevolution.It was a product of the changes in status that theinencounters with work teams had brought about. They did not have fun-damentally different points of view about the status quo,but they didhavefundamentally different points ofview about the actions of theworkteams.It was this issue and these interests, rooted in the dramatic univer-sityevents ofJune andJuly,that divided studentrebels andset the minor-ityfactiononapoliticalcoursethatradicalizedtheCulturalRevolutionin thefallof1966.

DividedatBirth90

TheOfficialApologyThese divisions crystallized within three weeks. On July 29, 1966, theBeijingMunicipalPartyCommitteesummoned hundreds of activistsfrom schools across the city to attend a mass meeting in the Great Hall ofthe People. Beijing party secretary Li Xuefeng read the order withdraw-ing all work teams, and then the officials responsible for the policy pro-ceededtoexplainthereversalandprovideguidanceonwhatthenextstage would bring.1 Deng Xiaoping, general secretary of the CommunistParty,spokefirst,explainingthatChairmanMaohadorderedthewith-drawal of work teams because “practice has shown that the work-teamformat is unsuited to the requirements of the Cultural Revolution in uni-versities and high schools and must be changed."2 Deng emphasized twopoints.First, the errors committed by the work teams were due to organ-izationalconfusion,haste,andlackofexperience:“Somecomradeshavesaid,old revolutionaries have run into new problems,and indeed this isso.And in sending work teams to every school we were also extremelyhasty because they did not undergo thorough study and discussion.Wecomradesworkingat theParty Center and theMunicipalParty Committeedid not have any experience with this kind of historically unprecedentedmovement.” Although the work teams had not worked out well, Deng ar-gued, not all of them had committed errors, and the errors that had beencommitted were not uniformly severe: “Some work teams were good,some relatively good,but some also committed various errors; some veryserious errors, they suppressed the masses, attacked the revolutionaryleft ... obstructing the development of the Cultural Revolution... Thevast majority of comrades on the work teams were willing to do their jobswell, but the leadership did not give them enough help.Premier Zhou Enlai elaborated these themes, emphasizing that officialshad sent work teams only after activists in the schools had demanded them,having lost confidence in their party committees after the purge of the Bei-jingMunicipalPartyCommittee.3Healsoemphasizedthattheworkteams’ errors were due to haste and insufficient preparation.Even so, someof the work teams had done a good job, and the vast majority of theirmembers had honestly attempted to do the job properly:“Of course,asComrade Xiaoping has just said, some of the work teams were good, butthe majority of the work-team comrades were good... Subjectively theydid not mean to do this, but they worked according to the old methods; aseveryone says,^Old revolutionaries have run into new problems.'"

TheUniversityRed GuardsState Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke last and elaborated on the theme"Old revolutionaries have encountered new problems."4Howto carry out theCultural Revolution?You arenottooclear,donotreallyknow, so you ask us ^How to carry out revolution?' I will answer you honestlyand sincerely:I donotknow either.AndI think that alotof other comradesat the Party Center also do not know.We have to rely on you to carry it out,to learn from the practical revolutionary experience of the teachers, students,andstaffofvariousschoolsincarryingoutrevolution.Liuacknowledgedthatthedesireofsomestudentstocriticizetheworkteamswasunderstandable,andthat this should occur,buthe alsoem-phasizedthattheiractionswereatthebehestofthePartyCenter.Sowhatto do about the work teams?“Now that the work-team format is nolongersuitabletothepresentneedsoftheCulturalRevolution,thePartyCenterhas decided towithdraw them.If you let themleave,then they willleave.Ifyou do not let them leave, and if you still have contrary views, then raisethem; if you have criticisms, then criticize them to the full until you havehadenough."Unknown to the participants, Mao Zedong listened to the proceedingsoffstage, incensed by the way that his colleagues were minimizing the er-rors of the work teams and especially by the slogan“Old revolutionarieshave encountered new problems."5 Just as Liu's speech ended, Mao sud-denly walked through the curtains onto the stage, setting off thunderousapplause and prolonged chanting of “Long live Chairman Mao!” fromtheecstaticstudentactivists.Hewalkedslowlybackandforthacrossthestage, saying nothing and looking impassive.

Kang Shengnonetheless charged that the work team's report on the incident was"counterrevolutionary":We have been through a severe and pointed episode of class struggle. Thisstruggle was with Zhang Chengxian's anti-party, anti-socialist line... Heused his powers of office,used the name of the work team,used the taskgivenhim by the upper levels, to come to Beida to suppress revolution. This right-wing opportunist line represents the road of the capitalist class coming to sup-press the proletariat. At Beida, after “ June 18,” he carried out White Terror.11JiangQing's rhetoric was equally inflammatory:Asfor thosewhoresolutely carried outZhangChengxian andZhangDehua'sunrepentant right-wing opportunist line, they should be resolutely struggledagainst andoverthrown,struggledagainsttilltheystink,criticizedandover-thrown, criticized until they stink.

The official position was that the work teams’ er-rors were inadvertent and due to haste, poor preparation, and the noveltyof the movement. These were well-meaning comrades,“old revolutionar-ieswhoencounterednewproblems,”and they shouldbetreatedwithsym-pathy and respect.

TheAmbiguous"SixteenPoints"In the midst of all this campus activity Mao ordered a plenary session oftheEighthCentralCommittee.AfterseveraldaysofpreliminarymeetingstorelaythecontentsofMao'srecentcriticismsoftheworkteams,CentralCommittee members and forty-seven “responsible persons and revolution-ary teachers and students”(including Nie Yuanzi) convened on August 1for the opening session of the Eleventh Plenum.14 The plenum decisively al-teredthepoliticalsituationinthecapitalandshapedtheenvironmentfonthe student movement thatwas about to explode.First,Mao issued severalletters in which he praised the fighting spirit expressed in the wall postersof the first red guard organizations, and he reprinted and circulated thestudentwallposterstoallinattendance.Mao'ssentimentswererelayedtothe students in private meetings. Second, Mao gave an August 4 speechthat contained serious political charges against the actions of the CentralCommittee on the work-team question, and he made sarcastic and dismis-sivecommentsaboutPartyVice-ChairmanLiuShaoqi.Inthatspeechhepraised Nie Yuanzi's May 25 wall poster, likening its political significanceto“the Paris Commune of the twentieth century.” Third,he had Nie'sBeida wall poster reprinted and circulated to the participants with an ap-pended “wall poster” of his own,“Bombard the Headquarters."15 FinallyLiu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were demoted in the leadership hierarchy,while Marshall Lin Biao and several members of the CCRG—Kang Sheng,Chen Boda, and Tao Zhu—were promoted.The most important document to emerge from the Eleventh Plenumwas the “Decision Concerning the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolu-tion,” or the “Sixteen Points,” released on August 9. It gave the officialverdict on thework teams and laid down guidelinesfor the subsequent stu-dent movement. It reportedly went through more than thirty drafts andended up as a compromise between those who wanted to mobilize a massmovement and those who wanted to limit its disruptive effects.16 The doc-ument'sambiguitiesandcontradictionsenabledstudentswithfundamen-tally different views to claim support for their actions.A clear example of these ambiguities is the way the document mixedconciliatory and incendiary language when describing cadres, and espe-cially the behavior of cadres on work teams. The “vast majority” of cadresin schools,accordingtopoint8,belonged in categories 1and 2—“good”and “relatively good."17 Although most work teams had gone much fur-ther in attacking school power structures, the document was silent on this9%6

DividedatBirthpoint and did not criticize them for excessive zeal. Point 3 contained aneven more mixed message about cadres: although there were indeed goodcadres who had dared to mobilize the masses,welcomed wall posters, andcriticized their own errors, there were also “power holders who had takenthe capitalist road after infiltrating our party” who, when faced with ex-posure,“engaged in further conspiracies,launched hidden attacks,createdrumors, spared no effort to confuse the distinction between revolution andcounterrevolution,and attackedtherevolutionaryfaction."Thedocumentclearlystatedthatstudentswhohadbeenattacked andlabeledbytheworkteams had been wronged.The labels given to them were the primary ex-ample of the “errors in orientation and line” of the work teams. “In themidst of the movement,” point 7 declared, no student should be punishedfor any reason,“unless they committed such counterrevolutionary acts asmurder, arson, poisoning, sabotage, or seizing state secrets."Finally, the document articulated a vision of lively campus debate car-ried out in an atmosphere of mutual respect and democracy. Point 6 ad-monished students to “correctly handle contradictions among the people"by not suppressing the minority that had a divergent viewpoint. “Protectthe minority, because sometimes the minority has truth on their side. Evenif the opinions of the minority are mistaken, permit them to argue, permitthem to hold to their own opinions,” and in carrying out debates,“use rea-son, not force.” The new Cultural Revolution committees that were spring-ing up in the schools, point 9 explained, had “great historical significance."They were by no means temporary expedients but“long-term, permanentnew mass organizations.” They should be elected “according to the princi-ples of the Paris Commune...The nomination lists must be thoroughlydiscussedbythemassesbeforetheelections.”Onceelected,themembersof the committees“canbe criticized at any time,andif they turn out not tobe suitable for the post, after discussion among the masses, new electionscan be held and they can be replaced."Asaguidefor studentradicals,the“SixteenPoints”wasinadequateinseveral respects.First, it did not say anything about what students shouldactuallydowiththeirnewlyestablishedorgansofpower.Itwassilentabout what the new objectives of the movement, if any, should be, or ifthe students should now simply carry on thework team's jobwithout theworkteam.Second,althoughitacknowledgedthatworkteamshadwronglyattackedmanystudents,italsoimpliedthatsomeofthesestu-dents might have committed serious errors and might have been actualrightists.Itwas silentaboutwhatremedies suchstudentshad,andhow

97

TheUniversityRedGuardsthey might go about clearing their names. Third, although it acknowl-edged thatcadresrangedfrom“good"toreactionary,itdidnotprovideany guidelines for drawing distinctions,or who would decide.Studentscoulddrawtwoverydifferentconclusionsfromthisdocument.ThosewhohadcooperatedwiththeworkteamandnowcontrolledschoolCultural Revolution committees could take heart that they were “perma-nent" new organs of power and had the imprimatur of the Central Com-mittee.Becausethesestudentshadcooperatedwiththeworkteam,theywerepleasedtoreadthatnotallofthemhadcommittedseriouserrors.They could also conclude that students who were upset about their treat-ment by the work team should be satisfied with official acknowledgmentthat they had been unjustly attacked and should stop harping on the work-teamissue.Studentswhohadborne thebrunt of the workteam's attacks,how-ever, could draw a very different message from the “Sixteen Points."Their persecution showed that they were indeed “revolutionary,” cer-tainlymoresothanthosewhohadcooperatedwithworkteams.More-over,thework-team cadres whohad attacked themwereevidently“anti-party, anti-socialist elements who infiltrated the party"—exactly the kindof targets that the Cultural Revolution was meant to expose. Therefore,themain task of the Cultural Revolution should nowbe tofocus on theerrorsoftheworkteams andtoexaminethehigher officialswhohadledthem into such serious political errors.The “Sixteen Points”said thatalthough their opinions were in the minority,they should be respected,and the document also said that the truth might be on their side. It alsosaid that nomination lists had to be “thoroughly discussed by the masses"beforehand,andifthosewhowereelectedturnedoutnottobesuitabletheycouldbecriticizedandnewelectionsheld.Therefore,thesestudentsfelt encouraged to challenge the new Cultural Revolution committees andshift the direction of the movement against the work teams and those whohadsentthem.

TheProcessofCampusPolarizationDespite the denunciation of the work teams and assurances that their at-tacks on“revolutionary”students were erroneous,university campuseswere immediately polarized over the work teams’ political legacy. The fun-damental problem was that students whohad cooperated with the workteams were left in charge of schools and had clear majority support.In98

DividedatBirthschools where there had been serious challenges towork-team authority,many of these students participated in the counterattacks against oppo-nents,andalargenumber ofvictimswereonthelosingend.Theyimmediately challenged the new organs of power and put the student militantswhostaffed them onthedefensive.The first documented factional divide was at theBeijing ConstructionInstitute.This institute's work team labeled a number of its opponents“counterrevolutionary” in mid-July. On July 31, after the Municipal PartyCommittee decreed that these opponents were now considered “left-wing,”more than 100 of those who had cooperated marched to the Mu-nicipal Party Committee to protest the decision. In response, some 200students and teachers who supported the decision formed the August 1Combat Team to defend their view. On August 2,a much larger group of1,100 established the Revolution Corps to defend their prior cooperationwith the work team.18 This was the first clear split between a“minority”anda“majority”faction.OnAugust 2 and3LiuShaoqivisited thecam-pustotrytomediate,advisingthetwosidestobetolerantofeachotherand trying to lessen animus against the work team.19Similar splits occurred at universities throughout Beijing, most notablyat three that later generated strong rebel movements and famous redguard leaders—Qinghua University, the Geology Institute, and the Aero-nauticsInstitute.

QinghuaUniversityWhen the Qinghua work team withdrew, it left behind a network of de-partmental Cultural Revolution committees composed of student activistswho cooperated actively in the work team's campaigns against both theold party apparatus and opponents of the work team like Kuai Dafu. Theschool's first red guard organization was established on August 5 by LiuTao,oneofLiuShaoqi'sdaughtersandcoauthorofanearlywallposterattacking Party Secretary Jiang Nanxiang.20 The Qinghua Red Guardswere established on August 19. It emphasized family revolutionary her-itage as a criterionfor membership—initially, only children of revolution-ary cadres and soldiers were admitted. This alienated student cadres andparty members who were from other kinds of “red” households (peasantsand workers), and it also alienated students from revolutionary householdswho opposed this“closed-door"”strategy.21As the work team was preparing to leave, a campus debate broke out.One group of students denounced the work team for“serious errors ofTheUniversityRedGuards

99orientation and line,” while another argued that despite its errors, theworkteam'sradicalorientationwasbasicallycorrect.Duringhiscampusvisit on August 4,Zhou Enlai had tried to smooth over the disagree-ments.Heacknowledgedtheworkteam'serrorsandannouncedtherehabilitation of KuaiDafu and others,but he told the students toforgetabout the work teams, unite under the preparatory committee, and con-tinue the struggle against the school's “black gang."22 On August 7 thepreparatory committee issued a call for all students to unite under its lead-ership and continue the struggle within the school.It was immediatelychallenged by students who organized the August 8Alliance in favor of in-tensified criticism of the work team.In response, the preparatory commit-tee established the August 9 Alliance, which argued that students shouldnot get entangled in the work-team question but should instead push theoffensive against the school's revisionists.As its first step in this pro-gram, it held a mass struggle session against one of the school's party vice-secretaries.23Theleadersof the“minority”August8Alliancewerestudentactivistswith “red" family heritage and strong party ties who had been marginal-izedundertheworkteam,alongwithsomeofthestudentswhohadbeenattacked with Kuai Dafu for challenging the work team. They includedTang Wei,who was the son of a revolutionary martyr, and ChenYuting.whose father was a party cadre. Liu Quan, like Kuai Dafu, was one of theboldestcriticsoftheworkteam and one ofthebest-knownvictims ofitscampaign against opponents and had been publicly exonerated by ZhouEnlai in his August 4 speech.Liu was a student cadre—the youthleaguebranchsecretaryofhisclassroom—andhisfatherwasaprovincialvice-governor. In June he had called for the replacement of the work team'sleader in a wall poster.The work team had attacked him as a counterrev-olutionary in retaliation.24Shen Ruhuai, from a poor peasant household, was a youth leaguebranch secretary, but he was also a party member and head of his partycell.25 Even before the arrival of the work team, Shen put up a wallposter attacking Party Secretary Jiang Nanxiang, but he also argued thatthe party organization was still basically Marxist.After the work teamarrived, it denounced the entire organization as rotten. His classroom'syouth league and party organizations ceased to function,and he wasforced to stand down from his post and undergo examination along withthe rest of the party apparatus. New leaders appointed by the work teamran the classroom, and Shen watched passively as students freely targetedcadres.26100

DividedatBirthShenwas eventuallycleared ofpolitical charges andwas invitedby thework team to help it run the campaign in his department, but he harboredstrong doubts about the work team's behavior.Shenfelt that the workteam's attack on loyal and well-meaning party members, some of whomwerehisfriendsandcomrades,wasfartooharsh.Whenstudentsencour-aged by the work team's radical stance went too far in their rebellion andeventually chafed at its authority, the work team cracked down on them.Although we all expressed our support for the work team, we were reallybotheredbytheirbehavior.First,they camein anddraggedout allmannerof black gang elements among the leaders, but now, all of a sudden, why aretheygrabbing all kinds of counterrevolutionaries among the students?Howcantherebesomanyclassenemies atQinghua?I couldnotfigurethis out andfelt that the work team’s methods were problematic.First, the work teamkicked all 5o0 cadres out of power and called them a black gang,incitingthe students to put them through struggle sessions and parade them around.Then, when as a result of this policy the students went too far, they tried torein them in, causing students to resist. Then they turned around and at-tacked allthesestudents ascounterrevolutionaries.Theworkteamshouldhaveobjectivelyassessedthereasonsfor thestudents’behavior andcor-rected it, but instead they considered them rightist students who were plot-tingtoseizepower.27TheseAugust8activists established their ownpoliticalorganization,the Maoism Red Guards, on August 22.A few days earlier, two of theorganizers, Tang Wei and Chen Yuting,put up a wall poster calling LiuShaoqi's wife, Wang Guangmei, a “political crook” for her actions whileadvising the Qinghuaworkteam.Theywere surprisedwhenin responseleading supporters of August 9 put up their own wall posters critical ofWang Guangmei.Of particular note were a wall poster byHePengfeithesonofMarshallHeLong,andsixotherhighofficials'children,andaseparate wall poster by Liu Shaoqi's daughter (Wang Guangmei's step-daughter), Liu Tao. The attacks on the state chairman's wife by thesehighofficials’childrensignaledtotheothersthatLiuShaoqimustbeinserious political trouble.In response, the August 8 group went furtherandputupawallposterthatdescribedLiuShaoqi'sspeechattheJuly29massmeetingofstudentactivistsattheGreatHallofthePeopleasaviolationofMaoZedongthought.28Zhou Enlai once again tried to calm the controversy in a trip toQinghuaonAugust22,bringingtheformerwork-teamheadYeLin

TheUniversityRedGuardsalong with him. Ye Lin read out an extended self-criticism, and ZhouEnlaidenouncedtheworkteam'serrors andthe“whiteterror”ithadim-posed on revolutionary students. However, he instructed students to uniteand strengthen Qinghua's new organs of political power. Students associ-ated with August 8 nonetheless continued to put up wall posters criticalof Liu Shaoqi, and some of them criticized Zhou Enlai's weak politicalstand, demanding instead that recordings of more militant speeches byJiangQing andKangShengbebroadcastover theschool'sloudspeakersystem.29On August 24 the Qinghua Red Guards met on campus with repre-sentatives ofmajorityfactionsfrom twelve other universities and agreedon a coordinated response. He Pengfei,who chaired the meeting, ac-cused the Maoism Red Guards of attacking the party center and Chair-man Mao. That evening some 2,0oo red guards from twelve schools en-tered the Qinghua campus, took over the auditorium, and disrupted ameeting of the Maoism Red Guards. They closed off the wall-posterarea, took over the school's broadcasting system, and issued an ultima-tum charging that the Maoism Red Guards were composed of rightistswho were trying to overthrow the Communist Party. They took photosof offending wall posters and recorded the authors’names. They chasedaway readers, searched their book bags, and tore down offending wallposters.Afterward they tore down the historic university gate.

BeijingGeologyInstituteAt the GeologyInstitute a well-organized opposition movement hadmountedamajorchallengetotheworkteam.Theminorityfactionwasorganized and led by veterans of that struggle, almost all of whom wereCommunistYouthLeague cadres, and one of whom was a party member.One of the organizers of the opposition was Mei Jianming,who wasfrom a revolutionary cadre household: his father was Mei Gongbin, whojoined theparty in the1930s and was the secretary general of both theCentralCommittee'sUnited FrontWork Department and the Chinese102

Beforethearrivaloftheworkteam,henonethelessjoinedinthecriticismofde-partmental cadres and was immediately at odds with his party superiors.After the work team arrived, he felt vindicated and became a leadingCultural Revolution activist, but he opposed the work team's harshattacks against student critics:“Before the work team came, we were anoppressed minority,but now we were supported,we were movement ac-tivists.Buttheworkteamstartedtocriticizethemassesandcollectmaterials onthem,and thisbothered me more and more,soIeventuallyraised criticisms of the work team. In an instant I became an opponent ofthe work team. I became an object of criticism and struggle overnight.from an activist to a reactionary student."32 Emboldened by his father'sprestige,Mei Jianming wrote a wall poster attacking the work team.Despite the work team's efforts to isolate Mei, he still had many sympa-thizers on campus and refused to be intimidated. He suddenly realizedthe seriousness of the situation when the work team persisted and labeledhim a counterrevolutionary: "This woke me up—the label was real."33After thework team's departure the students whohad cooperated withthe work team controlled the preparatory committee. Veterans of theanti-work-teammovementimmediatelychallenged them andestablishedthe Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards, which merged with other anti-work-team groups to form the East Is Red Commune on August 17.34Theleaders ofEastIsRedwereyouthleague activists,andmanyof themwereyouthleaguecadres.AmongthemwereZhuChengzhao,a25-year-old“cadre transfer student”and son of a bureau-level official who was afourth-year student in the Hydrology Department, and Jiang Lianpu, afifth-year student in Mei Jianming's own Survey Department. Also promi-nent was Wang Dabin, a party member who later assumed leadership ofthe group in early 1967.35 East Is Red called for criticism of the workteam's actions and for its leader to return to campus for interrogation andpublic apologies. It also refused to continue the work team's campaignagainst top school officials because the work team had targeted its promi-nentalliesintheschoolleadership—especiallypartystandingcommitteememberLiGui-andhadattackedPartySecretaryGaoYuanguiasascapegoatforerrorscommittedbyotherschoolofficials.The preparatory committee responded by pulling together the studentgroups whosupported it into theGeologyInstituteRed Guards onAu-gust 22.36 It had the backing of offcials in the Ministry of Geology, whoTheUniversityRedGuards

103had already clashed with opponents of the work team duringJune andJuly.37 The debate about the work team therefore had a special intensity.East Is Red's attack on the work team and its accusations against ministryofficials directly undermined the majority faction's position and implicatedits members in alleged political errors.

BeijingAeronauticsInstituteStudent opposition at the Aeronautics Institute had forced a major con-frontationwith the workteam similar inscope to the one at theGeologyInstitute.News of the denunciation ofBeida's work team led immediatelyto calls to reverse the verdicts against the student opponents branded “re-actionary”andtoreplacedepartmentalCulturalRevolutioncommitteesstaffedbywork-teamloyalists.OnJuly29work-teamheadZhaoRuzhang held a mass meeting to announce the work team's withdrawaland the appointment of twelve students to a preparatory committee thatwould organize elections for a Cultural Revolution committee.38This announcement touched off a debate over the preparatory commit-teeand the status of studentsbranded“reactionary”bytheworkteam.Opponents renewed their accusations against the work team, arguing thatthe preparatory committee was illegal, and that the political charges againstthem should be overturned. Supporters argued that despite the work team'serrors, its radical stance was basically correct, and that some of the wallposters did express reactionary views. In response to charges that it was il-legal, the preparatory committee called for early elections.During this period the preparatory committee began setting up red guardorganizations, and these plans became controversial. On August 1 it an-nounced that the criterion for membership was the acceptance of the workteamasrevolutionary.Thepreparatory committeegavetheworkteam awarm send-off when it departed on August 2.In protest,forty anti-work-teamstudentsmarcheddowntowntotheCentralCommittee offices anddemandedanaudiencewiththeCCRG.Thenextday theymetwithZhouRongxin, secretary-general of the State Council, who agreed with themthattheworkteamshouldreturntotheschoolforcriticism.In the meantime, the preparatory committee went ahead with its plans.OnAugust3itannouncedtheformationoftheAeronauticsInstituteRed Guards. Although its founding proclamation immediately touchedoff a campus debate, the preparatory committee continued plans for104

The opposition argued that the elections must be postponeduntilafterthedebateabouttheworkteam.Ignoringthesearguments,thepreparatory committee held elections, and the victorious incumbents ar-gued that their position was now ratified by the masses and no longerrested solely on the departing work team's final act.In protest,on August 10the opposition mobilized over 400 studentstomarchtotheCentralCommittee'sofficestodemandthatwork-teamhead Zhao Ruzhang return to the campus for criticism.Their demandswere immediately granted.In an effort to placate the opposition,thepreparatory committee announced that Zhao would return to the cam-pus the next day for a mass meeting, after which he would leave immedi-ately.Instead of helping reconcile the two factions,the August 11 massmeeting led to a confrontation that further widened the growing divide.Members of the work team entered the campus, escorted by members ofthe Aeronautics Institute Red Guards, who gave them a warm welcome.Alongtheway,someoftheredguardstoredownwallpostersthatde-nounced the work team, and others yelled “Long live the work team."Members of the work team gave brief self-criticisms and then immedi-ately left the campus, escorted by the Red Guards. The opposition calledthe slogans in support of Zhao Ruzhang “reactionary”and intensified itsaccusations againsthis“crimes”initswallposters.The confrontations climaxed at a mass meeting on August 14 that wasattended byseveral officialsfrom theNational DefenseScience andTech-nology Commission.The event started with forty minutes of sloganchanting during which each side tried to shout down the other.After theuproar subsided, Zhao Ruzhang gave a more extended self-criticism, andrepresentatives from both sides gave speeches. During the meeting a scuf-fle broke out in front of the stage, and several staff workers who sup-ported the work team were injured.The work team's supporters labeledthisa“counterrevolutionaryincident,”and thenextday theRed Guardssent nine truckloads of delegates to the State Council offices to lodge anaccusation.Family members of staff workers marched across campus toprotest the “beating of workers,”as did majority-faction red guardsfrom the nearby Geology Institute,Forestry Institute,and Mining Insti-tute.

In response, the preparatory committeeorganized a series of sessions at which campus workers testified abouttheir oppression in the old societymeetings called to foster “proletar-ian class feelings.” The preparatory committee also organized an officialinvestigation that was boycotted by the opposition. Arrangements to holda campuswide joint debate about the alleged incident broke down.On August 19 the opposition set up its own red guard organizations,which soon merged into a campuswide minority faction, Aeronautics Insti-tute Red Flag.

RedFlag was convinced that the majority faction had prematurely closed offdebate about the work team, and it still disputed the outcome of the“premature”elections of early August. Its grievances intensified on Au-gust 23when it was revealed that ZhaoRuzhang had ordered the workteamto draw up ablacklist containing thenames of allthosewhohadauthoredwallposterscriticaloftheworkteam.Theambiguousoutcomeof the campus debate about ZhaoRuzhang, coupled with renewed fearsabout the documentation of the earlier political charges against the workteam's opponents, spurred Red Flag to more daring attacks that shortlypropelled it into thevanguard of thecity'srebel movement.106

TheBeidaExceptionAs campuses across Beijing split over the work-team question,Beida wasa glaring exception. There was no majority-minority split over the legacyof the work team. Opposing factions appeared much later, in October,overdifferentissues.Theabsenceofatypicalmajority-minoritydivisionwas due partly to the fact thatBeida's work team faced no serious oppo-sition andleft almostno studentvictims,but themostimportantreasonwastheuniqueroleofNieYuanzi.Celebratedinthemassmediaforherfamous wall poster, praised effusively by Mao at the Eleventh Plenum,andworking hand in handwithBeida's radical work team alongwithcoauthors and supporters who staffed the work team's offices, Nie hadnonethelessdenouncedtheworkteam'sleadersinlateJulyandhadbeenplaced at the head of the school's preparatory committee by the CCRG.Nie therefore occupied a unique position. She was a senior official in theparty apparatus and had strong elite ties, but she was also the university'smost celebrated rebel. Despite her cooperation with the discredited workteam,her prior ties with Maoist officials earned her their support andpraise.During the next six weeks Nie moved to consolidate her power at Beida.As Nie prepared for the elections, she established a regular working rela-tionship with her elite sponsors. On August 10 she visited CaoYi'ou at herhome to plan struggle sessions. On August 14 Kang Sheng sent instruc-tions about forthcoming struggle sessions, which she held at the Beidasportsfield on August 15 against formerPartySecretaryLu Ping and othermembers of the party standing committee.39 On August 18 she was invitedonto the rostrum at a massive Tiananmen rally for the red guards, duringwhichshehadapersonalaudiencewithMaoinoneofthereceptionrooms.Beida's work team had done the bidding of Nie's dissidents all along,vindicating their actions intheSocialistEducationMovement andperse-cuting those who had opposed her. The only difference now was that Nieand her Beida colleagues were in charge. Wall-poster collections formerlyedited and published by the work team were issued in virtually identicalformat in the name of the preparatory committee and contained identicalmaterial.40 In fact, the preparatory committee continued to issue wall-poster collections based on material collected under the workteam,back-dating several of its publications to mid-July.41 This did not stop it fromsimultaneouslypublishingdenunciations of theworkteam.42Beida cadres

The work team's operations simply continuedundernewmanagement.As confrontations between opposed factions grew on other campuses,Beidainsteadbecame amodelunit,arevolutionary touristsite.Duringthefirst two weeks of August, 718,000 registered visitors flocked to the cam-pus to view wall posters and exhibitions. Political suspects in the schoolwere formed into “labor reform brigades.” The preparatory committe is-sued an instruction manual, “How to Conduct People's War"—a guide tointerrogationsandextracting confessionsfromsuspects—which wascopied and reprinted throughout the country.43 The number of strugglesessions increased,house searches intensified, and suicides were more fre-quent.44 An official red guard organization was established at a mass rallyon August 19 at which Nie Yuanzi presided. Red guards were to be orga-nized at the department level and attached to the emerging new schoolpower structure under Nie's direction.As was common with red guard or-ganizations sponsored by preparatory committees, the organization was tobe formed from descendants of the first generation of revolutionaries.45OnSeptember 9elections wereheld for theBeida Cultural RevolutionCommittee. Nie and her Philosophy Department comrades were electedtosixoftheforty-fourseats;Niebecamechairman andherlongtime allyKong Fan the first-ranking of four vice-chairmen.46 Administrative postswere dominated by Nie's Philosophy Department allies: Yang Keming, acoauthor of the May 25 wall poster, was still head of propaganda andwas the editor of the school's newspaper, Xin Beida,which put out itsfirst issue on August 22, with masthead calligraphy supplied by Mao.47With no real opposition to the Beida work team, there was no politicalbasis for a minority faction. As the citywide struggle by “minority” fac-tions challenged preparatory committees at other schools, Nie and her com-rades stood to one side, quietly consolidating a new school power structurewith backing from the highest levels of Maoist officialdom.

TheAugustDebatesBy the third week of August clearly opposed majority and minority or-ganizations had formed in the vast majority of the schools (see Table 4.1).The process accelerated after the first mass rallyfor red guards atTiananmen Square on August 18.Majority factions frequently adopteda simple name, Red Guards, which signaled that they were the official

DividedatBirthorganization of their school's preparatory committee. Minority factionsmore commonly added a prefix to their title:“Maoism”or“Mao ZedongThought."”“Red Flag,”and “East Is Red”were some of the more popularalternative names. The factional divisions were expressed in public de-bates, wall posters, and editorials published in newly established studentnewspapers. On virtually all campuses the “majority” was in the initiallydominant position—people who had actively supported their work teamand who ended up controlling the preparatory committees. Contestingtheir authority was a campus “minority” led by people who had clashedwiththeworkteamorwhohadbeenmarginalizedbyitscampaign.The divergent points of view were already evident in early August, andpositionshardenedintheensuingweeks.Asanimositiesmounted,thedebates took on an increasingly accusatory and threatening tone.48 Theissuethatimmediately drove awedgebetween the two sideswas therolethat the work team had played in their school. The “Sixteen Points"statedthattheworkteamshadcommittedseriouserrorsoforientationand line because they had suppressed the student movement, thereby ob-structing the Cultural Revolution. These pronouncements, however,failed to address key questions about university-level politics, because thestudentsleft in charge of the schools were activists whohad cooperatedwiththeworkteams.Students therefore disagreed about the severity of the work teams’er-rors.Majority factions drew on the speeches by Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiao-ping, and Zhou Enlai: the work teams had committed errors because theyhad“misunderstood"Mao'sintentions.Theleaders of the work teamswere“veteranrevolutionaries”whomadegreatcontributionsinthepast.The majority factions urged students to “criticize the work team but sup-port the work team." The minority position was starkly different: theworkteamshadcommittedseriouserrorsoforientationandline.Theirer-rors were not inadvertent—they were trying to suppress student radicalsandbluntMao'sCulturalRevolution.The two sides also disagreed fundamentally about the next stage of theCultural Revolution. The majority argued that it should continue theCultural Revolution under student leadership and immediately hold elec-tions topermanentorgans ofpower,as the“SixteenPoints”stipulated.Tothis end,preparatory committees organized struggle sessions againstmajor political targets and put large numbers of cadres and faculty undendetention on campus in “labor reform brigades.” The minority did notobject to the further persecution of school officials, but it did object to

111

TheUniversityRed Guardsholding elections so soon. Elections should be postponed, it argued, be-cause the work teams had biased the outcomes by putting their support-ersincharge.Before any trulymeaningfulelections couldbeheld,theleaders of the work team must be brought back to the campus and madeto confess their crimes. In short, the movement should focus on the crimesof the work team. Minority factions fought to postpone campus elections,and after failing to do so, they objected that the results were unfair andshouldbe overturned.Those in the majority faction understood that the attacks on the workteamwereinfact aimed at them.Their claimtoleadership,after all,wasbased on their prior cooperation with the work team. After the elections,however, they had a new claim to power—they were elected according toofficialpolicy.Theyclaimedthattheminoritywasinterestedonlyinnarrow personal interests—its members sought personal“rehabilitation”aftertheirearlierclasheswiththeworkteam.Thiswaswhytheyper-versely insisted on “turning veteran revolutionaries into counterrevolu-tionaries."Theminority countered that the electionswereillegitimatebecause theoutcome reflected the influence of the work team.Most students still wereinsufficientlyconscious ofthe workteam'scrimes,andaslongasthesecrimes were covered up,the situation would not change.Second,the reha-bilitation issue was not a narrow one but had broad political importancebecause the suppression of the school's true revolutionary students was theprimary error of the work teams. Third, in response to the charge of “di-verting the spearhead of the movement,”they agreed that this was pre-cisely what they were trying to do: the work teams had turned the spear-head of the movement against the revolutionary masses,but now theywere trying to turn the movement back onto the right track. Finally, con-cerningtheideathattheminoritywas attacking“veteranrevolutionaries,all who opposed Chairman Mao must be struggled against and could losetheir posts, no matter how high their position or how glorious their pastcontributions.

TanLifu:MajorityAdvocateDuring these August debates the leader of the Beijing Industrial Univer-sity Red Guards gave a powerful and passionate speech on his campus insupport of his majority faction's position. This speech was transcribedandwidelycirculatedandbecamehighlyinfluential.Itstronglydefended112

DividedatBirththeactions of his school'swork team andpraised the revolutionarycredentials of its leader. Because the speaker, Tan Lifu, was the son of aveteranrevolutionarywhoheldahighpostafter1949,andbecausehestrongly defended the proposition that the children of revolutionarieshad especially strong political loyalties, his speech was once consideredkey evidence for the idea that“conservative”red guards from elite back-grounds supported school power structures and the work teams that haddefended them, and that red guard factions expressed the different inter-ests of students from different family origins.49After the full text of thespeech became available and details of the school's political history becameknown,itbecameclearthatTan'scaseinsteadillustratedhowtheworkteams divided school power structures and split students from identicalbackgrounds over issues that had little to do with the status quo ante.50Tan Lifu was a twenty-four-year-old student and already a member ofthe CommunistParty.Hehad the mostimpeccable of family revolution-ary credentials and had actually been born in the fabled revolutionarybase area in Yan'an. His father, Tan Zhengwen, was an official in theYan'an security apparatus and a close protegé of Kang Sheng. He was thefirst directorof theBeijingBureau ofPublicSecurity after the communistvictory in 1949,and during the 1950s he served on the Beijing Munici-palPartyCommitteeandasdeputydirectorofChina'sequivalentoftheState Prosecutor's Office before his death in 1961 at the age of 51.51 TanLifu's mother, Jiang Tao, was a section chief in the Beijing Bureau ofPublicSecurity.52Despitetheseeliteties,TanLifu'spoliticalactivismwasmotivatedbyreal grievances against his school's party organization. Tan was far froma model student or party member, and his party superiors were so exas-perated with him that, according to Tan, they “let everybody seize on myshortcomings” and “made me into an example of the way that high cadrekids were changing."53 Although Tan knew that his party superiorsthoughtlittleofhim,helearnedearlyintheCulturalRevolution thattheparty committee considered him to have a “revisionist viewpoint.”Itwas then that Tan realized the full measure of his antagonism toward the"black gang” on the university party committee. This spurred him to getinvolved in Cultural Revolution politics in a big way.54The first work team permitted the party committee to run its own cam-paign.However, the second one was completely different.Led by DuWan-rong, an official from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General StaffHeadquarters and a former political commissar with the Eighth RouteArmy, it proceeded with a radical purge. Because this radical work team,

113

TheUniversityRedGuardsheaded by a military cadre with genuine revolutionary credentials,wastormenting a party apparatus against which Tan harbored serious griev.ances, Tan became a leading activist and strong supporter. When thework team withdrew from the school on July 29, it appointed one of TanLifu's classmates, Liu Jing, to head the preparatory committee. Tan wasput in charge of the red guards.5sThe budding “minority” faction was led by students who had clashedwiththefirstworkteambutwhohadbeensubsequentlymarginalizedbythesecond,whichrefusedtoaddressthefirstworkteam'serrors.Themost outspoken opponents were also the children of revolutionaries, andall of them had been political activists before the Cultural Revolution.56These students now argued that the elections should be postponed. Theyimmediately confronted Liu Jing and Tan Lifu, charging that the secondwork team had suppressed them as well,and that it was therefore nomore revolutionary than the first one.In the face of mounting criticism,Tan's group proposed to move forward with elections, but the oppositionobjected.Itsmembers argued that the situation at theuniversity wouldnot afford them a fair chance.The“lingering poison”of the work teamsstill tainted the university's political atmosphere, and the red guards andpreparatorycommitteehadunjustlybenefitedfromtheirgoodrelation-ship with the work team, which had earned them the support of a largestudentmajority.The opposition wanted to delay elections and hold a debate about thework teams’ conduct, which it felt was necessary to strengthen its sup-port. Tan and Liu Jing argued that this would only delay the movement bydragging in irrelevant side issues, but they agreed to one week of debates.The opposition, in turn, complained about the conduct of the debates, es-pecially Tan's intimidating tone. After the debates were over, it objectedto plans for elections because the debate had been unfair.Tan's speech hammered at several key points. The first was that the priorschoolleadershiphadbeendominatedbymembersofthePengZhen"black gang”on the Beijing Party Committee that had been purged at theoutset of the Cultural Revolution—specifically the school's party secretary,Song Shuo. Tan referred several times to “this rotten old nest of a univer-sity." The earlier leaders had promoted revisionism,using a “red mill-stone” to “force down the heads of the many students from worker, peas-ant, and cadre families."57 Tan showed no trace of sympathy for theformerleadershipoftheschool.Revisionismhadsodominated theschoolin recent years that there was a lot of cleaning up to do. “There are manyenemies,andwhenwefinishstrikingdown onethereis anothertostrike,114

DividedatBirthand even though we are exhausted from sweeping them away,we still havenot swept things clean."58 Tan's starting point was the same position takenbyNieYuanziinher attacksagainstBeida'sleadersinlateMayandearlyJune:theschool'sleadershipwasrottentothecoreandneededtobethor-oughly cleansed.59Tan's second point contained a barely concealed political threat againsthis opponents: they sounded like rightists who opposed the Cultural Rev-olution, they borrowed long-discredited arguments from the purged Bei-jingPartySecretaryPengZhen,andinfacttheyweremotivatedbynar-rowly private interests. “Some say, “The lingering poison of the workteamhasnotbeeneliminated’Theworkteam'shiddenremnantshavenot been scattered'; in my view it is the lingering poison of revisionismthat has not been eliminated, the hidden remnants of Peng Zhen thathave not been scattered!"60 Tan argued that members of the oppositionquestioned the militant assertion of the party's class line because theywere the same kind of revisionists as the previous school leaders, underwhom theyhad flourished:Some people do not hate the black gang; Peng Zhen’s “emphasize performance”hasleft such a sweet taste in their mouths,how can they hate him?However, regarding the work teams, regarding these old revolutionary com-rades, they hate them down to their very bones.They are still interested inthe work team and struggling against the black gang. When they find outsome cadre has made a mistake,they arehappy as can be,they jumpforjoyWhat are you happy about when a communist party cadre makes a mistake?Damn it! (someone yells, damn right! warm applause)61Tan's third point was that the second work team had gotten it rightWhatever the errors of thefirst one or of work teams at other universi-ties,the school's second onehad pursued a consistently radical courseand had been led by a genuine revolutionary cadre from the People's Lib-eration Army. Its members were not tools of any black gang; they wereold revolutionary comrades who had done their jobs properly and whodeservedrespectandadmiration:When they saw that the work team headed by Du Wanrong supported us, andwe “country bumpkins” had power in our hands, some people cursed usbehind ourbacks.Weknew this.Weheard the sound of their teethgrindingbehind our backs (laughter, applause). We know Du Wanrong ... On the

That dayfor thefirst time weheardatIndustrialUniversity thekind of talk thatwe can onlyhear at home,for the first time we felt likeIndustrial University was likehome.62Having defended the radical line taken by the second work team, Tanemphasized a fourth point, the one for which his speech later became sofamous. He went on to defend the class line pushed at the outset of theCultural Revolution: “As soon as you bring up the class line, we are peo-ple with ‘vested interests.’ Comrades, I will give you an example, a verysimple one. How can the son of a poor peasant who has stood up, and theson of a landlord who has been the object of struggle, possibly have thesame feelings about land reform? (warm applause). Comrades, this is whatis called being branded by your class.'"The real reasons for his opponents’ criticisms, Tan argued, was thatthey were the oneswith vested interests to defend:Those people who have been overthrown, those who felt that from this pointon they faced an uncertain future, those people who felt that from this pointon their own younger brothers and sisters, their own families had no politicalfuture,how can theyhave the same feelings,how can they speak the samelanguage as us? Some people make big speeches about “equality” and “frater-nity." In a class society, where is there any “equality” or “fraternity"? Wehave alot ofbrothers andsisters who are cruelly murderedby theenemies assoon as they are born; it is called cutting up the weeds and digging up theroots! (Silent hall: someone yells a slogan, “Always remember class bitterness!Donotforget thebloodhatred!")Now,we exercise dictatorship overyourparents,andexercisethepolicy of doingeverythingpossibletoremold them,giving them repeated opportunities to become an upright person. Their chil-dren can attend school, and if they perform well can enter the youth league,and the party. What else do they want? All this garbage about “equality” and"fraternity” that you are all parroting these days should all be sent straight tothe toilet!... Here only 20 percent of us are children of workers, peasants,and revolutionary cadres; we get going for only a few days, and some peopleare already yelling we are too“left."63Tan argued that those who opposed the party's class line had ulteriormotives. They were trying to reverse the verdicts on their families, trying116

DividedatBirthtorestore the situationundertherevisionists wherethemilitant“left"class line was not being followed, trying to escape from the consequencesof their opposition to the Left earlier in the Cultural Revolution, andtrying to twist Mao Zedong thought to suit their own purposes. The realproblem,Tanargued,wasthatthesepeopledidnotreallywantrevo-lution:As for reforming the system of university examinations, some people hideundertheir covers andcry,theirbeautifuldreamsabout jobassignmentssmashed, and say,“If you carry out the class line, my future is finished, myfamily's future is finished!"After seventeen years of excessive lenience, yourfamily is still not finished? You damn well should have been finished off longago!64Instead, these students who now opposed the school's Cultural Revolu-tion vacillated and whined and refused to get up on the stage to speak:If we have a debate, you do not want to debate. If we do not have a debate,you want to debate. To just send a few lackeys up here to tremble weakly ..:Some people do not speak, they say their materials are not fully prepared . .There are people who are always looking through books searching for regula-tions, they all wait for instructions from the center; how are you going to bethe “vanguard” of anything? I think it is only the children of workers, peas-ants,and revolutionary cadres whohave thatkind of guts,thatkind of abil-ity; who among all you others dare to? (warm applause) It seems that “"theson of a hero is a real man” [laozi yingxionger haohan] (Masses: “The son ofa reactionary is abastard—it is basicallylike this!"[Laozi fandong er hun-dan, jiben ruci!] warm applause).65Finally, Tan argued that his opponents were narrow-minded sectarianswho were scouring official documents and Mao's works for quotations todemonstratethatthemajorityfactionhad committeddoctrinalerrors.Tanheaped scorn on the practice of wrenching quotes from Mao's works outof context to justify political positions. “Others say, we are all intellectu-als, we are all petty bourgeois, and moreover quote from the classics andsay that this is Chairman Mao's ‘class analysis.’Take something that theChairman said in the 1920s and apply it to the 1960s! How can this work?Theliving application of MaoZedong Thought is in concrete matters,concrete analysis." Besides, Tan argued, Mao Zedong thought itself wasnotsomedeadclassicbut aguide topracticalaction:“Nowherein the

117

TheUniversityRed Guardsworldisthereanythingthatis1o0percentcorrect.MaoZedongThoughiitself is still developing continuously, and necessarily must still make newdiscoveries, inventions, creations, and advances!...These people takingMao's book and simplifying it down into horseshit just does not makesense."66Tan's speech carried the day and was reprinted and circulated through-out the city, winning strong approval from other majority factions andearning him the enduring enmity of the city's minority factions. Tan andLiu Jing won election to the school's Cultural Revolution committeeand proceeded with a purge of the school's “black gang” that was, accord-ing to Tan's opponents, even more militant than the policies of the secondwork team.67 Like majority factions at other schools,Tan's group was notabout toleave itself open to charges that it was soft on the officials whohad previously run the school.Read out of context,Tan Lifu's speech is highly misleading.Becausehe coupled the defense of the party's standard class line with a defense ofhis school's second work team, one might be left with the impressionthatTanwasdefendingthevestedinterestsofthosetiedtotheregimebyeither party membership or birth against people from other backgrounds.Tan's leading opponents, in fact, were from a similar background. Tan'sprimary opponent at the time of the debate, Bai Zhiqi, was a full partymember and the son of a revolutionary martyr. A young teacher in Tan'sown department,he signed the first wall poster to attack the school'sparty committee,which went up on May 29,several days before thearrival of the first work team. When the first work team appeared bent onprotecting the local power holders,he led the opposition.When the secondwork team chose to rely on other activists,he opposed them as well. A sec-ond prominent opponent, Zhang Jinmin, was a student from a revolution-ary cadre background. He had also opposed the first work team and waseventually labeled “anti-party” by it—a verdict the second work team re-fused to reconsider.68Tan'sdefenseof theparty'sclasslineinsinuated thathisopponentswerefrom less reliable political backgrounds, but this was a willful distortion,and Tan's opponents later fired back. Outraged that students from badclass backgrounds were being accepted as revolutionary activists whileTan supported his position by reference to the party's class line, his opponents replied:“We are from worker,peasant, and revolutionary cadre fam-ilies; we have incomparably deep feelings of affection for the party andChairman Mao."69118

DividedatBirthOnAugust 29,shortly after the minority faction established its rivalEast IsRed organization,TanLifu expressed exasperation about the roleof his “red" classmates in the opposition.“It is being said that some ofthe people in East Is Red are saying to people of bad class background,You do not dare to speak, we will speak on your behalf.' Scabs! In real-ity, ten or so worker peasant revolutionary cadre kids are acting as loud-speakers, with the phonograph in the back ... We say our contradictionis not with this group of worker peasant revolutionary cadre kids; theydo not represent us, but another group of people."70 Was Tan's groupcomposed primarily of students with revolutionary parentage?In a September 7 speech in which he acknowledged the growing strength of his op-position, he said, “Another group of people opposes those on the revolu-tionary committee, and they have made some gains in all-out mobilization.Therevolutionary committee stillhas a certain amount of prestigebecauseafter all, it was elected. And it has the ironclad support of a group ofworker, peasant, and revolutionary cadre kids [emphasis added]."71Tan never argued that the revolutionary camp was restricted to stu-dents from red households. Although he saw that group as the naturalleaders in a movement to rid the party of revisionism, others who exhib-ited revolutionary credentials in the course of the movement were wel-comed into the fold. In their earliest wall poster Liu Jing and Tan Lifuwrote,“WemustresolvetorelyontherevolutionaryLefttofirmlyunitewith all forces that can be united, like the children of workers, poor andlower-middle peasants,revolutionary cadres, revolutionary martyrs,rev-olutionary intellectuals,and all revolutionary teachers and students." Thisemphasizes the“red"classes butexplicitlyexcludes no one and specifi-cally includes students from intellectual backgrounds. Near the end of hisnotoriousAugust 20speech,Tandeclared,“Webelievethatthe vastmajority of the people in our school want revolution and can be revolu-tionary."72The issue was not the party's class line——-both sides agreed on its basiccontent—but its implications for the political circumstances at IndustrialUniversity in the wake of the work team. Tan used it to defend his posi-tion;hiscriticscitedhisuseofittoillustratethathewasviolatingtheparty's policies regarding the conduct of the Cultural Revolution. Thereal issue was power in the school, disguised as a doctrinal argumentover the correct interpretation of the party's class line and the “SixteenPoints.” Despite outward appearances, Tan's speech did not express anunderlying cleavage that divided the students in his school into camps

TheUniversityRed Guardsthat could be interpreted as “conservative” or “radical" with regard tothe status quo; it was a typical majority-minority argument about theschool'sworkteam.

TacticalRadicalism:InvadingtheMinistriesBy late August the campus majority had the upper hand. The minorityfactionsoonachievedabreakthroughwithatacticalinnovationthatenergized itsmovementandeventuallybroughtitthesupportoftheCCRG.73 Minority factions that grew out of large confrontations withwork teams and had strong grievances as a result pioneered this break-through. Two subsequently played a leading role in Beijing. The first wasAeronautics Institute Red Flag, which staged a daring and prolonged sit-in strike at the gates of the Ministry of Defense, behind which lay the of-fices of theNational Defense Science and Technology Commission.Thesecond was Geology Institute East Is Red, which demonstrated repeat-edly at the offices of the Ministry of Geology and eventually invaded thebuildingandoccupiedit.At theAeronauticsInstitute theRedFlagfactionmadelittleheadwayin its effort to push its criticisms of the work team. The majority redguards sheltered work-team head Zhao Ruzhang when he returned tothe campus for a brief self-criticism and greeted him warmly. On August24 the institute's red guards sealed off the school's wall-poster area, pre-vented Red Flag members from entering, and systematically removed allwall posters that criticized Zhaoor other officials in the NationalDefense Science and Technology Commission.In response,Red Flag de-manded a meeting with Zhao,who agreed to meet early the next morn-ing at the commission's offices. The Red Flag delegation arrived at thegates of the Ministry of Defense, through which visitors gained access tothe Technology Commission's offices, but at the appointed time the stu-dents were given a note explaining that Zhao was tied up in a meeting,and that the students should return to campus.The students refused toleave and decided instead to sit down and wait.74Zhao never emerged, and the students stayed. Two days later the dele-gation was being referred to on campus as a “sit-down strike" and“hunger strike,” although it appears that the latter description appliedonlybecause the school's cafeteria workers refused to deliverfood to theparticipants.Back on campus,debates about the action broke out,withopponents labeling the sit-in at the headquarters of the Red Army “an120

DividedatBirthinsult to the nation.”Representatives from the commission met with RedFlag leaders on campus to try to get them to call off the demonstration,buttheschool'sredguardsdisruptedthemeeting,andnoagreementwasreached. On August 28 military security guards forcibly removed the stu-dents from a small room they had occupied, and workers from the cam-pus threatened to forcibly remove the protesters.A delegation from theGeology Institute's minority faction,East Is Red,arrived to expresssupport.7sAtaroundthistimecopiesofTanLifu'sspeechwerecirculatedoncam-pus, inspiring the majority faction to take a more aggressive stance. OnSeptember 2 the head of the school's preparatory committee held a massrally and called for dragging out “rightists” in Red Flag. In response, RedFlag held a rally of its entire membership,after which most of themmarched downtown to join the sit-in. For the next week the majority fac-tioncontinuedtothreatenRedFlag,whileofficialsfromtheNationalDe-fense Science and Technology Commission tried unsuccessfully to hammerout an agreement to end the protest.On September 9 Zhou Enlai inter-venedtodefusetheconfrontation.Heordered ZhaoRuzhangandothercommission officials to meet with the protesters at the gates,but redguards aligned with the school's preparatory committee intercepted Zhao,and the meeting never took place. On September 14 Zhou Enlai sent thesecretary general of his State Council Office, Zhou Rongxin, to meet withthe Red Flag protesters and express the premier's concern.76The Aeronautics Red Flag protest occurred simultaneously with a muchlarger and more dramatic oneby the GeologyInstitute'sminorityfaction.GeologyEastIsRedgrewrapidlyduringAugustandbytheendofthemonthclaimedcloseto1,oo0members,almostone-fourthoftheschool'sstudents.77 Up to this point the group had been frustrated in its efforts toget work-team head Zou Jiayou back to campus for criticism, so on Au-gust 23 most of the members marched to the Ministry of Geology todemonstrate,demandingthatZoucomeoutsideforaself-criticismandthathe turn over toEastIsRed allfiles containinginformation theworkteam had collected about students. Zou refused and instead bypassed theprotesters and went directly to campus to give a self-criticism in front ofthe more congenial majority faction red guards.78 Foiled in their attemptto confront Zou,EastIs Red organized a second foray to the ministry onSeptember 5. The Geology Institute protesters maintained their siege out-side the ministry offices until September 19, when they invaded and occu-pied thebuilding.

TheUniversityRedGuardsThese attacks on the seats of national power changed the course of theredguardmovement and eventually turned the tideinfavor of minorityfactions across the city.7 Aeronautics Red Flag and Geology East Is Redsurged into the leadership of an emerging “rebel” coalition that quicklygained the unequivocal public support of the CCRG. The radicalism ofthis “rebel" faction, however, was tactical in nature and situational in itsorigins. It did not express an orientation toward the centers of nationalpower that was inherent in the positions of minority activists in the sta-tusquoante.Instead,itexpressedaresponsebytheminorityfaction toitsmembers’experiencesundertheworkteams.Theseactivistswerecompelled to attack the leaders of work teams to reverse the politicalcharges lodged against them and to discredit their rivals in the majorityfaction.Their invasions of ministries to capture the files of the workteams show their preoccupation with the potential consequences of dam-aging materials in their files. The minority factions that led these two at-tacks were from schools where major confrontations had occurred,andwhere large numbers of students had been attacked and labeled as aresult.Schools where major confrontations with work teams had not oc-curred did not organize similar attacks on national centers of power un-til much later, when it was clear that this was sanctioned and even en-couraged by the CCRG. Student rebels from Beijing University, wherethe work team had never faced a serious challenge—and where formerwork-teamcollaboratorswerenowincharge—hadnoreasontosendprotest delegations to central government offices.Also notably absent atthis stage were rebels from Qinghua and Beijing Normal University,where the work teams had already been denounced by central-level offi-cials who visited these campuses and absolved their opponents of allblame.80These attacks on the seats of national power soon changed the tenorand direction of the capital's red guard movement. This shift was sym-bolized by the attacks staged by high-school red guard picket corps onbothAeronauticsRed Flag at theMinistry of Defense and GeologyEastIs Red at theMinistry of Geology.These attackswere surprisingbecausethemilitantstudentsinthesepicketcorpshadbeenamongthemostactive antagonists of the work teams in their own schools and had beenpointedly praised byMao weeks before for their rebellious spirit.As theCCRG threw its weight behind the new university rebels, it repudiated itsformer favorites among the high-school militants, driving the high-school122

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardsUniversity students dominated Beijing's red guard movement, but duringa crucial early period high-school rebels played a highly visible role. Thehigh-school movement,however,developed very differently than in theuniversities.Themost strikingdifferencewas theabsence of a divisionovertheinterventionsoftheworkteams.High-schoolredguardswerenotdivided by debates over the work teams, nor were they locked in rivalriesover control of their schools.Instead,they took their militant activitiesinto the city's neighborhoods. They vandalized temples, museums, andother public places and invaded the homes of vulnerable residents, oftenwith fatal consequences. High-school students were the first to form inde-pendent political groups, and they invented a new name, hongweibing, for“red guards.”For a brief period the high-school militants were praised byMaoandcelebratedasnationalmodels.These students were in the vanguard of the movement in August, butwithintwomonthstheylostfavoraftertheyclashedwithrebelsfromuni-versityminorityfactions and moved into a tacit alliancewith theuniversitymajority. This political trajectory grew out of different encounters withwork teams, which were shaped by the low rank of high schools in thecity'sbureaucratichierarchy,combinedwith the decidedly elitecharacterofmanyofthestudents.The red guards who played this prominent role were, like Beijing's highschools, concentrated in three of the city's ten urban districts. There were52,608 students enrolled inBeijing's urban high schools in the spring of1966.Two-thirds of them attended the seventy-two schools in the coreWestern(Xicheng) and Eastern(Dongcheng) districts,where governmentoffices and their residential blocks were concentrated, and the HaidianDistrict, where most universities were located. The most politically active

students were in the elite high schools that sent high percentages of gradu-atestouniversities.Theseincludedtwentyhighschoolsdesignatedas“keypoints” for academic excellence by the city government, seventeen ofwhichwereintheWesternandEasterndistricts.Asimilarnumberofelitehigh schools were attached to major universities, almost all of which werein Haidian.1 These were the breeding ground for the militant red guardswho had a major impact on the early course of the Cultural Revolution inBeijing.

WorkTeamsintheHighSchoolsMembers of China’s party, government, and military elite were concen-trated in the same residential districts as Beijing's high schools. Childrenfrom these families attended the best primary and middle schools, wereexposed to high parental expectations, and were given preference in a com-petitive admissions process.2 They entered the best schools at high ratesand made up much higher percentages of their student bodies than theydid in the universities, which drew on a much larger national pool ofapplicants.ThecontrastisevidentifwecompareQinghuaUniversitywithQinghuaHighSchool.Mostofthehouseholdsheadedbyofficialswerelabeled“rev-olutionary” on the basis of their membership in the Communist Party orthe Red Army before its victory in 1949. They constituted a very small per-centage of the population—only 2.4 percent nationwide, and 4.4 percent inurban areas.3 At Qinghua University only 7 percent of the students camefrom these elite “revolutionary” households, but at Qinghua High Schoolthefigurewas 25percent.4The elite backgrounds of these students contrasted sharply with the lowrank of the cadres wholed the work teams.High-school work teams wereorganized by the national Secretariat of the Communist Youth League,which dispatched them to each of the city districts.In turn,they sent“work groups” of ten to fifteen municipal- or district-level cadres to eachof the high schools.

The High-School Red Guardsabout committing political errors and were wary of clashes with studentswhose parents outranked them.If they criticized recalcitrant students, theydidsoselectivelyandhesitatedtolodgeseriouspolitical charges.Fromtheperspective of militant students from elite households, work-group cadreswere far from intimidating.Events in the high schools cannot be documented to the degree possiblefor universities.High-school students wrote much less about their experi-ences, and the work groups did not play an important role in defining theinpoliticalviewpoints.It is nonetheless possible to characterizekey events atseveral of the more influential high schools. Even in this limited sample it isclear that just as in universities, events unfolded in a variety of ways. Thedifferences are evident in four case histories:“Western”High School, anelite school in the Western District; Beijing Normal Girls’ High School;Beijing University High School; and Qinghua University High School. Thelast two spawned red guard organizations praised by Mao Zedong, andthelastiswidelycredited asthebirthplaceoftheredguardmovement.

"Western"High SchoolEvents at the elite “Western” High School were described to me in an in-terview with the head of the school's work group.5 This man (referred toby the pseudonym Gao) joined the party in 1949 and ended up as a cadreinthestreetaffairsofficeofacitydistrict.Likemanyothercadressuddenlymobilized for work-team service in early June, Gao had spent much of thepreceding two years on a work team in the Beijing suburbs, conducting theSocialist Education Movement in rural villages. On June 9,1966,alongwithseveraldozencolleagues,hewasabruptlyorderedtoreporttotheWesternDistrictworkteam,headedbyanofficialfromtheCommunistYouth League Secretariat named Hu Qili.6After the publication of Nie Yuanzi's wall poster on June 2 high-schoolstudents attacked their school officials both verbally and physically, andwork groups were sent in an effort to keep order. Gao learned that hewas to be assigned to Western High, which was a difficult assignment.The first work group had already retreated from the school after harrow-ingconfrontationswithviolentstudents.Gaorecognizedclearlythedangers inherent in the assignment. First, handling students from elitebackgroundswouldbe difficult:I did not want to go.

The students did not listen to anyone, not the teachers, not the lead-ers, not the work team, not anyone ...Almost all the students took part,but the most active were the kind of people who later became red guardschildren of cadres, good class background.In addition, it was difficult to curtail violence and exercise authoritywithout appearing to obstruct the CulturalRevolution:“Our task was toget students to rebel in an organized way. No beatings, no jet plane,'7use peaceful methods of criticism and struggle.” Gao held a mass meet-ing and read out a document about how to conduct the movement prop-erly.8He then organized small-group discussions led by work-group mem-bers andyouthleagueleaderstogetthe students to“cooldown."He alsohad to establish control over the imprisoned school officials, whom thestudents had already beaten badly by the time the work group arrived.We allowed students to freely criticize the top party officials and teachers,we just would not let them beat them ... The students had already set up aprison in the basement of one of the school buildings where they had im-prisoned the “black gang” and beat them—the party secretary, principal,teachers.

We did notrelease them from the prison...We could not because otherwise we wouldbe opposing themass movement and opposing the Cultural Revolution.Wedidnotletthemout ofjailbutwe alsodidnot letthestudentstake them outtobeatthem.By walking thispolitical tightrope Gao'sworkgrouprestored a semblanceof order, but within a month he was forced to confront unruly studentswho continued to challenge the work group. “There was one group of stu-dents in the school, children of army officers...They were very fierce anddid not listen to us at all." In late June work teams across the city begancounterattacks against challengers, and Gao was pressured to act deci-sivelyatWesternHigh:TheYouthLeagueCentral Committeecriticized usforbeing too soft on thiskind of student.

The more violent of the two seized and imprisoned the members ofthe work group and proceeded to torture them.Red guards also brokeintothemakeshiftjailwheretheschoolleaderswereheldandbeattwoofthem to death.9 Later that night two other prisoners hanged themselves.

Beijing Normal Girls'High SchoolLocated not far from Tiananmen Square and the Zhongnanhai leadershipcompound, Beijing Normal Girls' High School had a very elite clientele.11Close to half of its students were the offspring of high party officials. Bothof Mao's daughters graduated from this school, and when the CulturalRevolution began, both Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping had daughtersthere (Liu Tingting and Deng Rong). On June 2, the day the Beida wallposter was publicized, the first wall poster attacking school authorities128

ClassandViolenceappeared. The first-named author was Song Binbin, whose father, SongRenqiong, was on the Central Committee.12 The school's teachers warnedstudents not to criticize schoolofficialsand reminded them of thefate ofcritics during the 1957 anti-rightist campaign. But students with highlyplaced parents had a clearer sense of the political winds. The work grouparrived the next day, declared its support for Song Binbin's wall poster, re-moved the school's leaders, and invited students to criticize them. Thework group formed a committee to take control of the school. The workgroup's head chaired the committee,and Song Binbin and the other au-thors of the school's first wall poster became vice-chairmen. Liu Tingtingand Deng Rong were selected to represent their classes, and three of theother representatives were also daughters of high officials.The entire school was swept up in a campaign against the school's topofficials. The primary victim was Bian Zhongyun, party general branchsecretary. Bian had joined the party in 1938 and had served in commu-nistbase areas,butwitha college degree andafather who owned asmallbank, she was vulnerable to suspicion. The work group held a series ofdenunciation meetings against her and printed a collection of wall-posteraccusations. At one such meeting, on June 23, she was beaten severelyShe wrote a letter of protest to the Party Center in which she did not re-fute the political charges but stated that veteran revolutionaries shouldnotbebeateninthisfashion.On July 3 the work group submitted a report that labeled Bian an anti-party, anti-socialist element, and two days later it met with Deng Xiao-ping,along with Song Binbin and several other students,and Hu Qili, whoheaded the Western District work team. During the meeting Deng broughtupBianZhongyun'sletterofcomplaintandaskedwhethershehadinfactbeen beaten. He emphasized that such beatings were forbidden and sug-gested more lenient verdicts for many of the school's officials and teacherswho had been charged with serious political errors.13Accounts from the school mention no challenges to the work group,which carried out a purge with the cooperation of student rebels,manyof whom were daughters of top national officials. Nonetheless, after Maodenounced the work teams,the school's work-groupleaders were seizedand subjected to struggle sessions, during which they were beaten andhad their heads shaved. On July 31 students who had served under theworkgroupformed a red guard unit and established aCultural Revolutionpreparatory committee. On August 5 Bian Zhongyun was beaten to deathat the school, the first recorded red guard murder in Beijing.TheHigh-SchoolRedGuards

BeijingUniversityHighSchoolThe work group dispatched to Beida High School faced a stubborn groupof students, led by children of high officials, who organized one of the firstred guard organizations in the city, Beida High School Red Flag. The groupwas a headache for Shen Ning, who headed the school's work group.14 RedFlag began by organizing struggle sessions against students from nonrevo-lutionary households who had penned wall posters critical of party lead-ers.15Its members alsopressed for recognition of their organization and a“revolutionary committee”tolead the movement in their school.Neitherwas acceptable to the work group, which did not want students to attackoneanother andwouldnottolerateindependentorganizations.Shen Ning tried to split the group and isolate its leaders. Work-groupmembersvisitedparentstotellthemthattheirchildrenwereflirtingwithtrouble. They told the father of Niu Wanping, one of the founders of RedFlag, that his son was simply confused and was under the influence ofGong Xiaoji, who had a questionable character, and Peng Xiaomeng,whose father, despite revolutionary credentials, was politically unreli-able.16 Although the attempt to split Niu from Gong and Peng failed,most other Red Flag leaders were persuaded. Red Flag got the meeting itdemanded with the work group,but when its members arrived,manyformer comrades now argued the work group's side. The membership ofRed Flag shrank from 300 to around 100. The departing members, allfrom “revolutionary” families, aligned themselves with the work group'sversion of the correct course and eventually established a separate orga-nization, the Beida High School Red Guards.17The remaining leaders of Red FlagNiu Wanping, Peng Xiaomeng, andGong Xiaoji—persisted in their struggle. They were angered by the veiledthreat that their organization was anti-party. They abandoned the plan fora revolutionary committee but resented Shen Ning's insinuation that theirmotiveswereimpure.Theywerealsoupsetthattheywerenotselectedtolead the school's picket corps. They appealed directly to Zhang Cheng-xian,headoftheBeidaworkteam,foraffirmationthattheystillwerecon-sidered revolutionary leftists. They demanded a meeting with Zhang, whostalled them and sent out vice-head ZhangDehua instead.Red Flag stagedan overnight sit-in on July 8 until it received a meeting, at which ZhangChengxian brushed the group off with a fatherly admonition to stick toparty policy.18 Shortly thereafter the work team ordered Shen Ning to dis-bandRedFlag.19130

QinghuaUniversityHighSchoolThe Qinghua High School Red Guards—even more prominent in subse-quent events than Beida High Red Flag—emerged from similar conflictswith their school's work group. This group has the double distinction ofinventing the new term for “red guard”used during the Cultural Revo-lution (hongweibing) and of forming the first independent student orga-nizationinthecity.Manyofitsmemberswerethechildrenofofficialswho had joined the Communist Party before its victory in 1949.22 WellbeforetheCulturalRevolutionschoolauthoritiesclashedwithpoliticallyenthusiasticandoutspokenstudentswhowereinfluencedbytranscriptsof brief talks that Mao had given on the subject of education, and thatwere assigned and discussed by the party authorities in the school's polit-ical study classes.23 In a discussion with his nephew Mao Yuanxin, Maoemphasized that in addition to the regular school curriculum, “class strug-gle” was also an important course.24 Shortly afterward, in a talk with hisgrandniece Wang Hairong, a student of English at Beijing Normal Insti-tute,Mao expressed irritation about all the rules and regulations in theeducational system and encouraged her to rebel against them.25 As earlyas the fall of 1964 the idealistic and ambitious Qinghua students soontried to apply these lessons in ways that caused frictions with schoolleaders.They began to complain that the school's curriculum was toorigid and rule bound and its political content toowatered down.They ar-gued that there was an ongoing class struggle within their school, a claimtheleadersdenied.InOctober1965LuoXiaohaiputupawallposterthat called for rebellion against the school's rules and regulations,false"idols"”fabricated by the school authorities.26These long-simmering frictions came to a head in May 1966. On May10 Luo Xiaohai put up another wall poster, this time accusing the school

131

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardsauthorities of ignoring Mao Thought and trying to divert the CulturalRevolution into a meaningless academic exercise, and the next day a groupof his classmates criticized the party secretary's report on the school's Cul-tural Revolution as too conservative and called for a campaign to criticizethe school's leadership.27 They demanded that students take action, stoplistening meekly to school authorities, and attack the bourgeois line in ed-ucation followed at the school.28 OnMay 20, two other students accusedschool authorities of following a bourgeois educational line and of sup-pressing student criticism.They stressed that the students who clashed withthe school authorities were student cadres and political activists. They ad-dressed a copy toChairmanMao and submitted it throughtheCentralCommittee's reporting system.29These students were still an embattled minority, and during the lastweek of May they were under increasing pressure. Cadres in the schoolreminded them that critics of thepartyhadbeenvictimizedin the1957anti-rightist campaign, and classmates who sided with school officials ar-guedwith them constantly.Theymet across the street on the grounds ofthe old Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan) on May 29 and formally estab-lished an organization, giving it a new name, hongweibing, that translatesas “red guard."30 This is thought to be the first student organization of itstype.OnMay31 the group submitted a second report to ChairmanMaoin which it listed twenty political errors committed by the school's partycommittee, including the denial of class struggle and the failure to imple.ment Mao Thought. In a separate letter it told Mao of its struggles withschoolauthorities.31After Nie Yuanzi's wall poster was publicized, the group penned severalwall posters with more serious accusations against its school's party com-mittee.32 Sensing a shift in the political winds, more than 100 studentssigned one of the group's wall posters to signal agreement, but the vast ma-jority of students still supported the party committee.33 After June 1 simi-lar rebellions were brewing on nearby high-school campuses, and on themorning of June 8 more than 300 students from other high schools cametodemonstratetheirsupport.Schoolauthoritiesshuttheschoolgates,butbefore the visitors were expelled, they put up wall posters in support,many of them adopting the name“red guard."34QinghuaHighthereforehad aredguardorganizationwithahistory ofconflict with school authorities even before the arrival of the work group.On June 8 the Haidian District work team dispatched a work group of fif-teenyouth league cadres to the school.In the wake of the purge of132

ClassandViolenceQinghua University's party secretary, the high school's work group sidedwith the red guards.The majority of students reversed their position anddenounced school authorities. The work group convened a series of massdenunciation meetings against the party secretary and other officials. Thered guards grew rapidly,from101 to over300 duringJune,by which pointthey constituted close to 25 percent of the student body.35Despite this initial spirit of cooperation,frictions appeared over thered guards’ plans to organize struggle sessions against “rightist” students,which the work group opposed, and then over the election of a new lead-ershipbody. The work group wanted a revolutionary committee broadlyrepresentative of all students and teachers. The red guards insisted that allthemembersbered guards.In theend,theredguardsdid notget theinway, but one of them was selected as chairman and two others as vice-chairmen.The work group concluded that the red guards had an“incor-rectattitude."36The conflict came to a head on June 24 when the red guards put upwall posters criticizing the previous day's editorialin ChinaYouthNews,the youth league's national paper, that emphasized the “glorious respon-sibility of leftist students” to unite with the vast majority of their class-mates. The wall poster denounced the article's “comproming” attitude.37On the same day they issued a wall poster that expressed support forKuai Dafu and other students at Qinghua University who were under at-tack for criticizing the university's work team.38 The work group consid-ered these wall posters a direct challenge and reported the problem to itssuperiorsontheCommunistYouthLeagueSecretariat,whichordereditto dismantle the red guards. In private meetings in mid-July the two sidesargued for hours.The work group charged that the red guards under-mineditbehinditsbackandthatsomeoftheirleadershadulterior(thatis,“anti-party"）motives.

At the rally Luo Xiaohai andKuang Taosheng read out the text of their two wall posters titled “LongLivetheProletarianSpiritofRevolutionaryRebellion.”Beforeleavingthestage,they gave copies toJiang Qing,along with a brief letter to Chair-man Mao. The letter informed Mao that some people in their school hadsaid that their wall posters were reactionary, and they asked ChairmanMao's opinion. Jiang Qing agreed to relay the material to her husband.41

PoliticalCelebrityUnliketheminorityfactionintheuniversities,whichendedthework-teamperiod under a cloud,high-school students who challenged work groupsbecame political celebrities, singled out by Mao for praise in the nation'smass media. The only university figure named by Mao in the August partyplenum was Beida's Nie Yuanzi,whose “first Marxist-Leninist wallposter” received Mao's fulsome praise.4² Mao met with Nie in the recep-tion room atop Tiananmen during the August 18 red guard rally, a meet-ing publicized in the national media.43 Mao conveniently ignored the factthatNiehadworkedcloselywiththeBeidaworkteamformanyweeks.Surprisingly, Mao did not single out any of the students who led large re-bellions against work teams at the Geology, Aeronautics, and Post andTelecommunicationsinstitutes, and he took nonotice of Kuai Dafu's chal-lenge at Qinghua University. Instead, he singled out high-school rebelswho had been the first to challenge school officials and at most engaged inrelatively muted clashes with work groups.Jiang Qing fulfilled her promise to pass on the Qinghua High RedGuards'wall posters and letters.Mao read them and responded enthusias-tically. He wrote to the group on August 1, affirming that its wall posterswere indeed “revolutionary,” and he applauded its militant stand. He or-dered the two posters, along with his letter, reprinted and circulated to allparticipants at the Eleventh Plenum.44 Mao also took the opportunity toexpresshissupportforBeidaHighRedFlagandpraisedoneofitsleadersfor her speech at one of the Beida mass rallies where Jiang Qing and othermembersoftheCCRGwerepresent.Your two wall posters of June 24 and July 4 express anger and condemnationtoward the oppression of workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals,andrevolutionaryparties andgroups bylandlords,capitalists,imperialists

The existence of the letter and its generalcontentsbecameknownnationwide.46Mao followed up by inviting 1,500 student activists onto the reviewingstands for the first red guard rally in Tiananmen Square on August 18.More than twenty members of the QinghuaHighRed Guards received in-vitations. Luo Xiaohai and two others slipped past security guards and en-tered the main reception building where Mao was standing. They gotwithin earshot of Mao and got his attention. When Luo explained thatthey were from the Qinghua High Red Guards, Mao responded,“I res-olutely support you!" The encounter was written up by the students andpublished afew dayslaterinPeople'sDaily.47Peng Xiaomeng and her Red Flag comrades were also singled out forspecial attention.Pengwas already well known to members of the CCRGMao's praise of her late July speech at Beida was based on a report byJiang Qing, and she had also shared the stage with Jiang at a meeting ofhigh-school red guards on July 28.48 At a mass meeting on August 6, KangSheng praised Peng Xiaomeng personally and expressed his completeagreement with Beida High Red Flag and similar organizations.49 At theAugust 18 Tiananmen rally,Peng chattedbriefly withMaoand gave aspeech to the crowd. The mass media identified her and Red Flag by name,earning them nationwide celebrity.50Also celebrated that day was SongBinbin, who led the red guards of Beijing Normal Girls' High. Song hadpenned the first wall poster to attack authorities at her school, and her fa-ther, Song Renqiong,had just been promoted to alternate membership in

The High-School Red Guardsthe Politburo. A famous photograph of her on the Tiananmen rostrum fit-ting a red guard armband ontoa smilingMao Zedongwas carried on thefront page of newspapers nationwide, along with a news report of herbrief dialogue with Mao. In the following days the national media pub-lished excerpts from speeches by these high-school militants, along withcopies of their wall posters.51

ThePoliticalContextinHighSchoolsFor high-school rebels the political consequences of the work-team pe-riod were very different than in universities. High-school work groupswere small and staffed by ordinary cadres.The most successful of themmaintained a fragile sense of order in their school. Even when they werechallenged, they focused their critical attention on a handful of trouble.makers and largely refrained from lodging serious political accusations.There is scant evidence of the kind of large confrontations seen at theGeology and Aeronautics institutes. High-school work groups thereforedid not lay the groundworkfor future splits.Even atBeida and Qinghuahigh schools, the work groups only sought to isolate the militant leaders,nottomobilizemasscriticism.In the aftermath of the work groups’withdrawal, students who hadclashed with work groups had little reason to fear the consequences. OnJuly 27 and 28 Jiang Qing chaired meetings of high-school students in theHaidian and Western districts and announced the removal of the work-teamheadsof thesetwodistricts,ZhouJie andHuQili,whowereeachput on the stage for a struggle session.2 On August 2 Guan Feng, repre-senting the CCRG, met with students and told them that their red guardorganizations were “completely legal,” and he praised several of them andtheirleadersby name.53Even more dramatic was the purge of the entire leadership of the CentralSecretariat of the Communist Youth League. On August 5 Mao criticizedthe “three Hus"” (Hu Yaobang, Hu Qili, and Hu Keshi) for mishandlingthe work teams, and the next day, at a meeting with red guards at the Tian-qiao Theater, Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng criticized them and demandedthat the national youth league organization be closed down.54 At a massmeeting of high-school activists on August 13, Li Fuchun announced “onbehalf of ChairmanMaoand theParty Center”that theleaders of theCommunist Youth League Central Committee would be purged.55 Imme-diately afterward a wave of students rushed to the homes of Hu Yaobang136

ClassandViolenceandHuKeshi anddraggedthembackto theCentralYouthLeagueofficesfor a struggle session.From this day forward rebellious students occupiedthe youth league's offices. Top officials were detained and forced to partic-ipate in daily mass criticism sessions.56 On August 15 the youth league'sleaders were officially removed from their posts and were forced to tourlocal high schools, denouncing the work groups’ errors and praising theredguards.57There was little reason for high-school militants to mount the kind ofcampaign pushed by the university minority against the higher officialswhohad sent theirwork teams—theyhad alreadybeenforced frompowerin disgrace.Unlike their university counterparts,high-school militants didnot argue over control of their campuses. Instead, they competed to provetheir revolutionary mettle by engaging in an array of “revolutionary ac-tions” in the public places and neighborhoods of the city. Whatever differ-ences they might have had under the work groups were quicklyforgottenasthemovementshiftedtoanewphase.Other issues soon divided high-school students. The first was a debateabout class origin as a qualification for membership in and leadership overthe red guards. The second was a dispute about the proper conduct of redguards,especiallytheuseofviolence.Acommonmisperceptionoftheearlyhigh-school red guards is that they were uniformly chauvinistic studentswho were proud of their “revolutionary” family heritage, looked down onthose from other backgrounds, and had a singular propensity for violence.The early high-school movement was indeed violent and dominated by stu-dents from“revolutionary”and other “red”family origins.However,theissue of class heritage and especially the question of violence served to di-vide studentrebelsfrom thefavored“revolutionary”and“red”families

TheQuestionofClassOriginThe debate about class origin was spurred by the appearance of a deroga-tory rhyme, a“couplet”(duilian) that praised students of revolutionaryparentage and denigrated those from “bad" family origins. The debate wasessentially about the relationship of the couplet to the party's “class line,"whichenshrined officialdiscrimination againstthosefrom exploiting-classor “reactionary”political background and privileged those from“red" andespecially“revolutionary”households.The Cultural Revolution was launched as part of a militant reassertionof the party's class line.Thefirst attacks against educational officials had

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardslabeled them “revisionist” because they gave too much prestige and au-thoritytoacademicsfrombourgeoisbackgrounds andpermitted studentsfrom reactionary backgrounds to advance at the expense of those from“red” classes. Emblematic of this revisionism was a policy attributed toPeng Zhen, the Beijing party secretary purged in May 1966: “emphasizeperformance”(zhong zaibiaoxian)was said to express a neglect of theclass line.This had been a central point of contention atBeida since theSocialistEducationMovement,anditwas atthecoreofNieYuanzi'scri-tiqueofBeidaauthorities.The offending couplet originated in early August at Aeronautics InstituteHigh School. The controversial core was a two-line rhyme that praised theoffspring of revolutionaries and insulted the offspring of “reactionaries."58The students defended it as an expression of the party's class line:Demons see this and worry [gui jian chou]It is basically like this [jiben ruci]:The son of a revolutionary is a hero [laozi geming er haohan]Thesonof areactionaryisabastard[laozifandongerhundan]The couplet was actually a gross caricature of the party's class line,whichclaimedasabasicprincipleofclassanalysisthatfamilyclassher-itage influenced political loyalty. Those from families headed by formerrevolutionaries or exploited classes would tend to be more loyal becausetheybenefitedfromtherevolution.Thosefromfamiliesheadedbymem-bers of exploiting social classes or reactionary political parties were hurtbytherevolution andpotentiallysubjecttoreactionaryinfluencesandhad to work harder to develop the proper political consciousness. Thosefromhouseholdsheadedbyformermembersofthemiddleclassesfellsomewhere in between—a wavering stratum that supported whicheverside appeared to be winning.59The couplet was provocative in several ways. First, it appeared to sug-gest that the children of revolutionaries were a hereditary political aris-tocracy, assumed to be “red" by birth. Second, it insulted students fromless favored backgrounds by suggesting that they were damned at birthregardless oftheir actualloyalties.Third,it ignored those with“red"her-itage in the working class and poor peasantry, who had benefited from therevolution but whose parents were not revolutionary “heroes.” Studentsfrom these backgrounds—the working class and peasants, the middleclass, and “bad” classes—were in the majority, even in elite high schools.and many were political activists and student cadres.60 Not surprisingly.138

ClassandViolencemany students,including thosefrom revolutionaryhouseholds,began tocriticize the couplet as discriminatory, politically self-defeating, and con-trarytotheparty'sclassline.Students at Aeronautics High School defended their creation in a waythat exacerbated the controversy.“Most of those with good class origin,the vast majority, are revolutionary ... but there is a small group of trai-tors among them.Those little sons of bitches with bad class origin aremostly not revolutionary, or stand alongside those with counterrevolu-tionary standpoints. Only a minority of them, after thoroughly betrayingtheir families, are able to stand on the side of the revolution."61 This wasnot likely to quell the critics.ArgumentsovertheissueescalatedintoviolenceamongredguardsonAugust 2. On that day students from Qinghua High and Beijing HighSchool No. 47 went together to the Western District to hold a meeting ontheathleticfieldofanotherhighschool.Soonafterthemeetingbeganred guards began arguing over the microphone. Those from proletarianhouseholdsclaimed that they shouldgofirstbecause the“workingclassleadsall."Thosefromrevolutionaryhouseholdsarguedthattheyde-servedprioritybecausetheir parentshad actually shed blood toliberate thecountry.A student named TangWei spoke out and criticized the stu-dents’ obsession with parentage. Tang Wei's late father, however, hadbeen a “historical counterrevolutionary,” and for this Tang was draggedoff the stage to a rear courtyard for a struggle session and severe beating.Hismother,whotaught attheschool,was draggedoutforsimilartreat-ment. That evening Tang Wei got together with some friends and, armedwithknives,trackeddownandstabbedsomeofhistormentorsoutsidetheschool.62Apparently worried that arguments over the couplet would divide andweaken the movement, several members of the CCRG intervened. At anAugust6assemblyJiangQingsaid:Ihaveheardthatyou are allfacing one another down over thiscouplet.Thisis easy to resolve...Iwould like to talk about where this line“the son of ahero is a real man” comes from. There is a Beijing opera called Lianhuantao,have you seen it? (The audience answers, no; Jiang Qing laughs)... Ifwe get all tangled up in a question like this,wewill never move forward...We think revising it like this is appropriate: The sons of revolutionariesshould succeed them,the sons of reactionaries should betray them; this istheideal.63

139

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardsJiang moved on to explain the correct version of the party's class line:“Inthinking about a person,first you must look at their class standpoint,thisis the basic question.Second,do not look only at class status; this referstoindividuals from a certain class whobetray their original class. Third,emphasize performance in terms of political thought, not just appear-ances."Kang Sheng spoke next, but his advice must have seemed confusing.First, he strongly defended the party's class line as the essence of the Cul-tural Revolution. “In the past, under the Peng Zhen-Lu Dingyi blackgang that opposed the proletarian line in education, in all the schools thevast majority of children of workers,peasants, and revolutionary cadreswere discriminated against, persecuted, and you comrades suffereddeeply from this persecution. It was very good that you comrades raisedthis question to express your resistance and resolute opposition to thispersecution .. . and advocate rebellion." Kang then said that although itwas absolutely correct to emphasize the class line, the “class-line policy”was to “unite with the vast majority.” Without unity,Kang explained,the concept of proletarian leadership was empty.64 Kang appeared to bewarningtheredguardsagainstneedlesslyalienatingthemajorityofstu-dents who did not come fromfavored revolutionary backgrounds.How-ever,Kangdidnotaddressthecentralquestionofhowimportantclassorigin should be in considering individuals for membership in the redguards.The debate over the couplet ensnared other figures on the CCRG. WhenQiBenyureportedthedebatetoChenBoda,Chenofferedarevisionthatwas similar to Jiang Qing's: "The son of a hero will succeed him, the sonof a reactionary will rebel against him; this is the ideal."” Red guard dele-gations visited the joint State Council-CCRG reception center during Au-gust to ask officials to clarify their stance on the couplet.When a StateCouncil official at the reception center (Xu Ming, a member of Zhou En-lai's State Council staff) offered Chen Boda's new version as an alternative,theredguardsobjectedandaskedonwhoseauthoritytheweakerversionwasoffered.WhentoldthatitwasChenBoda,thestudentsangrilydemanded that he retract it. Chen was alarmed when he heard of the episode,and he accused Xu Ming of deliberately goading red guards into attackinghim.65 Chen was therefore on his guard during an August 24 visit to Beida.When a student asked him point-blank whether the red guards should be"primarily” or “exclusively” made up of students from red family origin,Chen refused to answer, saying, “You talk it over."66140

ClassandViolenceThe members of the Qinghua High Red Guards were themselves predominantly from “red” classes, especially revolutionary cadres, and theybecamemoresoovertime.Of thefirst1oomembersontheeveofthework group's arrival, two-thirds were from“red"—primarily cadre—background.67In the wake of the work group's departure,the rapid ex-pansion of the movement led the organization to be more attentive to therevolutionary purity of its new members as a means of enforcing unityand internal discipline: “What kind of organization are the red guards?Thevastmajority of themare children of cadres who comefromgoodclass backgrounds and have high political consciousness—this is a res-olutely leftist proletarian force."68 By mid-September this increasedemphasisonclassoriginledtoamembershipcompositionthatwas90percent from“red’" households.69 This was a highly skewed membershipprofilebecause only 45percent of the students at the schoolwerefrom“red" households.70 Clearly, this emphasis put “class origin” first, andalso clearly, it did not put “sole emphasis” on class origin—one-third ofthe original membership and 10 percent of the greatly expanded mem-bership were still from households that were not“red."Class discrimi-nationwasnonethelessobvious,andthiscausedcontroversyfromthebeginningThetenor of this debate is evident in the earliestprogrammaticstate-ments about the party's class line. The strong claims to political leader-shipmadeby the offspring of revolutionary cadres at Qinghua andotherhighschools attractedspiritedcriticismfrom others.Thecriticsre-sponded, “What is so special about you worker-peasant-cadre kids?""Workers and peasants are naturally stupid,” and “Cadre kids enjoy highposition and live in comfort; they are thoroughly corrupted!" The redguards’ position, according to the critics, amounted to “not permittingothers to make revolution” and “not uniting with others.” “You use yourstatus to bully people!Arrogant!" After all, “bad class background is justbadluck."71Some red guards took great offense at these arguments, and their re-sponses betrayed defensiveness about their elite status. Their first responsewas to charge that such comments expressed the ideology of defeated so-cialclasseswhohopedforacomebackWe arematerialists.Webelieve thatbeingdetermines consciousness.Doyouactually think that the reactionary consciousness of the exploiting classeswill not have a profound influence on the sons and daughters who have

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardslived togetherwith themforsolong?And thatwe,thesons anddaughtersof the vast majority of workers, poor and lower-middle-class peasants, andrevolutionary cadres, living together with our own families, being educatedby our parents from the time we were small, do not have a simple class feel-ing toward the party and Chairman Mao that is diametrically opposed tothe influences working on the sons and daughters of exploiting classes?72The authors of this essay responded that they were the ones who hadstood up and rebelled against the school's partybranchevenbefore thearrival of the work group: “During this Cultural Revolution, in the midstof this fierce class struggle, the children of workers, peasants and revolu-tionarycadresperformedespecially actively,especiallybravely...Butsomany of the sons and daughters of the exploitingclasses stood along-side the reactionary standpoints of their parents and were not of the samemind as us. In light of these facts, who can you rely on if not the childrenof workers,peasants, and revolutionary cadres?” After all, they argued,back when this all started, when the party branch was still in power,where were their critics?“At the outset when the black gang was inpower and they suppressed us so badly we could not hold our heads up,how ferocious you were! Back then, why did you not let loose even a sin-glefart?"73The authors argued that their position was not a distortion of theparty's class line but a correct application of it. "When we look at a per-son, first, we look at their class status; this is essential, the primary ques-tion.Second,wedonotplacesoleemphasis on class status(you cannotreverse the order of thefirst and second).Third,emphasizeperformance.This refers to the various class elements betraying their own class."74 Thewording of this statement accurately reflects the standard interpretationof the party's class line. Whether the red guards’ interpretation of theprinciples was fully in accord with their spirit, however, is as mani-festly unclear as the inherently contradictory principles themselves,which essentially say,“Discriminate according to class origin, but do notoverdoit."The debate about class origin clearly touched a sensitive nerve amongpolitically active students.The ambiguity of the basic policy and the con-tradictory pronouncements of officials who sought to clarify it did nothingtoresolvethecontroversy.ManyearlyredguardsfollowedthepracticeatBeijing No. 1 High School, where students from “red" background wereconsidered “leftists” and were permitted to join, while most students from142

ClassandViolencemiddle-class households were steered into an affliated “red auxiliary."75Althoughthisdebateflaredduringthelatesummerof1966,itdidnotde-fine factional alignments in the high schools. These early red guards hadno organized rivals.The public praise showered upon them by the CCRGand Mao, and their political backing and elite connections, deterred otherstudents from an organized challenge.

TheIssueofRedGuardViolenceAmore seriousdivisionwas over theissue ofviolence.This issue,evenmore than the issue of class origin, went to the very identity and aims ofthe red guard movement. This was a division among the original “old"red guards, the vast majority of whom were from “red” and especially"revolutionary” households. It did not develop into an open factional di-vide, but a vocal minority expressed strong criticisms of the chaos andviolence of the month of August. This sentiment found organized expres-sion in red guard“picket corps”(jiucha dui) in theWestern,Eastern,and Haidian districts, whose initial purpose was to curtail random vio-lence and provide discipline to an anarchic and rapidly growing movement.The picket corps failed in this mission, but in pursuing it they became en-tangled in the conflict between university factions at a crucial turningpointintheirstruggleA wave of unrestrained violence swept over the city as soon as workgroups were withdrawn. High-school students seized party secretaries,principals,teachers,andclassmates andsubjectedthemtoviolentbeat-ings.Those who died as a direct result were a small percentage of thosewho suffered such mistreatment.Atleast eighthigh-school party secre-taries,principals,or vice-principals were murdered or committed suicideduring August.76 Teachers and other administrators bore the brunt of theassault; suicide and beating deaths were common, and in some schoolsseveral died in a single day.77High-school militants also charged off campus to attack targeted indi-viduals. On August 19 red guards from Beijing High Schools Nos. 4, 6,and 8 held struggle sessions in the amusement hall of Zhongshan Park,nexttoTiananmen.Theytargetedthirteenofficialsintheeducationalandyouthleague system andbeat them severely.78OnAugust 23 redguards took old theatrical costumes stored in the Cultural Bureau, piledthem in the courtyard of the Confucian Temple, and set them ablaze.They conducted a struggle session against some thirty figures, including

His corpse was found float-ing in a nearby lake the next morning.79Although the influence of family heritage on a student's political qualifications was controversial, attacks on the families of “reactionaries” werenot. The last half of August saw a wave of attacks on residents with “bad"class backgrounds.Red guards roamed the city's residential streets,terror-ized members of these households, invaded their homes, and subjected theoccupants to violent struggle sessions. During this period red guards issuedhandbillsthatmadetwokindsofdemands.Thefirstwasthattheownersof courtyard homes in the old neighborhoods in the city center move intosmaller quarters and stop charging rent to tenants. One typical handbilldeclared:Capitalist realestate owners (landlords),“respected"gentlemen and ladiesyou are bastards, sons of bitches. The vast majority of you are s.o.b. blackelements (landlord,rich peasant,counterrevolutionary,bad elements,rightists,etc.).Before liberation you sucked our blood and sweat,fed off ourflesh and blood, acted like tyrants, committing every imaginable crime; youaretrulymaggots,leeches.After liberationyou stillhave a stronglittle capitalist empire, taking rent, defying state regulations by raising rents, avoid-ing bankruptcy by oppressing your tenants (worker and peasant origins),truly despicable.Today, on behalf of the broad masses of workers, peasants,and soldiers,we openfire onyou!The notice demanded that all landlords in theneighborhood turn overtheir property to the government within ten days.80Even more serious were red guard demands that all exploiting class andreactionary households be expelled from the city immediately. Red guardsfrom Beijing High School No. 4, located in the core of the old Western Dis-trict, demanded that all households headed by “four type elements” (land-lords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements) leave thecity by September 10. They declared that they would visit neighborhoodpolice stations to checkhousehold registration records to ensure compli-ance with these “regulations."81 The red guards of Beijing No. 2 HighSchool were even more insistent. They ordered “all five black elements” toleave Beijing immediately. They asserted that members of these householdsthreatened public order, created disturbances on the streets, and hung out144

ClassandViolencein bars and teahouses all day. Their presence in the nation's capital was in-tolerable.82The red guards also attacked hobbies and consumer habits that theyassociated with the capitalist class. One handbill notified all bookstores,hobby shops, post offices, and printing plants that they had seventy-twohours to“destroy allenvelopes,stamps,book covers,paintings,posters,magazines,etc.that promotebourgeois consciousness.”They called on"all red guard comrades” to help enforce these regulations and warned,"Those who fail to comply will be responsible for the consequences!"83Red guards from another school denounced stamp collecting as a bour-geois hobby and demanded that it be stopped, and that all materials leftover from the old society be destroyed within forty-eight hours.84 Redguards from Beijing High School No. 2 denounced bourgeois influences inclothing shops,used bookstores,barbershops,beauty shops, and photogalleries. They forbade foreign hair and clothing styles and demanded ahalt to sales of denim cloth and foreign books. These items were all part ofa plot by the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism, and “bourgeois bastards"muststopimmediately.85In identifying the homes of alien class elements, red guards were as-sisted bypublic security forces.At ameeting of theBeijing Bureau ofPublic Security in late August, Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi toldofficials, “We should not be restrained by existing regulations, whetherthey are national laws or public security bureau rules ... The civilian po-lice must stand alongside the red guards, get in touch with them, estab-lish a close relationship, brief them on local conditions, and tell themabout the local five bad elements.” The speech served as a directive to helpred guards identify the homes of “bad classes."86 Members of these house-holds assembled on high-school grounds and neighborhood parks forstruggle sessions and beatings. Processions of victims being driven throughthe streets in the backs of trucks were a common sight.87 In the month fol-lowing the first Tiananmen rally on August 18,114,0oo homes weresearched, and 44.8 million yuan of foreign currency, gold, and other valu-ables were confiscated, along with more than 2.3 million books and 3.3million paintings, art objects, and pieces of furniture. In the Western Dis-trict,thebooks,paintings,scrolls,and otheritems confiscatedfrom1,061homes were set ablaze and burned for eight days and nights. During this pe-riod 77,0o0 people were expelled from their homes in the urban and innersuburban districts.88 The violence crested during the last week of August,

145

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardswhen an average of more than 200 people were dying every day. The offi-cial Beijing death toll for the month after August 18 was 1,772.89

RedGuardDenunciationsofViolenceSome red guards objected strongly tothese events.One of the firstprotests came on August 6, well before the violence crested. A jointproclamation issued by red guards from Qinghua, People's University,and Beijing Aeronautics high schools was a direct response to the eventsat theAugust 2rallywhereviolence erupted and led to a revenge stab-bing.The “UrgentAppeal"began:Very recently, a series of extremely serious erroneous incidents have ap-peared in the Cultural Revolution movement in Beijing's high schools.Asmall group of bastards and a bunch of incompetents who do not obeyChairmanMaohavedonned therevolutionarygarbof suchleftist organizations asRed Guards andRed Flag and,waving thebanner of rebellion,havepublicly defied Chairman Mao's instructions,publicly violated party policy,publicly violated the discipline of the dictatorship of the proletariat andcommunist moral character, and have suppressed and attacked revolution-ary masses who have different opinions, going around everywhere beatingpeople up, injuring a good many good people and children of workers, peas-ants, and revolutionary cadres, destroying offices and schools, carrying onlike gangsters . . . You who wildly smash things without regard to right andwrong are gangsters, truly low-level; what kind of leftism is this? You arefake leftists, fake Red Guards, fake Red Flag!90The appeal stated that “genuine leftist organizations in the various schoolsmustuniteandtakeimmediatelyeffectiveactiontostrictlycontrolindis-criminate beatings and gangster-like behavior that destroys state prop-erty."Those who committed such acts must bekicked out of all red guardorganizations. “"We children of workers, peasants, and revolutionary cadresabsolutely must not damage the party's lifeblood."91The Qinghua High School Red Guards,unhappy about the move-ment as it expanded during August, issued a series of criticisms andcalls for greater discipline and restraint. Several days after its“UrgentAppeal" it issued a long critique of arrogant behavior among red guardleaders and called for red guards to “become a highly revolutionized,battle-hardened force like the People's Liberation Army." To achieve146

ClassandViolencethis unity and discipline,it was necessary to be selective in admittingmembers: “What kind of organization are the red guards? The great ma-jority of its members are sons and daughters of revolutionary cadres withgood class background and high consciousness."92Mao initially welcomed the “Urgent Appeal" and had it printed and cir-culated to delegates to the Eleventh Plenum, which was still in session.93On August 13,with the support of the Municipal Party Committee, redguards staged a mass meeting at the BeijingWorkers'Stadium to denounceviolent “hooligans” among the red guards. Three high-school red guardswhohadbeen involved in therecentrevenge stabbingwerebeaten duringa struggle session, and similar incidents occurred sporadically at severalschools in the following days.94These efforts were ineffective, and the wave of violence crested in lateAugust. Near the end of the month the Qinghua High Red Guards issuedanother criticism of the red guard movement titled “Ten-Point Assess-ment.”The document began,“In the midst of such a tumultuous and his-toricallyunprecedentedmovementastheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution,it is unavoidable that the red guards will exhibit some short-comings and errors.” Then it moved to the main point—violence.We must absolutely not beat people, and even if anti-party, anti-socialistrightists initiate the violence,we should notbeatthem...We red guardsshould be modest and prudent, stick to principles, respect comrades, andcorrectly resolve contradictions among the people. We absolutely must notbe arrogant and domineering, impervious to reason, like a tiger whose back-sideyou dare not touch,actingwithutter disregardforhumanlife,beatingpeople to death,flying into a rage when contradicted and beating people.This is thebehavior of GuomindangFascists,of local tyrants,absolutely notthebehavior of genuinered guardsfrom thefivered classes!95Red guard organizations should be disciplined and unified, “with five-redsons and daughters as the core,” prevent individuals from becoming toopowerful,regularly use criticism and self-criticism to correct errors, andguard against becoming arrogant and overbearing.Red guards shouldalsostrive tounitewith thevastmajority of students:With regard to thosefrom non-five-red households,our own experienceshows that after being tested in struggle and thoroughly remolding them-selves we can unite with the vast majority of them. We cannot just call all ofTheHigh-SchoolRedGuards

147them “sons of bitches.” The purpose of uniting with them is to remoldthem.A minority of them, if their political performance is good, and if theyare loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and the party's class line,can become redguards.Eventhosewhowereunabletojointheredguardscouldstillberevolu-tionary and should be encouraged to participate in the movement. The doc-umentalsowarnedagainst“deviations”inthecampaignagainstremnantsoftheoldsociety andculture.When some people see braids that are a little long, they cut them off and evenshave the heads of female comrades.Some people indiscriminately searchhomes, no matter whose they are, and even create an uproar at the homes ofrevolutionary cadres,without any sense of class nature;this is ahuge error,and we must pay serious attention to this. Some people will not let shops sellcakes, only steamed buns. And some gangster elements, using smashing the"four olds” as an excuse, engage in all kinds of gangster-like sabotage activi-ties. These must be stopped!96The Qinghua High Red Guards and their allies were groping towardan alternative model for the red guards. The template for militant studentactivities was Mao's 1927 “Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan."That essay described an upsurge of violent peasant retribution againstlandlords, including the tumultuous and spontaneous“struggle sessions”that students imitated as their primary public act of rebellion.Maopraised these outbursts as essential in advancing the revolutionary pro-cess, and he ridiculed party members who feared such spontaneity andclaimed that this was “going too far." Mao argued that this should bewelcomed, and that it was a test for party members to see which of themwere truly revolutionary.97These red guards offered a different revolutionary model, the People'sLiberation Army, whose ideals stressed discipline, unity, careful attentiontoparty policy,and restrained behavior.They rebuked classmates whomodeled their behavior after peasant uprisings as “gangsters” or “hooli-gans."” In their tabloids they began to emphasize the revolutionary tradi-tion of the army, especially its “Three Rules of Discipline and Eight Pointsof Attention,” which explicitly proscribed beating and cursing people andmistreating prisoners.98 Other red guard organizations echoed theseappeals by calling for emulation of the People's Liberation Army.99148

ClassandViolenceDespite constant rhetoric about“red” heritage, the divisions over vio-lence did notpit studentsfrom one type offamilybackground againstothers. This was a division among students from “red" class backgroundwho dominated the early movement. The appeals of the Qinghua RedGuards were directed to“red class” students like themselves.1oo Thesesplits were evident to students atthe time.A mid-September essaybeganwith an appeal to “all class brothers of five-red family origin” about theubiquitous problem of divisions among the “red’” classes.“Among theseshortcomings and errors, we view one to be especially serious: the problem of unity among various red guard factions that have been formed byclassmates of five-red family origins. Very recently we have done some in-vestigating in several schools andhave discovered thatthey allhave twoor even more factions formed by classmates of five-red family origin."Some divisions were due to “principled differences” over issues “like thework groups,” while others were “personal contradictions" due to indi-vidual rivalry.Elections for revolutionary committees intensified the di-visions.101 Splits among “red-class” red guards at the school level werealso evident citywide. In mid-August high-school red guards argued overthe main goal of the movement. One side, including Beida Red Flag,wanted to curtail attacks on the Communist Youth League Central Com-mittee and hold struggle sessions against “hooligan” students. The otherside, which included the Qinghua High Red Guards, wanted to empha-size discipline and nonviolence while pursuing further attacks on theyouthleague.102

TheMaoistShrugThe calls tocurtailviolenceran directly counter to the attitude ofkey figuresontheCCRGwho,ontherareoccasionswhentheyaddressedtheissue,appeared to view it as a necessaryfeature of rebellion and the suf-fering of victims as acceptable collateral damage. Top officials were inti-matelyinformedoftheviolentcourseofthemovement.TheCCRGestablished anintelligence network of reporters from thePLA newsserv-ice and the New China News Agency that detailed school-level events ina restricted-circulation bulletin.1o3 Near the end of August the MunicipalPartyCommitteeestablishedaRedGuardLiaisonOfficeandproducedasimilar bulletin based on visits to its reception center by red guards andtheirvictims.104

149

TheHigh-SchoolRedGuardsOn the eve of themovement,key CCRG leaders gaveclearsignals thatviolence against victims would not be considered a serious transgression.OnJuly 28,in one of her first speeches to the high-school red guards.JiangQinghadsaid:Ourproletarian dictatorshipis firm;we donotfear chaos.Chaos and orderare inseparable. That would be like a turtle crawling along in a rut, tyingyou up in your own little world, unable to liberate your thinking; it is nogood ... We do not advocate beating people, but beating people is no bigdeal...You cannot beat someone's mistaken thoughts out of them,but forbeatings to occur during a revolutionary outburst is not a bad thing. Chair-man Maohas said,“If good people beat bad people,it serves them right; ifbad people beat good people, the good people achieve glory; if good peoplebeat good people,it is a misunderstanding;without beatings you do not getacquainted and then no longer need tobeat them."105On August 4 neither Jiang Qing nor Kang Sheng objected when mem-bers of Beida High Red Flag whipped the leaders of the Beida work teamwith belts during a denunciation meeting. To the contrary, when thewhipping was over, Jiang smiled and embraced one of the students.106Despite this cavalier attitude, Jiang Qing initially did not object to thered guards’August 6 “Urgent Appeal."However, her attitude soonchanged.Shebecame concernedthat more moderatefigures on theCCRG—particularly Wang Renzhong, who was in charge of the Beijingmovement and who pushed to have the appeal circulated at the EleventhPlenum—were too enthusiastic about its message. She began to suspectthat they were using theissuetolimit the student rebellion.Mao alsoshared this view, and during one meeting when he heard a report aboutthe August 13 mass struggle session against “hooligan” students,hereportedly turned to Wang Renzhong and said, “You and your ‘urgentappeal. *107 Mao was in no mood to let concerns about violence derailstudentmobilization.Near theheightof thewave ofviolence onAugust23, at a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee,he expressed hisimpatience.I do not think Beijing is all that chaotic. Students holding 10o,0o0-personmass meetings, capturing assailants,getting all panicked.Beijing is too civi-lized, hooligans are only a minority, now is not the time to interfere .. .Rushing tomake decisions,getting all worked up.Rushing tostruggle150

ClassandViolenceagainst theleftists,rushingtohold1oo,oo0-person massmeetings,rushingto issue urgent appeals, rushing to say that to oppose the new Municipal PartyCommittee is to oppose the Party Center—why can you not oppose it?108Xie Fuzhi, minister of public security, mirrored Mao's attitude. At thelate August meeting where he directed neighborhood police stations toassist red guards in identifying “reactionary” households,Xie said, “I donot approve of the masses killing people, but the masses' bitter hatred to-ward bad people cannot be discouraged, and it is unavoidable"1o9 As theviolenceintensified,Maosetthetone:the authoritiesshouldturnablindeye to violence as an inevitable by-product of revolutionary mobilization.ThiswastranslatedintoofficialdirectivesonAugust21and22:localarmy units and bureaus of public security were strictly prohibited fromtaking any action against marauding red guards.1io The targets of theredguardswereleftvirtuallydefenseless.

TheRedGuardPicketCorpsGiven the attitude of Mao and the CCRG, any move against red guardviolence would have to be made by the students themselves.111 Some redguards in the downtown neighborhoods shared the views of the Qinghuastudents. On August 25 the Western District Picket Corps announced itsestablishment.This was thefirst formal cross-campus organization,analliance of fifty red guard groups from more than forty schools.Its mem-bers introduced themselves as “comrades in arms of the People's Libera-tion Army stationed in Beijing.”Among their responsibilities were to"resolutely assist red guard revolutionary activities” and “resolutely sup-press the counterrevolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants,counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists and their loyal de-scendants.”They declared that they“have the right toinspect red organ-izations in various schools,offices,factories,and units”and to“arrestfake red guards and hooligans."112 Among the organization's “Six Regu-lations” was the responsibility to study and implement the People's Lib-erationArmy's“ThreeRulesofDisciplineandEightPointsofAtten-tion,”which,they claimed,included the prohibition,“It is strictlyforbidden to beat and physically abuse people, it is strictly forbidden tohumiliate people."” Members were expected to “serve the people” and"gain their trust” and “under all circumstances remain cool headed andcalm."113TheHigh-SchoolRedGuards

151The Western District Picket Corps dictated a set of ground rules that itintended to enforce.It prohibited red guardsfrom invading the offices ofstate agencies and the homes of state officials and forbade them to ejectrevolutionary elders from their homes, fire their nannies, or confiscate theirtelevisions, sofas, and cars. Foreigners and overseas Chinese must not beharassed; searching the homes of "bad elements”must be done in coordi-nation with their work units and the local police, and anything confiscatedmust be turned over to public authorities. Force could be used only in self-defense.114 Only homes of “six black elements” could be searched, andonly after checking first with thelocalpolice to verify their classification.Itwas absolutely forbidden to search other homes; only nonviolent forms ofstrugglemustbeused.“Weredguards absolutelymustnot arbitrarilybeatpeople. When we use nonviolent forms of struggle, it proves that ourforces are incomparably strong."115The Western District Picket Corps was especially clear about violence."In theCulturalRevolutionfrom thispointforward itisabsolutelyfor-biddentobeatpeople,absolutelyforbidden tophysically abuse themeitheropenly or in a disguised manner; absolutelyforbidden tohumiliate people.absolutely forbidden to extract forced confessions"—a prohibition thatapplied“without exception,”even to people whohad already been deter-mined to be counterrevolutionaries.116 To avoid misunderstanding, theground rules providedexplicitdetailabout what constitutedphysicalabuse: “Kneeling, lying flat, bending at the waist, carrying a heavy weight.standing for long periods, keeping hands raised for long periods, keepingheads bowed for long period, etc., all are open or disguised forms of physical abuse and are not methods of struggle that we should use.” The for-bidden forms of humiliation included “hanging signboards [from theneck], wearing a tall hat, being made to sing chants, shaving heads, etc."What did the rules meanby“forced confessions"?“Failing to stress inves-tigation and research, failing to stress facts and evidence, readily believingconfessions, having blind faith in confessions, using a combination of vio-lence and threats to force a confession, and then believing the confes-sion."117 Counterpart organizations emerged in the Eastern and Haidiandistrictssoon afterward.118The picket corps soon found allies among the diminishing number ofcentral leaders who actively sought to rein in violence. Given the reluc-tanceofMaoandtheCCRGtohindermassmobilization,persuasionand voluntary self-restraint were the only politically acceptable courses.Premier Zhou Enlai worked actively behind the scenes to encourage152

ClassandViolenceself-policing. On August 24 he assigned Yong Wentao, vice-head of theCCP Propaganda Department, to handle liaison work with high-schoolred guards.119 On August 26 Yong established a liaison office at the Cul-tural Palace of Laboring Peoples,a complex of buildings in an enclosedpark behind the reviewing stands of Tiananmen. Late that evening ZhouEnlai spoke at the opening ceremonies.120 In the ensuing weeks Zhou andYong held a series of meetings with red guards to persuade them to cur-tail violence and exercise restraint. In the coming months Zhou attendedmore than forty meetings with high-school red guards organized by theliaison office, consistently arguing his case for moderation.121The liaison office was quickly swamped with visits,letters, and phonecalls.The contacts came from red guards seeking advice and clarifica-tion, and from citizens in the neighborhoods and leaders of schools andother government institutions who were under attack. During this periodthe main liaison office received up to 1,0oo visitors daily. In the firstmonth some 10,00ohigh-schoolstudents attended itsmeetings.Theliaisonofficealsoprovidedintelligenceaboutthesocialimpactofthemovement.The visits,phone calls,andletters were a rich source of informa-tion, and highlights were digested into a regular bulletin that was printedinternally and distributed to the Party Center, the State Council, and theCCRG. The bulletins detailed the mounting violence—by September 5the death toll had already passed the 1,0o0 mark—and supplemented thefigures with specific examples. Members of the CCRG were unhappyabout the emphasis on violence and expressed concerns about the liaisonoffice's“incorrect standpoint."122Unabletouseregularpoliceforces,ZhouEnlaiturnedtothepicketcorps as his primary instrument in this effort.When news of the WesternDistrict Picket Corps reached Zhou, he established a direct line of commu-nicationthroughtheOfficeoftheStateCouncil,headedbytheStateCoun-cil's secretary general, Zhou Rongxin. Xu Ming, on the staff of the StateCouncil office,handled contacts with the students.Her husband was KongYuan, Head of China's Central Intelligence Agency, and their son, KongDan, was a student at Beijing No. 4 High School and one of the foundersof the Western District Picket Corps.123 Zhou invited the group onto therostrum during subsequent red guard rallies at Tiananmen Square. He metwith its leaders and had Zhou Rongxin provide them with office space,means of transportation, and printing facilities.124Zhou Enlai dispatched the picket corps to defend government offices,high officials, and other prominent citizens.125 Under his instructions,TheHigh-SchoolRedGuards

153Zhou Rongxin and Xu Ming assigned the group's members a series oftasks: keeping order at train stations, acting as security guards at Tianan-men rallies,and rushing tohalt violent home invasions of famous artists,authors,orhistoricalfigures.Theyhandled sentry dutiesatinternationalconferences and at theBeijingHotel and other places whereforeignerswere received. They were dispatched to halt struggle sessions, housesearches,andbeatings.Eventuallytheyweresenttoministriestoprotectstate cadres and prevent student rebels from breaking into secure officesand opening confidential fles.126 Over the next two months the StateCouncil office reportedly provided the Western District Picket Corpswith two trucks, two jeeps, and a motorcycle, along with overcoats,shirts, army blankets, broadcasting equipment, sofas, stoves, telephones,an office, a kitchen with four cooks, and cash for expenses. Its generalorders were professionally printed in large runs at the State Council'sprintingplant.127

CollisionCourseIn the course of conducting these activities,theWestern District PicketCorps collided with university rebels who were demonstrating at na-tional ministries. This confrontation was not a product of the studentsfamily origins or political allegiances before the Cultural Revolution be-gan, nor was it even a product of different stances that they had takenunder theworkteams.Thehigh-schoolredguardsand theuniversitymi-norityfactionhadbothbeenin thevanguardof oppositionto theworkteams, and the leaders of both were from revolutionary households. Theminorityfactionattackedtheministriesnotbecauseofanyinherentdissatisfaction with the status quo,but because of their experiences underthe work teams and their subsequent rivalry with the majority faction ontheir campuses. The red guard pickets, formed by students initially lion-ized by Mao and the mass media, were not driven by intracampus rival-ries, and even if they were motivated to search for the leaders of theirworkteams,theywouldnotfindtheminnationalministries.The picket corps’“conservatism"—if it was that—was the product ofa relationship they developed with Zhou Enlai through his staff,a rela-tionshipforgedbytheirearlyvocalstandagainstpoliticalintoleranceandindiscriminateviolenceandbyZhou'sdesiretosteertheredguardmovement onto a less violent and disruptive path. Their dramatic con-frontations with college rebels at the Ministry of Geology,theMinistry

of Defense,and elsewhere in the city inadvertently crystallized a newtacit alliance with the university majority and drew them into a directconfrontation with their erstwhile sponsors on the CCRG.This con-frontation soon led to the first major turning point in the conflict be-tween red guards in the capital.RADICALSWITHPATRONS

TheRiseoftheRebelsIn earlySeptemberfactionalidentities at the citylevelwere still ill defined.On university campuses the majority-minority split was sharply drawn,but there was no coordinated action across campuses. Majority factionsinsisted that the work-team issue was settled and unimportant, and thispositionrequired little cross-campus coordination.Minority factions, onthe other hand,were adamant about the errors of the work teams andsought to dislodge their campus rivals by focusing on the issue. But only afew of them, like Geology East Is Red and Aeronautics Red Flag, haddramatized the issueby attacking central government offices.Factional identities in high schools had yet to form. The most influen-tial groups were from “red” households, especially the offspring of offi-cials. These early red guards, however, became embroiled in inconclusivedebates about the rhyming couplet that expressed a singularly chauvinis-tic interpretation of the party's class line. However lively and impassioned,these debates did not signify that red guards were divided by their familyorigins, because at this point virtually all red guard groups were domi-nated by students from “red,” especially “revolutionary,” origins. The is-sue of violence and discipline was much more consequential for cross-campus alliances.Thehigh-school movementhadbeenremarkablybrutal toward its victims, and this sharply divided the movement. Thiswas the issue that led to the first cross-campus alliance near the end ofAugust, the Western DistrictPicket Corps,which was soon followed bycompanion organizations in the Haidian and Eastern districts.The picketcorpsespousedaconceptionofdisciplinedpoliticalactionmodeledafterthe People's Liberation Army and appealed to the allegedly higher politi-cal morality of students from revolutionary family heritage.

underZhouEnlai,theysetouttopolicetheviolentandchaoticmovementthatengulfedthecity'sneighborhoods.Until earlySeptember the university and high-school movements pro-ceeded along separate tracks. This changed after a series of skirmishes be-tween high-school picket corps and the university minority factions thatbesieged national ministries. These skirmishes finally crystallized citywidefactional identities and clarified the still-unformed political strategy ofMao and the CCRG. The result, after another month, was a newly minted“rebel”faction built on the foundations of the old university minority.Therebels grew with behind-the-scenes encouragement and outspoken publicsupport of the CCRG, which publicly repudiated the old university major-ityandespeciallythehigh-schoolredguardswhohadbeenthemediastarsofAugust.

ConfrontationattheMinistriesThefirstconfrontation ataministryoccurredonAugust31,astheprotestby Aeronautics Red Flag at the Ministry of Defense entered its secondweek.This was the first major public action of theWesternDistrictPicketCorps, established six days earlier. Defending the ministry was naturallyattractiveto students whoidolized thetraditions ofthePeople'sLiberationArmy and viewed direct attacks on its headquarters as an affront to the in-stitution that symbolized the values for which the Cultural Revolution wasbeing waged. The Western District Picket Corps tried to forcibly dislodgethe protesters, but its small force was quickly repulsed.1On the next occasion it mobilized a much largerforce.Geology East IsRed sent several hundred members back to the GeologyMinistry on September5tostagea sit-intodramatizetheirdemand thattheir school'swork-team head, Vice-Minister Zou Jiayou, be turned over to them.HeChanggong, the ministry's party secretary and himself a revolutionarywarhero,hadbacked Zouinhis confrontationwith the studentsinJune.Now he refused to surrender him to the crowd. Instead, he requestedprotection fromhis superiors,who in turn notified the Western DistrictPicket Corps.² On September 7, the third day of the siege, more than 800members of the Western District Picket Corps surrounded the universitystudents. Theyloudly accused them of counterrevolution and waded intothe crowd, whipping the protesters with belts and throwing bricks. Theyseized several university students and held them prisoner for several days.Afterward they printed handbills denouncing attacks on the ministry.3 It

TheRiseof theRebelswas now clear that the red guards were hopelessly split. The minorityfactions had to contend not only with majority opponents on their owncampuses but also with a new militia of high-school students backed bytheStateCouncil.Mao had already expressed annoyance at expressions of concern aboutstudent violence, and members of the CCRG were uneasy about the re-ports submitted by Yong Wentao's Liaison Office. Now the picket corpspresented them with a large and unified cross-campus alliance that had noorganized rival in the city, espoused a coherent political vision that washighly attractive to the student militants Mao had recently praised, andwas proving capable of countering attacks on higher government officials.UnderMao'sdirection,theCCRGinitiatedaseriesofcountermovesthatreshapedandredirectedthestudentmovement.

CitywideAlliances:TheRedGuardHeadquartersIf the minority faction's insurgency was to succeed, it needed a cross-campus alliance and the clear backing of the CCRG.It had both by theend of September, and by mid-October it was routing its opponents. Itsalliance was called the RevolutionaryRebel Headquarters of the CapitalUniversityRed Guards,founded onSeptember 6 andknown as the ThirdHeadquarters. Initially composed of minority-faction red guards from six-teen campuses, it adopted a new identity as the “rebel" faction. Its guidingforce was Geology Institute East Is Red and one of its founders, ZhuChengzhao.*Zhuandhiscolleagueshadestablishedcontactwithtwomembers of the CCRG, Qi Benyu and Guan Feng, during their July visitto the Geology Institute to support their criticisms of the work team.5Later Li Na, the daughter of Mao and Jiang Qing, encouraged the groupandreportedregularlytoherfatheraboutpoliticaldevelopmentsintheschool.6During theSeptember siege at theMinistry of Geology,GuanFeng and other CCRG members were on the scene and provided quietencouragement.7Well before theminorityfaction set up theThirdHead-quarters,GeologyEastIsRedhaddirectcontactswiththeCCRGandindirect contactwithMao.As its name implies, the Third Headquarters was not the first attempttoform a citywide alliance.Thefirst was theCapitalUniversityRedGuard Headquarters, established on August 27.

Corps was founded and thebeginning of the Aeronautics Red Flagprotestat the Ministry of Defense, and four days after Geology East Is Red's firstprotest at the Ministry of Geology.Presiding at the founding meeting of the First Headquarters were anumber of national officials, including Jiang Qing, acting PLA chief ofstaff Yang Chengwu, and offcers from the Beijing Garrison Command.8The meeting at the Beijing Gymnasium was replete with military symbol-ism and claims that the“new red guards”were carrying on the glorioustraditions of the “old red guards”in the “revolutionary elder generation.""JiangQinglaid out avisionfor the student movement thatsoundedvery much like that of the Western District Picket Corps. She said thatYang Chengwu would serve as the “political instructor” for the redguards, and she gave them policing functions, reading out a list of govern-ment offices that they needed to protect.10The most prominent school leader at this meeting was Beida's NieYuanzi,wholed theschool'sredguardsintothisheadquarters andneverpubliclybrokefromit.NiestillbaskedinthegloryofherwallposterandMao's extravagant praise. She was secure in her position as the leader ofBeida, which was the only major campus without a majority-minoritysplit. Nie presided at a citywide First Headquarters meeting of red guardson September 1, where Zhou Enlai and Wang Renzhong gave speechescounseling moderation and nonviolence.11The First Headquarters articulated a conception of the red guard move-ment that was rapidly overtaken by events. The organization steadfastlyignored the majority-minority split and counseled unity and discipline.Through early October its newspaper mixed praise for the red guardswithadmonitionsforthemtoemulatethePLAandobserveits“threerules of discipline and eight points of attention." Its pages were filled withinstructions about arrangements for Tiananmen rallies, the reception ofred guards from the provinces, and international meetings with foreignstudents.12 The message was remarkably similar to that of the WesternDistrict Picket Corps and was certainly congenial to campus majoritiesthat were, like Nie herself, still securely in charge of their campuses. Byignoring the raging minority-majority conflict and blandly counselingunity and discipline, the First Headquarters became irrelevant to bothcampus factions,which simultaneously prepared their own breakawayheadquarters.Thefirst to strike was the Capital UniversityRed Guard General Head-quarters,orSecondHeadquarters,onSeptember5.Mostofthefounders

This stance would help defuse the work-teamissue and perhaps take the steam out of the minority faction's challengeon their home campuses. The Second Headquarters joined together dis-parate elements that were trying to steer a compromise course and reunitethe red guard movement. During early October its newspaper praised the“revolutionary minority” and criticized the errors of the work teams butstilldidnotdemandtherehabilitationoftheworkteams’victimsor thepursuit of the officials responsible.16The Third Headquarters was established on September 6, one dayaftertheSecondHeadquarters.Thefounderswereallminorityfactionsfrom sixteen different universities.17 Once again, Liu Zhijian gave thewelcoming speech, apologizing for the absence of Jiang Qing, who wasill, and Xie Fuzhi and Yang Chengwu,who had other meetings.Liu wel-comed thisheadquarters on an equal basis to the other two and gave aversion of the same speech he had given to the Second Headquarters theday before.18 In the coming weeks the Third Headquarters presented asharp contrast with the stances of the other two alliances. Its newspaperchronicled the persecutions inflicted by work teams on their opponentsand called them “white terror." It took great pains to document the factthat the vast majority of those persecuted by work teams were from"red" households and were members of the party and youth league.19Unliketheother two,theThirdHeadquarterspushedforaconfrontationwithananti-Maolineintheparty.One important component of this struggle was the refutation of TanLifu's now-famous speech, which had become a rallying cry for the uni-versitymajorityandthehigh-schoolpicketcorps.Thespeechwaswidely160

RadicalswithPatronsreproduced and distributed and wasfrequently quoted on the broadcastnetworks controlled by campus majorities. On September 13 Beijing Nor-mal Jingganggshan, the minority faction led by Tan Houlan, published anopen letter calling Tan Lifu's speech an “anti-Mao poisonous weed."Two days later, together with minority factions from eleven other schools,it established a cross-campus alliance to denounce Tan's speech, chargingthat it violated the party's verdict on the work teams and distorted theparty's class line. The group held a mass meeting at Beijing Normal onSeptember26.20

TippingtheScales:TheMaoistInterventionTheinitially evenhanded treatment accorded thethree red guard head-quarters gave no hint of the imminent shift in the political landscape.Mao and the CCRG were moving rapidly toward wholehearted endorse-ment of the minority factions, and this was signaled in meetings with redguards. On September 13,for example,Minister of Public Security XieFuzhi met with the minority faction from the Institute of Politics and Lawand said,“The general orientation of the minority faction is correct—notjust in the Institute of Politics and Law, but in other schools as well ..:The truth lies with the minority faction; I support the minority."21A crucial turning point was reached during meetings from September17 to September 20 between the CCRG and the leaders of some twentyprominent minority factions. Zhu Chengzhao of Geology East Is Redhelped organize the meeting and build the invitation list, which includedKuai Dafu of Qinghua, Tan Houlan of Beijing Normal, Wang Dabin ofthe Geology Institute, and other future red guard leaders of note. Thestudents told of the persecutions they had suffered at the hands of workteams and complained that they had still not been cleared of the chargeslodged against them. They criticized several top officials for not beingsympathetic to their cause: Zhou Enlai was a “compromiser,”as was TaoZhu. The students argued that there were now two clearly opposed linesoverthedirectionoftheCulturalRevolution,andtheCCRGshouldtakea clear stand. The proceedings of the meetings were relayed directly toMao and reinforced his growing dissatisfaction about the direction of thestudentmovement.22After the conferenceMao decided to openlyfavor the minority camp.On September 21,the day after the meetings concluded, Chen Boda,TheRiseoftheRebels

Satisfied that they had achieved their short-termobjective, they returned to the Geology Institute without work-team headZouJiayou.24Heartened by the support now extended to them by the CCRG, Geol-ogy East Is Red moved to seize power on campus on September 23.Amassive brawl over control of the campus broadcasting systemleft morethan 1o0 injured. Guan Feng and Qi Benyu went to the school to relay amessage from the CCRG: the skirmishes must be halted immediately,and the CCRG firmly supported East Is Red and its demand to bring ZouJiayou back to campus.25 Several days later Guan Feng and Qi Benyu metagain with students and sharply criticized Zou for calling in the WesternDistrict Picket Corps to attack the protesters and for refusing to return tothe school to apologize.26On September 25 Zhou Enlai finally met with the leaders of the ThirdHeadquarters and defended himself against criticisms of his calls formoderation: his speeches were approved by Chairman Mao, and even ifhehadcommittederrorsofline,that stilldidnotmakehim a counter-revolutionary. He was late in meeting with the Third Headquarters, buthe supported it as well.27 The news of CCRG support spread quickly.During the final week of September the minority factions at Qinghua, theAeronautics Institute, and Beijing Foreign Languages Institute all seizedcontrol of their campus broadcasting systems.28 The tide was now shiftingdecisively.In light of his reputation as a compromiser, it was significant thatZhou Enlai himself delivered the definitive speech that made clearMao'ssupportfor theminorityfaction.OnSeptember 26 Zhou addressed amassrally of the ThirdHeadquartersand statedcategorically that the162

He announced that all "black ma-terials”collected on these individuals would be removed from their files,andthathenceforthallmembersoftheminorityfactionwouldbetreatedas the equals of other red guards.29 Zhou may well havehoped that satis-fying this demand would take the urgency out of the minority faction'scauseandremovetheprimaryincentiveforrebelattacksonthemin-istries. To make sure that this message was not lost, Zhou followed up hispublic promise with detailed instructions about how to return or destroymaterials in the files so that no incriminating materials would remain.30This became official policy on November 15 when the Beijing MunicipalParty Committee issued a notice declaring all political labels given to thestudent opposition null and void and the Central Committee followed suitby ordering all materials related to these judgments removed from theparty'sfilesand destroyed.31This shift in the CCRG's stance was already apparent to many in themajority coalition. Tan Lifu, who had inadvertently become a majorityspokesman,immediately recognized the shifting winds when the ThirdHeadquarters was established onSeptember 6.His minority-faction opponent, Industrial University East Is Red, was among its founding members.That same evening Tan announced that he was disbanding his revolu-tionary committee and turning it into a “logistics department" for theschool's many red guard organizations. Three weeks later Tan and hiscomradesmadefinalspeechestotheirIndustrialUniversityRedGuards.who had lost control of the campus and were being disbanded. Tan ac-cepted the responsibility for their failure: his emphasis on the class back-ground of students from exploiting classes was “left”in form but rightistin essence and served to divide the masses.32 In a proclamation on Octo-ber 1, Tan announced to the entire school that he had already resignedfrom all red guard posts because of the errors he had committed, includ-inghisfamousspeech.Althoughheinsistedthathismotivationswerehonest, he admitted to virtually every error of orientation and line thatthe school's minority faction had charged for the past six weeks.How-ever,hestilldeniedthathisgroupandtheworkteamwerecounterrevo-lutionary. Tan then withdrew from red guard politics, left the school tothe minority faction, and departed for a tour of the south.33ThefallofTanLifucoincidedwiththeriseofKuaiDafu,whosoonTheRiseoftheRebels

He encouraged Kuai tostart his own organization and assured him of CCRG support. The nextdayKuai announced the establishment of a separate new minority orga-nization, Qinghua Jinggangshan, and he and his group began a rapid ascenttothetopoftherebelmovement.35Kuai was a shrewd choice tolead the Qinghua rebels.The otherQinghua minority leaders had opposed the work team and had sympa-thizedwithKuai'sstand,butKuaihadshownthathewasfearlessanddefiant, and he had ready-made grievances against high officials who were inthe CCRG's crosshairs for future purges.

Kuai appeared to blame his vic-timization by the work team onWang Guangmei's influence,and theCCRG apparently calculated that this would make Kuai highly amenableto attacks onWang and on Liu Shaoqihimself.He in fact issued his firstdemand to return Wang Guangmei to campus for self-criticism on October9 and dramatized his demand with a march downtown for a sit-in.36Less than twoweeks afterestablishinghisnewrebelgroup,Kuaiwasse-lected to play a key role at a massive Third Headquarters rally on October6 at Beijing Workers’ Stadium. The meeting was virtually an officialCCRG function, with Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Jiang Qing, and ZhangChunqiao all present and addressing the crowd.37 Kuai led the assembledstudents in swearing an oath of loyalty. On this day Kuai Dafu became theface of the incipient rebel movement, and his rapid ascent was assured.38164

TheCollapseoftheMajorityCoalitionThe decisive shift toward support for the Third Headquarters was ex-pressed in an authoritativeRedFlagcommentary that appeared after in-tensive last-minute revisions supervised by Mao.39 This famous editoriallaidoutanewdefinitionoftheimmediateaimsoftheCulturalRevolu-tion and pronounced a new verdict on the events thathad transpired dur-ing the previous four months. The work teams’errors were part of a"bourgeois reactionary line” that was manipulated from above by offi-cials who opposed Mao and tried to obstruct the Cultural Revolution."The two-line struggle has by no means concluded,” the editorial in-toned, and it followed that there were even higher officials in the state hi-erarchy who had masterminded the conspiracy.40To ensure that officials nationwide understood the new line,Mao con-venedaCentralPartyWorkConferencefromOctober9to28.Oneofthe highlights of the conference was a report by Chen Boda—revised re-peatedlybyMaobeforehand—that summarized the pasttwomonths.Chen described an ongoing “two-line struggle” regarding the CulturalRevolution, and efforts on the part of both officials and red guards toblunt its impact and divert its course. Refuting arguments against redguard violence of the kind made in the “Urgent Appeals” and the direc-tives of the Western District Picket Corps, he denied that red guards wereacting “recklessly” and that among them were “opportunists joining upwith careerists, thugs, brutal savages, and the like to assume the role ofCultural Revolution ‘activists.'" Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping duti-fully made self-criticisms about their“errors of line”regarding the workteams.41Onepartoftheoffensiveagainstthe“bourgeoisreactionaryline”wasacampaign against its student spokesman, Tan Lifu. Tan would not be per-mitted to quietly step down from the stage. His arguments had proven pop-ular, so Mao and the CCRG began a nationwide campaign to clarify the“reactionary” nature of his speech.During October Tan was denounced byalongseriesofhighpartyofficialsatredguardralliesandmeetings:XieFuzhi, Yang Chengwu, Zhang Chunqiao, Yong Wentao, Zhou Enlai, QiBenyu, Jiang Qing, Wang Li, Tao Zhu, Guan Feng, and others.42 He hadbecome a poster boy for the bourgeois reactionary line.Chen Boda's keynote speech on October 16 began a campaign of vilifi-cationthatwouldtieTantotheintensifyingefforttocondemnLiuShaoqiChensaid,

There are also those who are not so good, or who are very bad, tothe point of taking the roadof revisionism...Whymust aperson wieldpower simply because they are the child of a high cadre?Because Tan had defended the party's class line, Chen commented on thisas well:“In our revolutionaryranks,ChairmanMaoandourpartyhavealways given special emphasis to class status and class origin.At the sametime, they have also opposed^class status only'... To fail to emphasizeclass status and class origin is very mistaken. Sole emphasis on class ori-gin,andnotemphasizingpoliticalperformance,isalsoverymistaken.These mistaken viewpoints must be criticized."43 In fact, this was exactlythe position on the class line taken by Tan Lifu in his speech, but that wasbeside the point. Tan had used these arguments to defend his school's workteam and had expressed powerful arguments against the minority's posi-tion, and by extension against the current stance of the CCRG. Moreover,Tan's defense of the party's class line had been appropriated as a rallyingcry by the picket corps in their appeal to “five-red brothers” to disciplinetheirviolent excesses.44As the campaign against him unfolded, Tan was still traveling in thesouth.InmeetingswithredguardsinearlyOctober,XieFuzhi andChenBoda suggested that Tan be escorted back to Beijing for mass criticism.45A delegationfromIndustrial UniversityEast Is Red intercepted him onNovember 2 in Chongqing and urged him to return to campus to debateviewpoints expressed in his departing “Proclamation” to the school.46

Its newspaper gave a detailed explanation ofthe internal debates that had made the power seizure necessary and de-nounced the stance of the majority organizations that formerly had domi-nated the Second Headquarters.53Having ignored the majority-minority split in the first place, the FirstHeadquarters, whose most prominent member was Beida's Nie Yuanzisurvived without any apparent internal turmoil. The organization smoothlyaltered the contents of its newspaper to mimic the shifting Maoist line. TheSeptember 28issue contained its standard fare of praise for the red guardsand calls for military discipline. The publication of the Red Flag editorialdenouncing the bourgeois reactionary line led to rapid backpedaling, and

TheRiseoftheRebelsthe October 5 issue contained only two innocuous articles on one page.The next issue carried the usual four pages, now with full-throated denun-ciations of the bourgeois reactionary line.54 All three red guard headquar-ters coexisted, espousing the same political message, until they merged inFebruary1967.The Western District Picket Corps and its counterparts, which hadbeen established with such fanfare at the end of August and which for afew weeks had played such a prominent role in the capital, also fell intodisarray.Now that their stance was clearly repudiated by the CCRG,theactivesupportthattheyreceivedfromtheStateCouncilofficecouldnolonger be maintained.Their leaders were similarly demoralized and bymid-October were asking their former patrons in the Red Guard LiaisonOffice whether it made sense for them to continue.The picket corpsceased to exist as a coordinated citywide organization, but campus-levelgroups maintained their cohesion and identity for many weeks to come.The most committed among them later mounted a spirited last-ditch ef-fort to resist the new turn in the movement,an effort that led to a daringandill-fatedconfrontationwiththeCCRG.

TheRebelSurgeIn the wake of Zhou Enlai's September 26 speech to the Third Head-quarters and the triumphant mass rally on October 6, CCRG membersQi Benyu and Guan Feng, and staff member Lin Jie, fanned out to univer-sity campuses to explain the new political line to students on both sides.55Buoyedbytheobvioussupportfortheirposition,therebelforcessurgedinto control of their campuses and expanded their assaults on centralstate organs.Aeronautics Red Flag seized its campus broadcasting sta-tion on October 4, and the next day work-team head Zhao Ruzhang fi-nally went to the school to apologize.56 The Agricultural Machinery Insti-tute's minority organization, East Is Red, took over its school broadcastingstation on October 8 and immediately began a campaign against its bu-reaucratic superiors in the Eighth Ministry of Machine Building.57 OnOctober10 the minority factions at thePetroleum andBroadcasting insti-tutes carried out similar actions.58Majority control of university campusescollapsed.As minority factions took control, they focused their fire on the al-leged authors of the “bourgeois reactionary line” in the agencies that hadsent out theirworkteams.GeologyEastIsRedmadeits third andfinal

On October 9 AgriculturalMachinery Institute East Is Red invaded the Eighth Ministry of MachineBuilding and subjected the minister to “four and a half hours of lively de-bate.” In the end he was forced to sign an agreement to turn over the in-stitute's work-team head to the students for hard labor on campus, alongwith all the members of the work team and the negative materials col-lected on students.61 On October 10 the Red Flag Brigade of Beijing For-eign Languages Institute invaded the Foreign Ministry and proceeded toransack its archives in search of “black materials”collected on opponentsof the work team.62 During the same period two rebel organizationsfrom the Institute of Politics and Law marched to the Supreme People'sCourt,where the head of the institute's work team was a bureau chief.They forced the court's top official to announce that he was stripping thework team's head of all his posts, and the students gathered all the mem-bers of the work team together for a criticism session where they de-nounced theworkteam's leader.63The targets of rebel attacks were highly predictable: the rebels wentdirectly up the bureaucratic hierarchy to the organs that sent work teamsto their schools. The pattern of attacks traced the administrative hierar-chy:theForestryInstitutetotheForestryMinistry;theGeologyInstituteto the Geology Ministry; the Aeronautics Institute to the National DefenseScientific and Technology Commission; and so forth.64 There was no pointin crossing the lines of administrative authority; students from the GeologyInstitute had nogrievances to address at the Forestry Ministry.In thissense, the rebel movement ran through channels defined by the nationaladministrativehierarchy.Onlyafterstudentshadmettheirobjectivesattheadministrativeleveljust above their school did they move to higher levels.

RunningtheMovementThe CCRG's extensive contacts with the minority faction and its publicsupport for that faction's cause dovetailed perfectly with Mao's tacticalagenda of extending purges upward into the top reaches of the state ap-paratus. In the course of steering the student movement, the CCRG es-tablished strong ties with campus leaders at the major universities. Theseindividuals served as the primary means for the CCRG to steer and shapeevents, and the CCRG continued to rely on them until the demise of thered guards in July 1968.The CCRG was running a mass movement tosubvert the established order in ways reminiscent of the undergroundcommunistmovementinareascontrolledbytheNationalistsbefore1949. The level of secrecy and risk was much lower, but the central con-ception of covertly steering a mass movement to challenge authorities inways that furthered one's own somewhat different political agenda waslargelythesame.TheCCRGmaintainedintensivecontactswithcampusleadersthroughout the Cultural Revolution.Reporters from the PLA and the New ChinaNews Agency were stationed on campuses, reported regularly on studentpolitics, and established close relationships with key leaders who willinglyused them as channels to communicate with the upper levels. The head-quarters for these activities was the CCRG offices at the Diaoyutai State170

Soon after being designated Qinghua's primary rebel leaderby the CCRG,for example,Kuai Dafu traveled around the city in a gov-ernment car and had a female secretary with him at all times. Membersvisited campuses and attended rallies to make speeches and instruct stu-dent leaders and activists. Liaison personnel relayed CCRG instructionsto favored student leaders, issued outright orders, and if necessary,backed them up with threats.70 Throughout the movement student lead-erslookedtotheseencountersforvalidationoftheircourseofactionandguidance about what to do next.The CCRG came to rely most heavily on five leaders who provedamenable to their direction from the outset. They established ties withthese figures by October 1966 and maintained them until the movementwas forcibly disbanded in 1968. The course and outcome of the movementultimately depended on the relationships between these leaders and mem-bers of the CCRG, and especially on their relationships with one another.As we shall see in subsequent chapters,these relationships were oftenfrayed, and the red guards became a source of deep frustration for theCCRG after they fell into mutual conflicts. In the fall of 1966, however,these five leaders were instrumental in turning the tide of the movement inthe direction ordained by the campaign against the “bourgeois reactionaryline."The first of these leaders was something of an anomaly because shewas very different by temperament, position, and experience from all theothers. Nie Yuanzi, in fact, was not a student at all and had never evenattended college. She was forty-five years old, thrice-married, and amiddle-ranking party offcial—a Yan'an-era veteran with relatives and ahusband in high party positions. Moreover, she and her Beida dissidentshad been part of the school's work team, and she had never led or orga-nized an insurgent movement to achieve control of her school. Nie's only

These two organi-zations distinguished themselvesbybeing thefirst tolead largeprotestsat organs of state power. Their political stance was eventually adopted asthe core of the subsequent campaign against the“bourgeois reactionaryline." The Geology Institute's leaders were instrumental in forming theThirdHeadquarters,and theAeronauticsInstitutetookover theSecondHeadquarters and aligned it with the Third.Han Aijing, the twenty-two-year-old son of a revolutionary martyr, emerged as the top leader at theAeronautics Institute. Zhu Chengzhao,the twenty-five-year-old“cadretransfer student” and son of a bureau-level official, was groomed for thisrole at the Geology Institute. Zhu led the attacks on the Geology Ministryand was the driving force behind the establishment of the Third Head-quarters.172

TheBureaucraticStructureofRebellionWhen Mao and the CCRG encouraged students to repudiate the “bour-geois reactionary line,” they were in fact spurring them to attack directlyup thelines of the national bureaucratichierarchy.The subsequent rebelinsurgency followed a distinctive bureaucratic pattern.Because the workteamsweresentdowntouniversitiesandinstitutesfrom their supervisory agencies in the bureaucratic system, red guards who were aggrievedafter clasheswithworkteamsfollowedtheselines of authorityupwardwhen they sought redress.Their motiveshad nothing to dowith their in-herent stance toward the status quo or with their prior positions in it.The“rebel”factions wereinitiallymotivated toattackministriesinorderto remove the possible stigma of political labels in their permanent rec-ords, and in so doing to dislodge from power the indifferent or hostilemajority factions that controlled their campuses.Once they discoveredpowerful patrons on the CCRG, they willingly pursued further attacksonnationalauthoritiesevenaftertheirinitialdemandsweremet.The decision to use the aggrieved minority factions to renew a stalledoffensive on the national leadership does not appear to have been a pre-ordained plan.For almost a month the CCRG tried to get the students toput their differences aside. The strong grievances harbored by the minor-ity factions at the Aeronautics and Geology institutes, which had experi-enced major confrontations with the work teams, provided them withanother opportunity. The daring tactical innovation of these two factions(undertaken with behind-the-scenes encouragement of the CCRG) finallytook the protests to the centers of national power. This political maneu-ver turned the tide against the dominant majority faction and the high-schoolpickets and redirected the student movement against nominallypowerfulbut largely defenseless bureaucrats.Notably absentfrom these autumnforays werefactions from thelargenational-leveluniversitiesunder theMinistry ofHigherEducation—BeidaQinghua,andBeijingNormal—whoseworkteamshadbeendrawnfroma collection of national agencies. Beida's work team had already been re-pudiatedanddisgracedinthemostpublicanddecisivefashion,inrepeatedon-campus struggle sessions overseenbyCCRGofficials.Thehead of theBeijing Normal work team was removed from power and repudiated evenbefore the other work teams were withdrawn, and Kang Sheng himselfdenounced him on the campus.

TheRiseoftheRebelsremoved much of the motivation of aggrieved students at these schools toprotest their victimization. But even if they had still had a strong motive,they would have had to pursue the members of their work teams to a num-ber of different commissions and ministries. The specialized ministry-runinstitutes,by contrast, had work teams composed entirely of personnelfrom one agency and directly supervised by it. Not until much later in theinsurgency did a figure like Kuai Dafu pursue attacks on higher-level offi-cialslikeBoYiboandWangGuangmei.These considerations provide further evidence that the motives of therebel faction were rooted in specific political interactions during Juneand July, not in any lack of vested interests in the status quo. They werefighting, instead, to avoid losing what had once been a favored positionand a secure future—and against the injustice that had been done tothem.A movement that superficiallylooked chaotic and disorganized infact developed according to a predictable bureaucratic logic. Indeed, theway in which the student movement was “run” and goaded into attacksup the lines of authority suggests that the red guard movement was not amassmovement as conventionallyunderstood,butaform ofmasspar-ticipationinbureaucraticpolitics.DISSENTANDITSSUPPRESSION

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteThe rise and fall of red guardfactionsreflected their modular organization.Even within a single university, a red guard “faction”was not a sin-gle, unified organization but a collection of allied small groups, largelybased on classrooms or academic departments, each with its own name,identity, and leaders.University-level factions were large coalitions ofsmaller units, all collected under a single banner and a collective leadershipstructure that represented the more dominant “fighting groups."1 At Bei-jing University in mid-October 1966, there were reportedly 92 fightinggroups claiming a total of around 3,0o0 members.At that time they weregrouped into three large alliances.2 Over the two-year course of the move-ment at Beida, the two factional newspapers published articles authored by358 different fighting groups, most of which had names that linked themto specificdepartments and classrooms.A similar examination of thefac-tional newspapers at Chinese People's University yielded a total of 196 sep-aratefightinggroups.3The basic building block of the red guard movement was a small groupofstudents,usuallynomorethantentofifteenindividualsfromthesameclassroom, who pledged allegiance to broader factional groupings as theyformed within a school.Factional coalitions grew or shrank as thesesmall fighting groups were founded, disbanded, or renamed, and as theyshifted their allegiance from one factional federation to another. Thestrength of afactionalfederation depended onits ability tomobilize smallgroups to write wall posters to support its position, attend rallies and meet-ings,orparticipateinprotestevents.Although the vast majority of students who took part in the movementconformedtowhateverlineseemedtobesanctionedbyMaoandthe

The cellular struc-ture had another consequence: even after the seeming defeat of a large fac-tional alliance, small fighting groups could maintain vocal pockets of resis-tance, going against the tide long after the alliance's larger cause seemed tobe lost.Although the university majority was defeated, some of its propo-nents persevered, largely through campus speeches and wall posters. Andalthough the Western District Picket Corps and its counterparts ceased tooperate by late October,many of their constituentfightinggroups contin-ued to articulate an independent point of view, and some even banded to-getherin alast-ditcheffort to turn thetide.Some of therebelleaders intheThird Headquarters themselves began to have second thoughts about theCCRG's manipulation of the student movement and to express doubts oftheirown.These dissidents neverrepresenteda serious challenge to the rebelsbut they developed a daring and coherent critique of the CCRG that re-flected a rare independence of mind. In wall-poster campaigns and anabortive effort to coordinate cross-campus resistance, the rebellious dissi-dents mounted a bold challenge—not to defenseless bureaucrats on theapproved list of victims, but to CCRG officials who were manipulatingthe student movement toward their political ends. This small campaignbrieflyrattled therebelfaction and angered membersof the CCRG.Aloneamong students at this point in Chinese history, these dissidents had a re-alistic view of what was actually taking place, while the “rebels” wereconformingtoCCRGauthorityandwrappingtheiractionsinafantasylanguageofconspiracyandrebellion.Themembers of theCCRGwelcomed criticism ofofficials that theywantedremovedbutreactedwithharshintolerancetowardcriticismdirectedatthemselves.ThedissidentsofNovemberandDecemberwerefirmly suppressed, and their campaign was the last echo of the factionaldivide that split the student movement in 1966.

Dissent andItsSuppression

ChallengingtheRadicalBureaucratsThe challenge to the CCRG began tentatively in mid-November and cli-maxedduringthefirsttwoweeksofDecember.Itboreastrikingresem-blance to the complaints by the minority faction about its memberstreatmentbyworkteamsseveralmonthsbefore.Thedissidentsresentedtheway theywere shunted aside andvilified by theCCRGin October.We have already seen that the students who supported work teams sawthemselves as rebels in every sense of the word—and in the majority ofschoolswithradicalworkteamsthereislittlereasontodoubtthisper-ception. In retrospect they accepted that they had erred in supportingtheirworkteamsevenTanLifuacknowledgedthisasearlyasSeptem-ber. But they refused to accept accusations that they were “conservatives”or“revisionist red guards”whosupportedthe“bourgeois reactionaryline."The complaints gradually escalated in an interactive process that resem-bledtheconflictbetweentheworkteams andtheiropponentstheprevioussummer.ThefirstwallposterscomplainingaboutunfairtreatmentbytheCCRGweredenouncedas attacksonthe“proletarianheadquarters”andattemptsat“capitalistrestoration.”Thisescalatedthedisputetoamatterof principle: whether the CCRG was exempt from criticism, and whether ithad the right to suppress a genuine mass movement sanctioned by Chair-man Mao and protected by the provisions of the “Sixteen Points.” As theattacks on thecritics continued,thedissidents turnedthetables ontheCCRG and accused it of pursuing the very “bourgeois reactionary line"that it pretended to denounce. The dissidents asked why the work teamswere forbidden to denounce and label student rebels who criticized them,but the bureaucrats on the CCRG were able to claim that they alone wereimmune from criticism and could manipulate and suppress students how-ever they pleased. The stronger the parallels between the behavior of theCCRGandthatofthereviledworkteams,themorethedissidentsesca-lated their critiques to the point where they openly accused the CCRG ofunprincipled factional designs that ultimately opposed the Cultural Revo-lutionandChairmanMao.Thesewereincendiaryaccusations,andthemovementwascrushedshortlyaftertheyweremade.These arguments were highly congenial to former members of the uni-versitymajority and thehigh-schoolrebels associated with the picket corps.However, they were voiced by only a small number of daring individualsand fighting groups. Their wall posters and speeches were reprinted and

177

ChallengingtheMaoistElitedenounced by opposing red guards throughout the city in a manner similarto theearlier attacks onTanLifu.Itisthrough thesedenunciationmateri-als that we have a record of their ill-fated campaign.The first public questioning of the CCRG arose in mid-October. It originated in a school that did not figure prominently in the later dissidentcampaign. Issued by the Maoism Red Guards of the Beijing BroadcastingInstitute—a fighting group associated with the school's “majority'faction—the wall poster was focused almost exclusively on the school'sfactional conflict. This group's challenge presaged the later campaign intwo senses:it charged that the CCRG's interventions in its school violatedthe“"Sixteen Points,”and it demanded that members of the CCRG returnto theschoolforcriticism.4TheCCRGhadintervenedin theBroadcastingInstitute'spoliticsonJuly24whenseveralofitsmembersaccompaniedKangShengtotheschool to denounce the work team and “liberate” its opponents.5 Whatbothered the students whohad supported this radical work team was notthe“liberation”ofthestudentswhohadopposeditbutthewaytheywere shunted aside and ignored by the CCRG.Three days after the dra-maticeventsofJuly24,theCCRGsentGuanFengandYaoWenyuantothe school toform a temporary CulturalRevolution committee.Guanand Yao consulted only with the work team's victims, ignored the stu-dents whohad avoided conflicts with the work team,and unilaterally se-lected a committee composed solely of members of the minority faction.The criticsexplained that thisviolated the“SixteenPoints,”which wasissuedtwoweekslater,inearlyAugust.This sequence of events bred a minority-majority conflict that initiallytook an unusual form: a “minority” faction that defended its poweragainst an excluded “majority” faction, rather than the other way around.The majority faction overthrew the minority's “temporary committee"during September, but after the CCRG openly favored the Third Head-quarters, the ousted minority faction pressed its claim, accusing the ma-jority of “violating CCRG directives.” In response, the school's majorityfaction challenged the CCRG's initialintervention in its school.It orga-nized a petition drive and collected 6o0 signatures demanding the returnof the CCRG to the school for self-criticism: “The CCRG's handling oftheviews of themajorityfactionhasbeen crude,bureaucratic,based oncoercionrather than persuasion."The wall poster blamed factional divi-sions in the school on the CCRG,which maneuvered to put the minorityfactionin power.“The creation of the temporary CR committee itself is a

violationoftheSixteenPointsandisamanifestationoftheinfluenceofthe bourgeois reactionary line."This earlychallenge is significantbecause it presagedtwomajorthemes of the subsequent dissident campaign:it accused the CCRG of re-peating the errors of the work team by implementing a “bourgeois reac-tionary line” that suppressed the masses and labeled opponents, and itclaimed the right to criticize any leader who violated the “Sixteen Points."Like the subsequent dissidents, the challengers from the Broadcasting In-stitutebuttressed their claims by quotingRedFlag editorials and policiesearlier championed by the CCRG itself.

TheDissidentCampaignintheUniversitiesThe dissident campaign began in mid-November, and its most influentialauthors were at theBeijing Aeronautics Institute.In a series of outspokenand influential wall posters, two fighting groups originally associatedwith the institute's majority red guards developed a sophisticated critiqueof the CCRG.The opening salvo charged the CCRG with behaving inways associated with the work teams’“bourgeois reactionary line."”Thecore grievance was that the majority faction was never treated as equally“revolutionary."”This slight must have been felt with particular acuity atthe Aeronautics Institute, where the work team, after initial hesitation,pursued a radical attack on the school's power structure.In its first two wall posters the Aeronautics Red Guards complainedthat the CCRG talked only to the opposing Red Flag faction and ignoreddiffering points of view.It likened the CCRG to big-shot bureaucratswho did not investigate for themselves but simply rode around issuingorders. Drawing parallels between its current situation and the sufferingof the minority faction under the work teams, it claimed that its memberswere denounced as“rightists” and “conservatives,”while their earlier pi-oneering contributions were ignored.This,the students claimed,was a"new bourgeois reactionary line.” What did the majority faction do tomerit thelabel“conservative”and bebrushed aside so thoughtlessly?Mil-itant students whomistakenlyfollowed thework teamwiththebestofin-tentions should not be reviled as conservatives.The intimidation of theformer majority faction repeated what had happened under the workteams.6After the minorityfaction lashed back at these arguments with a seriesof accusations, the dispute escalated to a matter of principle: was the

179

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteCCRG beyond criticism?Members of the minority faction complainedthat their first wall posters were met with accusations and epithets:“bas-tards,” “sons of bitches,” “small die-hard group of conservatives,” “youare bombarding the proletarian headquarters,” and “whoever attacks theCCRG,we will smash his dog head.”The red guards continued,“It seemsas if those who constantly say they want to criticize the bourgeois reac-tionary line still have not recognized what was reactionary about it ..:The likes of Guan Feng and Qi Benyu, full of bureaucratic airs, simplycannotrepresentChairmanMao."The criticisms became more pointed and personal, and the dissidentsdirected their anger at Guan Feng and Qi Benyu, the two members of theCCRGwhohadbeenstationedattheAeronauticsInstitutetotransferpower to the minority faction, Red Flag.These people see the chance to use others to attack headquarters throughoutthe country, ransack the homes of the masses, seize confidential files, and beatpeople,eventothepointof attacking theMilitaryAffairs Commission andZhongnanhai ...These are all the CCRG's responsibility. Moreover, QiBenyu arbitrarilycensures someoftheredguardsfor notkneelingdownbe-fore theThirdHeadquarters.Does this mean that whichfaction isleftistis determinedbywhateverfallsfromthelipsofthisQiBenyu?The red guards intensified their critique of the CCRG by accusing it ofa conspiratorial and bureaucratic style of work that in fact repudiatedthemassnatureof themovement:Certain comrades on the CCRG...through means of factional connec-tions, leak the new policy line to certain people who then criticize others . . .How can you possibly resolve problems of unity created by the bourgeoisreactionaryline by scheming touse this same mistakenline?...Peoplewhoactlike tigerswhosebacksideyoudarenot touch are certainlynotleftists.When the masses strongly air their objections,the CCRG instantly decidesthis will not do, starts plotting behind the scenes, secretly criticizes andissuesdirectives.7BythesecondweekofDecembertheAeronauticsInstitutedissidentsbecame more aggressive. They parried the abuse hurled at them andquoted from Red Flag editorials and speeches by Lin Biao that the essenceof the Cultural Revolution was to oppose incorrect leadership that wasnot in accord with Mao Thought, no matter who that official might be.8180

DissentandItsSuppressionBy far the most incendiary wall poster was one on December 12 that ac-cused the CCRG ofposing as leftists in order to engineer apalace coup:Thespecialfeatureofclassstruggletodayisbetweenthebourgeoisie's“peaceful evolution” and the proletariat's struggle against“peaceful evolu-tion,”between the class enemies’“palace coup”and our struggle to suppress“palace coups.” Today, the special feature of the class enemy is that they"hang up a sheep's head but sell dog meat, wave the red flag to oppose the redflag”...We ask the CCRG,doyou intend to uphold the guiding ideology oftheproletariat...Or doyouinsistonsectarianfactionalpolitics under theguidance of petty bourgeois ideology? ... “Doubt everything” (in reality, re-pudiate everything）is the guiding ideology of the petty bourgeoisie.“Allpower to the leftists"(the majority are without power?) is the arrogant, con-ceited, self-important, and selfish ideology of the petty bourgeoisie. “LongLive the Red Terror” (aimed at the masses, not at the landlords and capitalists,as in the earlier stage)is the narrow-minded doctrine ofrevenge taking of thepetty bourgeoisie and is precisely the “spirit of revolutionary rebellion” so ad-miredbycertaincomradesontheCCRG.9The Forestry Institute was another dissident stronghold. The primaryfigurewasLiHongshan,formerleaderoftheinstitute'sredguards.InearlyNovember Li and othersformed theRed GuardDare-to-DieCorpsand held meetings with like-minded students from Qinghua and othernearby campuses.10 On November 30 Li and one of his comrades put upa large banner at the Forestry Institute: “Kick Aside the CCRG andMake Revolution on Your Own.” This slogan explicitly echoed the fre-quent demand to “kick aside the work team” made by minority factionsin their earlier struggles. The next day Li's group explained its position:"In our view there is a phenomenon in the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution at present that is not very good: no matter what the issue is, itis essential to seek out the CCRG. Central leaders’speeches are reprintedin large volume, sometimes with large discrepancies. Many people haveseveral volumes consisting solely of Central leaders’ speeches, and readthem all day long. This is no way to truly use Mao Zedong Thought inguiding the CulturalRevolution."The authors argued that the CCRGshould step back from the movement and“respect the masses’creativespirit."11This presentation was restrained compared with the oral arguments Lihad made on campus the day before, when he had defended his positioninmorevehementterms.Li arguedthattheCCRGhadnoconstitutional

181

ChallengingtheMaoistElitestanding; no one had ever stated that it would be exempt from criticism;and because the CCRGhad not been elected according toParis Com-mune principles,it violated the “Sixteen Points”and the spirit of MaoThought.In fact,he argued,“Members of the CCRG just sit at the upperlevels,acting like bureaucrats and overlords,not coming down below,not investigating, always sitting in Beijing, not going out to the provinces."Li pointed out that red guards in other cities were making revolution with-out interference from local CCRGs, so why should the movement in Bei-jingbe saddled with one?“Members of the CCRG fly about like imperialenvoys, spewing all kinds of verbiage, making all kinds of confused state-ments. Leaders’ speeches are cherished like life itself, treated like precioustreasures.There are alreadyeightvolumes of them...China canbeledonly by Chairman Mao.Anything else you can doubt, doubt everything.The speeches of Premier Zhou, Jiang Qing, Chen Boda, and others allmust be analyzed in terms of the supreme directives. You can doubt any-thing."Finally, he complained, Chen Boda labeled the majority faction “revi-sionistredguards,”andhis speech(totheOctoberPartyWorkConfer-ence)wasreprintedasapamphletandcirculatednationwide.They turned the spearhead of struggle against the masses, at Tan Lifu. ChenBoda said Tan Lifu's speech was a big poisonous weed. I say it was a revolu-tionary speech,basicallyin accordwith the spirit ofMaoZedongThought..Tan Lifu is an ordinary college student, the son of a revolutionary, a provi-sional party member,and thehead of theBeijingIndustrialUniversityRedGuards...After the editorialinRedFlag no.13,inevery organization,everyschool,if they werenot criticizingTanLifu's speech,then theywere not criti-cizing thebourgeois reactionaryline.All schoolswerethe same—thiswas anorganized, planned effort to turn the spearhead of struggle against themasses...At present the CCRG is a stumblingblock at the feet of ChairmanMao,a stumblingblockintheway of the CulturalRevolution...How canwenot kick aside thiskind of CCRG?12This brazen challenge enraged the Forestry Institute's rebel faction, EastIsRed,whichattackedandransacked theoffice andbroadcastingstationof Li's group the very same day. As was the case with other dissidents, thisattempt to intimidate only led Li Hongshan to dig in his heels and inten-sify his criticisms. On December 2 his associates put up a wall poster atTiananmen charging that the CCRG was carrying out “the bourgeois reac-tionary line."13 The argument was essentially the same as that made by182

Dissent andItsSuppressiondissidentsattheAeronauticsInstitute:theCCRGwasrepeatingtheerrorsof the work teams and represented the resurgence of the bourgeois reac-tionaryline.14Li'sgrouplaterheapedscornonChenBoda'sbrazen attackonanordi-nary student,TanLifu,and hiswillfuldistortionof the content of TanLifu's speech.Tan had not invented the high-school “couplet” that startedthe debate, nor had he defended the way it was stated.He had simply de-fended the basic principles of the party's own class line and had certainlynever argued for the idea of “natural redness.” The charges against TanLifu were distorted and cooked up;everyonerealized that the coupletwasanextremestatement.15Li Hongshan's notoriety drew red guards to the Forestry Institute for aseries of debates. On December 5 Li, with 145 red guards from twenty-three different schools in attendance, read out his wall-poster attack onChen Boda.16 Among those who supported Li that day was Yi Zhenya, aredguardfromnearbyQinghuaUniversity:“Withregard tothequestionof the CCRG,we do not consider the CCRG to be the Party Center.Moreover, especially the slogans put forth by the Third Headquarters,we consider them to be reactionary, as when they say ^we will smash thedog head of anyone who opposes the CCRG' .. . Actually, the CCRG isnot even a party organization, much more some kind of Party Center,and even more so is not some Chairman Mao."17As Yi Zhenya's speech indicates, there were students at Qinghua whoshared Li Hongshan's sentiments. One wall poster began with the decla-ration “The CCRG has committed errors of orientation and line andmust be criticized! . . . They do not carry out Chairman Mao's Proletar-ian Cultural Revolution line of permitting full mobilization of the masses;they are following the“faction boss'[toutou] line. They sit and listen to thefaction bosses’ reports, and give the faction bosses directives, take chargeof faction bosses’ headquarters, busy as all get out."18 A subsequent“Open Letter” addressed to Mao attacked Qi Benyu and Guan Feng, theCCRG members most directly involved in engineering the Third Head-quarters'victory.GuanFeng and QiBenyu are aworkteamin disguisedform,they arenurse-maids, acting in accord with their bourgeois reactionary worldview.. . set-ting restrictions here,setting the tone there,not only unwilling tolisten tothe cries ofthe masses,but according tononsensicalnotions that they takefor granted, they incite the masses to struggle against one another... Guan

183

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteFeng styles himself as the incarnation of the proletarian revolutionary line:absolutely correct, and prepared to strike down those who criticize them.Guan Feng portrays the nation as utterly hopeless, the proletarian dictator-ship as crumbling on theverge of collapse,spreading all kinds of rumorsand slander, plotting to suppress the revolutionary left, and being so pleasedwithhis own cleverness.Infact,GuanFeng and the others have committedsevereerrors;they aretheculpritsresponsibleforthedisastrousnationwidestruggles among the masses.They are scheming to incite the revolutionaryteachers and students of the Third Headquarters to protect them. It is verylikely that Guan Feng and Qi Benyu are careerists and conspirators.19Other dissidents at Qinghua added accusations of their own. One wallposter criticized the CCRG for issuing secret directives during meetingswith Third Headquarters representatives,for constantly insinuating thatPremier Zhou Enlai was a “compromiser” while shamelessly inflating itsown status, for violating the “Sixteen Points” through vicious attacks onTanLifu,an ordinarystudent andmember ofthemasses,andfor con-stantlyleaking secretinner-party documents.20Asecond pointed out thatthe CCRG had been all in favor of wide-open criticism and rebellionuntil it had achieved power, and then it suddenly wanted to shut downthe movement: “Now a lot of people are preparing to criticize the CCRGand debate with Guan Feng and Qi Benyu, but they now want to‘slamon the brakes.'"21 Another wall poster returned to the familiar theme ofthe framing of Tan Lifu. Tan's speech certainly contained very serious er-rors, these authors argued, but Tan was being denounced personally withdubious claims about his reputed “backstage supporters.” This was veryeffective for propaganda purposes, but people ignored the actual contentof his speech;he had simply become a kind of label used to threaten peo-pleandshutoffdebate.22As thewall-poster campaign at Qinghua continued,Jiang Qing cameunder fire for a conspiratorial relationship with Third Headquarters repre-sentatives. Dissidents cited secret meetings during which she had allegedlycalled for a mutual protection pact, actions that showed her fear of themasses and of a genuine mass movement. These were fundamental errorsof standpoint, not strategic errors, according to the critics.23 Anothergroup broadened the criticism to the entire CCRG: “A lot of CCRG mem-bers (like Guan Feng, Qi Benyu, Wang Li) really like to favor certain lead-ers,conferonsecretplans,andthisunavoidablylends asenseofcharismato certain leaders (like Kuai Dafu)and divorces them from the masses, to184

DissentandItsSuppressionthe point of manipulating the masses.”This manipulation of themovementby passing verdicts unilaterally, putting labels on people like Tan Lifu andthe majority red guards, and setting limits on criticism represented a fun-damental error of line and orientation.24At Beida there was never a majority-minority split,but the campaignagainst the CCRG echoed there as well because Nie Yuanzi, under attackby rebel critics at the school, claimed CCRG support as the basis for herposition. One group argued that to continue the Cultural Revolution, itwas now necessary to“bombard the CCRG."“Are criticisms of theCCRG really such a serious and dangerous matter that they are met withthreats? The campaign currently waged by Nie Yuanzi's Cultural Revo-lution Committee against critics of the CCRG is a prime example of thebourgeois reactionary line in action—not trusting masses, fearing criti-cism, pasting labels and intimidating people, just like the errors of thework teams. If this is not the bourgeois reactionary line, then what is?"25

ResistanceintheHighSchoolsThe dissident campaign also reverberated in the high schools and largelyparalleled the arguments by university students that I have already de-scribed.26 One distinctive contributionwas awallposter writtenby twostudents at the Agricultural University High School who wrote under thepen name Yilin Dixi.27 Their “Open Letter to Comrade Lin Biao” criti-cized his attitude toward Mao Thought as “mistaken” and “un-Marxist."They pointed out that his claims for Mao Thought were far in excess ofwhat Lenin and Stalin claimed for themselves.They argued that Lin's sim-plistic campaign centered on the “little red book”of Mao quotations wasfine to indoctrinate peasant recruits in the army, but praising MaoThoughtinthisfashioncouldnotsolvetheproblemsofChinesesocialism.The authors also criticized Lin Biao's conspicuous lack of contact with thestudentmovement.UnlikeZhouEnlai,ChenBoda,andothers,he neverappeared in meetings with students and never involved himself in dia-logues.HowcouldLinbecomeMao'ssuccessor ifhewassotheoreticallyshallowand alooffromthestudentmovement?“ChairmanMaohastakenthisroad,butifChairmanMao'ssuccessorcannotbecomeaproletarianrevolutionary commander, then the Chinese party faces the danger of be-coming a fascist party."28 For obvious reasons this wall poster becamehighly controversial, but in the midst of the dissident campaign the au-thors’ point of view was enthusiastically received in some quarters.29

185

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteMore noteworthy among high-school students was their organized resistance.The high-school picket corps were clearly in serious decline.Now considered“revisionist”red guards, they lost confidence and mem-bers in October and November and were no longer a well-organizedforce witha clearmission.Abandoning their original ideal ofregulatingthe red guard movement, their remaining activists shifted to rear-guardattacks on their opponents. During November they launched sporadicacts of resistance. Around midnight on November 8 more than 100 ofthemburstintotheThirdHeadquartersofficesbehind theTiananmenre-viewing stand, yelling hostile slogans. For the rest of the month remnantsof the Western, Eastern, and Haidian pickets put up wall posters, distrib-uted handbills,and engaged in street clashes with Third Headquartersfighting groups. On November 25 they broke into the Third Headquar-ters offices once again,this time tearing the place apart and injuring someofitsdefenders.30Activists intheHaidianDistrictheld aseries ofdiscussions inlateNo-vember about how to reverse their decline. On November 27 leaders ofBeida High School Red Flag-the rebel students publicly favored by Maoand the CCRG only three months earlier—convened a meeting with like-minded representatives.The Red Flag leaders proposed a new organizationthat would unite their scattered forces and engage in coordinated resis-tance, and the name they settled upon was Liandong (United Action). Therepresentatives who participated in the discussion, all from high schools inHaidian, drafted a founding declaration dated December 5, just as the dis-sident movement was reaching its high point.31 Their declaration was fullyin line with the campaign to criticize the CCRG.Right after the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line there has appeareda bourgeois reactionary line in a new guise, and this is the greatest threatfacing the movement at present. It threatens the victorious accomplishmentsattained through the blood and sweat of the revolutionary masses. It will re-turn the masses once again to a state of oppression under a dictatorship; itwill deprive the masses of their right to educate themselves and liberate them-selves;it will result in the deaths of untold numbers;it will turn back thewheel of history.It threatens us!32Prominent among the organizers of Liandong were the red guards fromQinghua UniversityHigh School whose“Urgent Appeal”in August hadbeen the first protest against red guard violence, and whose sentiments186

DissentandItsSuppressionhad originallyinspired theformation of the picket corps.According toparticipants in these meetings, there was a common concern over the fateof their organizations, but there was little agreement about what steps totaketoreversethattrend.Whatwasmostsignificant aboutthisorganiza-tion was that it included the shining stars of the first month of the Cul-tural Revolution—activists who now declared their opposition to theCCRG.33

DictatorshipasDemocracy:CrushingDissentThese trends bothered the CCRG and its rebel followers.By mid-December the CCRG had heard enough, and it ordered a counterattack.The first moves came in late November.During the last three days of themonth, the Third Headquarters held a large meeting of delegates from itsconstituent organizations to discuss strategies to combat the dissident cam-paign. Chen Boda and Guan Feng attended the opening session and spokeat length with the delegates.34 The counterattack began with the publica-tionof aneditorialintheDecember13issue ofRedFlag thatcharged thatthe dissident campaign was “an attack on the genuine left instigated by asmall group of capitalist roaders.” The editorial was accompanied by anarticlebyWangLi thatextolled theimportance ofexercisingproletariandictatorship over enemies during the course of the Cultural Revolution.35Shortly after the editorial appeared, Jiang Qing met a group of rebel stu-dents who had come to the State Council to celebrate the Red Flag issue,andshetoldtheassembled students,“Wemustresolutelyoverthrow thesmall group of capitalist roaders and reactionaries. Long live the dictator-shipoftheproletariat!Withouttheproletariandictatorship,therecanbeno great democracy!"36 The rebel faction, born as a protest movementagainst the dictatorial practices of the work teams,nowbecame an enthu-siastic proponent of“proletarian dictatorship."OnDecember 14 theCCRGmet withThird Headquarters representa-tives who peppered its members with questions about how to handle thedissident challenge.Theleaders made very clear that it would nolongerbe tolerated. Chen Boda explained that the students and the CCRG de-pended on one another for support: “You must also spur us forward,help us improve.We cannot avoid errors and shortcomings.This is quiteanothermatterthankickingasidetheCCRGordisbandingtheCCRGYou want the CCRG's help, and we also want your help." Kang Shengadded, “We must carry out severe suppression of counterrevolutionaries;

187

ChallengingtheMaoistElitethis is the greatest form of democracy ... Li Hongshan is a little coun-terrevolutionary ringleader,”and“Wemustcarryoutdictatorshipovercounterrevolutionary elements ... Only revolutionaries have freedom ofspeech; without proletarian dictatorship you cannot have great democ-racy;great democracy is a means toconsolidate thedictatorshipof theproletariat.”Afterstudentsnotedthatthedissidentswereclaimingthatthey were not afraid of being branded counterrevolutionaries, just as theminority faction was not afraid of the work teams, Jiang Qing responded,“They will not settle accounts with us; we will settle accounts with them,and “Do not forget that we are the proletarian dictatorship."37 The stu-dents reported that the meeting strengthened their resolve.38An even more dramatic demonstration of the CCRG backlash was aDecember 16 mass meeting of high-school activists at which Jiang Qing'sspeech set the tone for a campaign against the high-school pickets.Just now some classmates spoke about the Western Pickets, Eastern Pickets,and Haidian Pickets. These so-called picket corps had a small group of littlekids carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line. The spearhead of their strug-gle was pointed at you, and this is wrong. Today,we should engage in self-criticism.Weeducatedthempoorly;forty-andsixty-year-oldshavenottaught them properly. Their aristocratic arrogance, thinking that their blood-line is so noble, treating others so rudely—what nonsense!Jiang was not making a self-criticism, however, because her next sentencecontainedapoliticalbombshell:adirectattackontheleaderswhohadworked with Zhou Enlai to organize and supply the picket corps: “But Ibelieve that Zhou Rongxin bears responsibility for this, Yong Wentao alsoisresponsible,andWangRenzhongalsobearsresponsibility.Makethemconfess in front of you, how they supported this small group of bastards tobehave like military policemen."Jiang Qing then called out the apparently unsuspecting officials to standin front of her on the stage and bow their heads to the assembled students,andcontinued,saying,NowIwill talkabit abouttherelationshipbetweendictatorshipanddemoc-racy.Is our proletarian dictatorshipfirm?I think it is basically firm.But insome places, among some people, there is a small group that uses weapons tokill people, beat people. If we cringe and retreat in the face of such people, theproletarian dictatorship is weakened. Without a firm proletarian dictatorship,188

Dissent andItsSuppressionhow can therebegreatdemocracy?Sowemustresolutelyopposethese cringing so-called organs of dictatorship that are unwilling to intervene...Andwemust resolutely carry out dictatorship over this small group of criminalswho murder, beat people, sabotage the revolution.39Jiang made several assertions. First, the picket corps were a violent gangof reactionary murderers, aristocrats who looked down on all other stu-dents. Second, the pickets received support behind the scenes from officialswho pursued the “bourgeois reactionary line.” Third, the officials shenamed worked directly underPremier Zhou Enlai,who was also sitting onthe stage and who was not aware beforehand that Jiang would spring thisaccusation upon his subordinates, clearly threatening him as well.40Kang Sheng spoke next, pressing the point in more specific terms, andbroadenedthelist ofenemiestoinclude theuniversity studentswhoquestioned the CCRG:The victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by ChairmanMao, and the bankruptcy of the bourgeois reactionary line, has turned asmallgroupofcounterrevolutionaryelementsintocorneredbeastswhoareso desperate they will do anything in their last-ditch struggle.

He started by claiming that he"completely agreed”with the speech by Jiang Qing. He then argued thatinanewmovementlikethatoftheredguardserrorswereinevitable,but"it is right to exercise dictatorship as my two comrades have just said."However, Zhou argued, they must recognize that these were very youngpeople, and they should permit them to apologize and explain why theyacted as theydid.41The rebels now understood what was expected, and a wave of repres-sionfollowed.OnDecember 14theminorityfaction at theForestry

Tan was arrested on December 18 and charged with propagatingthe “reactionary bloodline theory”and with “possibly”participating inthe campaign to “bombard the CCRG."44That same day the CCRG and Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi metwith rebel representatives to hear reports about the “arrest of counterrevo-lutionary elements.” Zhang Chunqiao reported on the campaign, andJiangQingfollowedwith a series of detailedinstructions abouthow tosuppress enemies. “Turn the people you have seized over to the Ministry ofPublic Security, not the Bureau of Public Security. The ministry is run bycomradeXieFuzhi,andwetrusthim.TheWesternDistrictBureauofPublic Security has serious problems; we have already sent fifty or sixty com-rades over to reorganize it; the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureauhas real problems." Jiang suggested that Wang Guangmei be dragged backto the Qinghua campus for denunciation, and also Bo Yibo, “because hepersecuted Kuai Dafu.” “As for those who have beaten a lot of people andwho have a bad attitude, you can suppress them, certainly sentence them ifthey are older. The younger ones you can give a provisional death sen-tence.” Guan Feng was more emphatic: “Drag out the behind-the-scenessupporters of the Western Pickets and shoot them without mercy."Jiang did not want the students to unilaterally hold mass struggle ses-sions against their targets; they needed to be properly stage-managed. Shecomplained that students had botched a mass denunciation meeting againstWang Renzhong after they had captured him on their own. She preferredto have the captives taken directly to the Ministry of Public Security to be190

Xu Ming, assistant secretary general of Zhou Enlai's State Council of-fice, wife of Kong Yuan, and mother of Western District Picket Corpsleader Kong Dan, committed suicide on December 23.46Other members of the CCRG met repeatedly with student leaders dur-ing the crackdown.OnDecember 20 LinJie defended the CCRG againstcriticisms, calling them“slander."We must firmly suppress this small group of active counterrevolutionaries.Weare anationunder thedictatorshipoftheproletariat;ourgreatdemoc-racy is a democracy under proletarian dictatorship.

191

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteThe dissident campaign crumbled in the face of this coordinated as-sault. One group,however, staged a final series of defiant gestures beforeits leaders, too, were arrested. The high-school students in Liandongsprang into action with their founding proclamation on December 5,shortly before the repression campaign got under way. Over the nextweekgroups associated with them posted slogans and distributedhand-bills critical of the CCRG at key downtown locations.They alsobeganto appear at rallies and debates on college campuses to refute ThirdHeadquarters’ arguments. They rarely sent more than a few dozen mem-bers, who were quickly surrounded and shouted down.49 One confronta-tiontookplaceonDecember7ataceremonyfortheChina-JapanYouthFriendship Association.As Chairman Liao Chengzhi began speaking,agroup of Third Headquarters militants tried to shout him down and takeover the meeting. Liandong members confronted them, and a heated de-bateensued,withastandoffthatlastedthreehours.EventuallytheThirdHeadquartersrebelsleftindefeat.50Liandong held a mass meeting attended by several thousand studentson December 26. Its leaders’ original intention was to try to repair theirrelationshipwith theCCRGby offering self-criticismsfor their past actions. They issued invitations to the CCRG and leaders of the ThirdHeadquarters, but none of them attended. As the self-critical speechesdroned on, the audience grew increasingly angry that the CCRG did notshow up. Defiant slogans began to ring out in the hall, and several speak-ers surged to the rostrum to lead chants of “Overthrow the bourgeoisreactionary line carried out by certain people on the CCRG.” The crowdwas electrified,and students threw their hats into the air and cheeredloudly.Whenthestudentswatcheddocumentaryfootage ofMao'sred guard rallies in Tiananmen Square, they cheered in approval whenMao,ZhouEnlai,andseniormilitaryofficialswereshown,butwhenCCRG members appeared on the screen, they were loudly jeered. After-ward a large contingent marched to the Forestry Institute to demonstrateat theheadquartersof therebelfaction.51Reports about the meeting reached the CCRG shortly thereafter. Afew days later Qi Benyu called one rebel leader on the telephone to com-plain angrily that his faction was being too soft on Liandong.52 Late inthe evening of January 6, Liandong members engaged in an angry debatewithWang Li and Qi Benyu on the campus of Qinghua High School.Wang and Qi were defiant and unrepentant, and the argument drew alarge and unruly crowd.The next dayLiandong denouncedWang and Qi192

DissentandItsSuppressionin a wall poster.53 The most remarkable of Liandong's acts of defiancewas a series of demonstrations at the Ministry of Public Security.As theinmembers were imprisoned at the ministry,Liandong members repeatedlymarched there to protest.Various sources claim six different confronta-tionsattheministryfrommid-DecembertoearlyJanuary,duringsomeof which students allegedly engaged in vandalism and physically intimi-dated officers in the reception area.54The crackdown on Liandong began in mid-January. On January 17Minister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi claimed that the Cultural Revolu-tion had entered a new stage, and those currently being arrested undernewly tightened public security regulations were counterrevolutionar-ies.55 The same day several Liandong leaders at Beijing Industrial Insti-tuteHighSchoolweredenouncedonastage,butthemassrallywasin-terrupted by more than fifty security officers who arrested them on thespot.

ChallengingtheMaoistElite

FramingtheVictims:TheCampaignagainstthePicketCorpsThe CCRG was not content simply to suppress the dissidents; it felt com-pelled to build a public justification for its actions. After all, the dissi-dents had charged it with manipulative and repressive behavior that closelyparalleled actions of the work teams and Liu Shaoqi. Its reaction—an all-outrepressioncampaignthatexceededanythingobservedundertheworkteams and that broke the long-standing prohibition against the use of se-curity forces against students—appeared tobear out the student critics inexaggerated form. The dissidents had charged the CCRG with carryingout a “bourgeois reactionary line,” and they had crafted an ideological ar-gument for a purge of the CCRG as traitors to the spirit of the CulturalRevolutionandthedirectivesofChairmanMao.TheCCRGrespondedwith an extended nationwide campaign of vilification that distorted themotivesoftherebelsandfalsifiedthehistoricalrecord.The denunciation campaign completely ignored the dissidents’criti-cisms andfocusedinsteadontheallegedlyviolentandreactionarynatureof the picket corps and Liandong.Both were singled out as neofascist or-ganizations that sought to defend the restoration of capitalism.TheywerepartofanallegedconspiracyorchestratedbytheStateCounciloffi-cials who had assisted the picket corps, and through them were linked inunspecified ways to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping (Zhou Enlai, who ac-tually directed these efforts,escaped untouched).The shrillness of the campaign probably stemmed from two sources.The first was that many of the leaders of the picket corps and Liandonghad once been nationally celebratedred guards.Theyhad stood atopTiananmenwithMaointheAugustrallies,had oncebeen closetomem-bers of the CCRG, and had often resisted the work teams in theirschools. To destroy the reputations of national models, one had to accusethemofmajorcrimes.ThesecondwasthattheWesternDistrictPicketCorpshadactuallybeenfoundedasanefforttocurtailtheviolenceofthe red guards, and several top leaders of Liandong were the most out-spokenpubliccriticsofviolentredguards.The portrayal of these organizations and leaders as singularly violentand reactionary served several political purposes. First, it excused theCCRG's manipulations and repressions by painting its victims as crimi-nally violent and reactionary. Second,by pointing to the cadre parentageof many of the key leaders, it alleged political motives designed to defenda privileged “bourgeois”lifestyle.Third,it diverted attention from the194

DissentandItsSuppressionCCRG'sresponsibilityfor violence inthe earlier stages ofthemovementby permitting it belatedly to posture as a champion of nonviolence. Allof this portrayal was an elaborate cover for the primary motivation: thesestudents had the temerity to rebel against the CCRG itself.The campaign to portray the Western District Picket Corps as uniquelyviolentbeganwithacuriousNovember19visitbyChenBodaandseveralCCRG members to Beijing High School No. 6. Chen and his comradeswerereportedlyshocked and outraged to“discover”thatredguardsat theschool had set up a private jail and interrogation center in a basementand had in the past tortured several individuals, resulting in two deaths.What is curious about Chen's “discovery” is that such actions had beenendemic since August, were regularly reported to the CCRG, and had al-readyresultedinthousandsofcasualties.Atthetime,theCCRGhaddownplayed reports of violence in order not to obstruct student mobiliza-tion and in fact had ordered the police and the military not to intervene.Moreover, Beijing No. 6 High School was a short walk from the leadershipcompound of Zhongnanhai.If the CCRG needed evidence of red guard vi-olence,itwasonitsdoorstepall along.Whyhadittakenmorethanthreemonths for the CCRG to notice and act upon torture and murder by redguards?The answer is that it was now politically expedient to do so.The perpe-tratorswere red guards whowere said tohave had a connection to theWestern District Picket Corps, and the victim was a student in an opposedfaction andthereforecountedasafollowerof theCCRG.Themurderedstudent had been killed almost two months before, on September 29.58The casewas brought to the attention of the CCRGwhen students at theschool sent an anonymous report on November 18. It complained that theWestern District Bureau of Public Security would not do anything to bringthe murderers to justice. The perpetrators were described as die-hardmembers of the Western District Picket Corps, and their victim, WangGuanghua, was described as a factional opponent who wrote the first wallposter against school leaders. The anonymous report admitted that othershadearlierdied atthehandsoftheschool'sredguards:“Atthattimetherewerealsopeoplewhowerebeatentodeath,butmostofthemwerelittlehooligans and so forth, so Wang was safe at that point in time."59 Wangwas not just a“little hooligan"—the wrong kind of person was killed.The CCRG had displayed a cavalier attitude toward red guard vio-lence for months, but this time it reacted immediately. The MunicipalParty Committee issued an“Important Notice”forbidding private prisons

ChallengingtheMaoistElitethesamedaytheletterwasdelivered,andwithinforty-eighthoursthenotice was transmitted nationwide as a central party document.60 On theevening of November 19,Chen Boda, Guan Feng, Wang Li, and QiBenyushowedupunannouncedattheschool.Theywentdirectlytotheinterrogationcenterandreleasedanumberofprisoners.Chen angrilyor-dered the facility closed and dressed down the students in charge.Chenlater confronted the chief of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Public Security to ask why he had done nothing to stop such activities, ignoringthe obvious fact that the central authorities had explicitly prohibited thisin lateAugust.61InthecourseofChen'svisithediscoveredthatothershadsufferedinthe interrogation center. An old worker had been tortured to death onlyone week after the red guard Wang Guanghua, and several days later ateacherhadbeendetainedandtorturedbuthadsurvived.Eventssuchasthese had been common in high schools since early summer, and theanonymous letter of complaint did not even bring up these cases.It wasnotthefactofviolencethatdisturbedtheCCRGbuttheidentitiesofthevictim and the perpetrators. The narrowness of the CCRG's concern isreflected in an undated dialogue between students from the school andCCRGmembers:Students: Wang Guanghua was on the verge of death several times,but he

would wake up and shout “struggle with words, not with force!"” res-olutely upholding party policy. Even in his last five minutes, while be-

inggiven artificialrespiration,he still shouted.JiangQing:Hewas aherowhomyou shouldallemulate...QiBenyu:Heputup thefirstwallposter opposing thepartybranch,he can

behavior!62This dialogue inadvertently reveals the core of the CCRG's concern. Thiswas a “leftist” student—the most important point. He was apparentlyfrom a capitalist household, which worried the students, but the CCRGreassured them that he was actually only “small business"(a less reac-tionarydesignation),andinanycasehewasontherightsidepolitically("leftist").Had the student not been a“leftist,”the case would nothavemerited attention. And had the perpetrators not been part of the Western196

After the offendingred guards closed down their interrogation center, they formed a newfighting group. During an early December confrontation with studentswho opposed them, one was stabbed and seriously wounded. The Mu-nicipalBureau ofPublicSecuritystillrespectingexistingprohibitionsfailed to arrest the offenders. When the incident was reported to theCCRG, the counterattack on the dissident red guards was already gettingunder way, and it was clear that the CCRG had a strategy to take advan-tageoftheincident.JiangQing:Washislife saved?Students:He survived.KangSheng:They tried tokill himbecausehewas a traitor?QiBenyu:Maybe theyfeared hewould denounce theWesternPickets.JiangQing:Theywereallcadrekids,absolutelylawless.Students:WecouldnotdoanythingJiang Qing: Do not worry, do not worry, we will help you.The leader of

problems. And Zhou Rongxin cannot deny his responsibility.63Jiang Qing's public denunciation of thehigh-school pickets and ZhouEnlai's aides followed shortly thereafter.The propaganda campaign toshape perceptions of the dissident red guards then swung intofull gear,andtheshrillnessoftheaccusationsfaroutstrippedthecampaigntwomonths earlier against Tan Lifu,whohad never challenged the CCRGand who had meekly stepped off the stage. The No. 6 High School casewas detailed in professionally printed pamphlets that described the crueltreatment meted out to the three victims. One such pamphlet containedtwelve high-resolution photographs of the interrogation center, weapons,torture instruments,and a gruesomely mutilated corpse.A drawing on thecover depicted a building in darkness that looked like a concentrationcamp.64 Other high schools followed suit with descriptions of similar deten-tion centers on their campuses, reportedly the work of “"Western Picket-type” red guards.65The campaign against the Western District Picket Corps for the atroci-ties atNo.6HighSchool blended seamlessly with the campaign againstLiandong, and the propaganda materials made little distinction betweenthem. The materials on No. 6 High School were included in printed

197

ChallengingtheMaoistElitepamphlets and professionally printed books that detailed the allegedcrimes of Liandong, an organization that was described in similar terms. Inone book, devoted to a public exhibition held at the August 1 School thatdisplayed the“crimes ofLiandong,”theWesternDistrictPicket Corps wasdescribed as Liandong's “predecessor organization,” and the No. 6 HighSchool events were attributed to “Liandong elements."66 Liandong and theWestern District Picket Corps were accused of “opposing the CCRG,"“trampling the Sixteen Points,”“suppressing the mass movement,” andengaging in violence while carrying out “white terror” in Beijing highschools.They“attacked the Third Headquarters”and even the Ministry ofPublic Security.67 Locally produced pamphlets often failed to charge“Liandongelements”with thekind of murderous violence allegedly typi-cal of the Western District Picket Corps. The denunciation of Beida HighSchool Red Flag produced by its opponents charged it with ten “greatcrimes,” all but one of which amounted simply to criticizing either theCCRGortheThirdHeadquarters.Theonlychargeregardingviolencewasthat it had “incited students to struggle against students."68The denunciations stressed that these red guards were proponents ofthe reactionary “bloodline theory” of“natural redness."Proud and arro-gant about theirrevolutionaryheritage,they were said tohave issuedarmbandsthatvariedaccordingtotherankoftheirparentsinthena-tional bureaucratic hierarchy.69 The August 1 School was portrayed as abastion of privilege whose students from high-ranking households led adissolute bourgeois lifestyle, and the roots of their aristocratic privilegewere tracedto anelementary schoolfor the children of privileged off-cials, denounced as a “cradle of revisionism."70 The violent activities ofthe Western District Picket Corps were traced to the machinations ofproven traitors like Yong Wentao, Zhou Rongxin, and others, who al-legedly directed their violent efforts to defend the status quofrom behindthescenes.71The campaign tried hard to discredit the dissident red guards and tiethem to a nationwide conspiracy.Accounts published after Mao's deathclaimed that the exhibition at the August 1 School was largely fabricated.Rebels, not “Liandong elements,” had in fact caused the damage to theschool when they assaulted the campus.The luxury consumer goods putondisplaytoillustratetheirprivilegedlifestylewereborrowedfromtheMinistry of Foreign Trade, and the cache of daggers and iron bars in factwas on loan from the Bureau of PublicSecurity.72 Some of the documentsattributed to Liandong were obvious forgeries.The clearest example is198

DissentandItsSuppressionthe purported minutes of a secretLiandong meetingheld in the centralleadership compound of Zhongnanhai on October 1, two months beforethe organization was actuallyestablished.The document openly declaredopposition to both Mao and Lin Biao. The minutes were distributed as amock “Central Document" allegedly issued on January 1, 1967. It calledfor the children of party cadres to organize themselves nationwidestrictly according to the rank of their parents.73 It portrayed Liandong asplotting a political coup to subvert Mao and the Cultural Revolution.Thesematerialsleftlittledoubtabouttheconclusionsthatreaderswereto draw: “In light of this it is not at all surprising that “Liandong’ ele-mentsfuriouslycarriedoutthebourgeoisreactionaryline.Liandong’isnow behaving crudely, like mad dogs. Whoever is revolutionary, they op-pose. Whoever is reactionary, they support. They crave nothing morethan chaos nationwide.Although they receive enthusiastic applause andsecret overtures from clowns in Moscow and Washington, they have longago been spurned by the broad masses."74In this fashion the only red guards ever to publicly protest red guardviolence and the only organization formed to prevent it were portrayedthroughoutChinatocredulousaudiencesasaneofascistorganizationthat specialized in violence and torture to defend its class privileges. TheofficialswhoworkedunderZhouEnlaitorestrainredguardviolencethrough the picket corps and other means—in a period when Mao andthe CCRG willfully turned a blind eye—were painted as sponsors of vio-lence in the service of a reactionary cause.These claims would distort anentire generation of research on the red guard movement abroad,andthey were firmly believed by red guards in other regions of China whoread these materials and repeated their claims in subsequent years.75Some red guards mistakenly interpreted the attacks on Liandong as anopportunity to express ideas well outside the mainstream.The most fa-mous example was the essay “On Class Origin,”a protest by a studentof capitalist class origin against the entire system of state-sponsored dis-crimination based on class labels. This essay did not appear until January1967, as the attacks on Liandong reached their height.76 The author andhissupportersbelievedthattheattacksonLiandongforitsalleged“re-actionary bloodline theory” gave them an opening to denounce the entiresystem of class labels. Unfortunately for them, they miscalculated. Thiswas a denial of the party's class line, which none of the critics of Lian-dong had ever intended. The essay became highly controversial and waswidely denounced by rebel organizations throughout the city. The author

199

ChallengingtheMaoistEliteof the essay, Yu Luoke, was arrested at the end of 1967 and executed inMarch 1970.77 There was, in fact, no debate between Yu Luoke and thealready-defunct Liandong,and the viewpoint of Yu's essay,no matterhow appealing it may have been in some circles, played no role in defin-ing red guard factions in the Beijing.

LiandongResponds:ViolenceandCulpabilityLiandong's answer to the CCRG was not circulated in the denunciationmaterials, but its leaders did offer a response shortly before they disap-peared intoprison.OnJanuary8KuangTaoshengof the QinghuaHighRed Guards put up a wall poster, “To the CCRG,” that was based on adraft by Luo Xiaohai, one of the group's founders.78 These students wereboth members of Liandong and authored the August 1966 condemna-tionsofredguardviolence.The authors argued that the charges of violence and murder were anobvious cover for arresting critics of the CCRG. They acknowledgedthat some of those arrested had indeed killed people and should be pun-ished according to the law, but the arrests were highly selective:“Beatingand killing certainly is not something done by these few individuals, andthese are not the chief instigators or the primary culprits. The error ofbeating and killing people has been committed by many thousands of redguards.” Moreover, many of those being arrested were not charged withany kind of violence, like “the young students who have spoken out tocriticize or oppose the CCRG but who have not engaged in any illegalactivities, like the leaders of the [Aeronautics Institute] August 1 Corps.The authors hit on the weakest point of the CCRG's denunciationcampaign by emphasizing the fact that the founders of Liandong had ac-tually been among the first to denounce violence, and that the WesternDistrictPicketCorpshadbeenformedtoprevent it.With regard to violence, the CCRG completely denies its own culpabilityand has turned Yong Wentao, Zhou Rongxin, Wang Renzhong, and certainred guards into scapegoats ... On August 6 our red guards and the redguards from People's University and Aeronautics Institute high schools dis-tributed an “Urgent Appeal” against violence and gave copies to all themain leaders of the CCRG,but the CCRG still did not utter a word.Be-cause oftheCCRG'serror,bythe end ofAugust,when thewave ofviolencecrested with death and injuries widespread, we were very distressed! We200

DissentandItsSuppressionthought it was very strange; why did the CCRG ignore all this killing? ..:OnAugust 20our red guards issued“TenAppraisals”to opposeviolence，to oppose sole emphasis on class background,and to protect the“SixteenPoints"...But by then violence had spread throughout the country, caus-ing great damage to the entire party. Even so, the CCRG only issued appealsin opposition to violence; it never adopted any effective measures ... Andso to this very day violence is still rampant and widespread, the CCRGfinallyhurries tomake speeches and punish afewpeople.This isfiring afterthe fact, it is already too late, the damage is already done. Why do so littlein the beginning and only start to arrest people now? People cannot helpbutask.The authors pinned the responsibility on the CCRG by pointing out thatits manipulations and casual attitude towardviolence created adeeplyfactionalized and violent movement nationwide, “a wave of violence unprece-dented under socialism.” “The CCRG, in pushing all the responsibilitydown ontothelowerlevels,ontothemasseslike this,oughttobe ashamedto call themselves communists."Liandong's counterarguments were lost in the denunciation campaign asits members disappeared into prison. It is one of the many cruel ironies oftheCulturalRevolutionthattheonlystudentstospeakoutagainstvio-lencefrom the outset of the movementwere tobe remembered as itsmostenthusiastic and arrogant practitioners. Moreover, the officials who sup-ported the Western District Picket Corps in its attempts to restrain violencewere tobe charged with supporting and promoting it.Perhaps the mosttellingdistortionoftherecordistheportrayaloftheseredguards’motiva-tions. Eager to denounce the students as agents of a high-level conspiracyagainst Mao's Cultural Revolution, the CCRG portrayed them as reac-tionaries trying to defend their privileged positions in the status quo. In re-ality, the motivations of the dissidents and Liandong closely paralleledthose of the minority faction before its triumph: they were trying to extri-cate themselves from the consequences of landing on the wrong side of anunanticipatedshiftinCulturalRevolutionpolitics.Just as themembers ofthe minority faction tried to extricate themselves from the labels giventhembyworkteamsbyattackingtheministrieswheretheyworked,thedissident red guards attacked offcials who had turned on them and had la-beled them “revisionist red guards.” The motives were rooted in politicalinteractions during the course of the movement; they were not inherent inthe position of the participants in the status quo ante.

8FACTIONSREBORN

NetworksatCross-PurposesSoon after the CCRG and its rebel allies crushed the dissident red guardsthe rebels themselves split into warring factions. Unlike the dissidents, nei-therrebelfactionchallengedtheCCRG.Instead,theywerequarrelsomeallies whose mutual infighting was a source of enormous frustration fortheir elite sponsors. The rebels were not divided about the aims of themovement, nor did the CCRG openly favor one side over the other. Thestudents resisted repeated pleas to unite and became a political liability anda distracting sideshow to themain thrust of theCultural Revolution.In theend, Mao shut down the student movement in disgust, put China undermartial law, emptied the campuses, and sent all students to be remoldedthroughmanuallabor.During the struggles of 1966 rebels largely remained within separatebureaucratic systems when they attacked officials. Rebels from other uni-versities under the same ministry were natural allies, and their combinedstrength made success morelikely.When they attacked the ministries inthe fall, their targets were clear: the work teams and the higher offcialswho defended them.But after the work-team issue was settled and redguards went to government agencies to seize power, rebel groups had tochoose which internal ministry faction to support. This was a much morecomplicated question, and they easily fell into disagreements when stu-dent rebels from different schools went to government agencies and hadto decide which rebel group within the agency represented the “revolu-tionary cadres"whodeserved toinherit the mantle ofpower.Differentchoices among student groups turned them from allies into competitorswhosupporteddifferentfactions.The central fulcrum of the citywide split was Beida and Qinghua, thetwo largest campuses with the two most prominent rebel leaders. Despite204

FactionsRebornthefameofNieYuanziandKuaiDafu,rebelforcesattheseschoolsweredeeply divided. The splits were not between majority and minority fac-tionsbutamongtherebelsthemselves.Becauseneitherfactionateitherschoolwasidentifiedwith the“conservative”university majority,the sup-pression of dissident red guards did not eliminate the rivalries. And be-cause both sides at each school claimed the mantle of the rebel movement,theCCRGdidnottakesidesbutinsteadurgedthetwosides tounite.

TangledNetworks:TheAbortiveBeijingCommuneAttheendof1966MaodecidedthattheCulturalRevolutionhadreachedacrucialphase:rebelswhomobilizedtoroutthe“bourgeoisreactionary line”should now seize power in state organs. Not until Febru-ary would it be clear what form the new organs of power would take, butthe old leaders of state agencies would be swept aside. In the provinces, co-alitionsof“revolutionary”officials,studentredguards,andrebelworkersinvaded government offices and took over key departments in regional"power seizures.” The most famous case was Shanghai's January Revolu-tion,anoperationcoordinatedbytheCCRGanditsShanghaimembersZhangChunqiao andYaoWenyuan,where theincumbentpartysecretaryand mayor were deposed by a coalition of rebel groups on January 6. Inlate January they announced the formation of the Shanghai Commune,whichwould replace the old Shanghai Party Committee and serve as a na-tional model for revolutionized governments.1In Beijing, Mao and the CCRG were eager to enlist their loyal studentrebels to carry out this task. In mid-January Qi Benyu encouraged fac-tions within national ministries to seize power and not wait for permis-sion from higher levels to do so.2 On January 17 he encouraged rebelleaders from universities and state organs to imitate Shanghai.3 Studentsimmediately began plans for a coalition to seize power inBeijing. NieYuanzi called for seizing the Beijing municipal government on January18, and on January 27 she and Kuai Dafu announced the Beijing Com-mune, whose goal was to take over the city government and set up a rep-resentativeassemblytorulethecapitalaccordingtotheprinciplesoftheParisCommune.4Theeffortwasdoomedfromthebeginningbecausetheorganizingcom-mittee itself was in disarray. Red guard leaders rushed off to seize power atdefenseless government offces, and several competing groups arrived withthe same purpose in mind. Not surprisingly, confusion reigned.5 Worse,

205

NetworksatCross-Purposesthese uncoordinated power grabs created new conflicts among rebel or-ganizations and soon divided the student movement once again. This newsplit was unrelated to the factional divide of 1966 and had different causes.Throughout 1966 students were divided about campus-level events, andthe minority and majority factions had different views about the directionof the movement. The divisions of early 1967, by contrast, were based onrivalries among the rebel groups.The opening wedge for this new split wascompetitiontoseizepowerinstateagencies.DuringtheministryinvasionsofSeptemberandOctober1966stu-dents generally attacked separate agencies andwere concerned onlywiththeirschools’workteams.Ifrebelsfrommorethanoneuniversityshowed up,they were natural allies,and cooperation was advantageous.Now, however, red guard groups were no longer insulated from one an-other in separate bureaucratic hierarchies. Any red guard group could par-ticipate in a power seizure in any government organ. Also, a power seizurewas a limited good. After the first power seizure, a second attempt to seizepowerinstantly created conflict.The staff of virtually all state agencies hadby this time mobilized into contending rebel factions,and now rebelgroups from a variety of universities arrived to align themselves with oneor another of these internal factions in order to seize power. This was fer-tilegroundforrivalryandconflict.A prime examplewas BeijingDaily,one of the most visible unitsin thecity. In mid-January delegations from the leading rebel factions—Beida,Qinghua, Beijing Normal, and the Aeronautics and Geology institutessetupajointcommitteetoseizepower.OnJanuary18BeijingNormalJinggangshan aligned itself with several rebel factions on the paper's staffand created a“power seizure committee.”It announced a power seizureon January 21. However, Aeronautics Red Flag had already set up a sep-arate committee with a different staff faction and was unhappy about be-ing preempted. It promptly declared a “second power seizure” and tookover the paper. The Beijing Normal faction protested, and it was supportedby Geology East Is Red, which denounced the “fake power seizure,” pulledoutofthejointcommittee,anddenouncedAeronauticsRedFlagfora“serious error of line.” The two sides fought for control until the newspaperwas put under army control in March.6A parallel exampleis theMinistryofHigherEducation.NieYuanzisentrebelsfromBeidatoseizetheministryonJanuary19.Thenextdaya separate ministry rebel group seized power from the first, and it had thebacking of Beijing Normal Jinggangshan, headed by Tan Houlan. An206

FactionsRebornargument ensued over which ministry faction to support. Nie's groupcharged that the leader supported by Beijing Normal had serious histori-cal problems. Tan Houlan, however, represented the views of her RedFlag and CCRG sponsors, Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Qi Benyu, who hadalready cultivated the leader whose credentials Nie Yuanzi now ques-tioned. Nie was pressured by aggressive phone calls from these figures,but she refused to back down. The ministry rebels aligned with BeijingNormal recruited allies to demonstrate against NieYuanzi at Beida fromJanuary 24 to 26.7 The standoff at the ministry continued and culmi-nated in an overnight battle on February 1 that injured more than 100people. Nie yielded only after threats from Chen Boda, who forced her towithdraw her forces and apologize to Tan Houlan.8 A similar clash oc-curred over theJanuary15 seizure of secretparty archives atthe CCP'sUnitedFrontWorkDepartment.Yetanotherexamplewasthetensionbetween rebel factions from Agricultural University and the Forestry In-stituteattheMinistryofAgriculture,whichculminatedinarmedcon-frontations in April and extensive destruction of the premises.10In these episodes university rebels became entangled in the internalfactional politics of government personnel. To seize power, an outsidegrouphad to form a pact with one of the inside factions.This immedi-ately put it at odds with rebels in the opposed internal faction. Whenother university factions arrived to seize power, they could not do so un-less they found internal allies. If they wanted to lead their own powerseizure instead of simply signing on to the existing effort, they had tofinddifferentinternalallies.Theonlyonesavailablewerefactionsthatwere opposed to thefirstpower seizure.Once the outside rebels formedsuch an alliance,they were drawn into the factional disputes within thegovernment agency and fell into conflict with the university rebels whosupported theotherside.11The CCRG,aware of these problems,tried briefly to start over. Itcalled for a“great alliance” of all factions before any attempted powerseizure. In meetings during the last week of January, Chen Boda and JiangQingtoldstudentstocombinetheirorganizationsintoanalliedstructureto seize power from the city government, even though more than thirtyorganizations had already occupied its offces.12 In response, BeijingNormal Jinggangshan sent a letter to the CCRG nominating Qi Benyu toorganize the citywide power seizure.13 GeologyEast Is Red laterinitiateda separate effort to form a joint headquarters, and other organizing com-mittees soon appeared.By early February factions began withdrawing

207

Networks atCross-Purposesfrom one headquarters to form others, and some groups joined several si-multaneously.14 The effortfell apart.The splits created by power seizures exacerbated existing divisions onthe two largest campuses, Beida and Qinghua. Although Nie Yuanzi andKuai Dafu aspired to seize power in Beijing, they had yet to unify theirown schools’rebel forces.Both leaders were strongly supported by theCCRG,but they faced broadlybased and deeply rooted opposition ontheir own campuses. In both schools the opposition was led by former al-liesofNieandKuai,individualswithclearrebelcredentialsandtiestotheThird Headquarters. When cross-school rebel rivalries combined with theintraschooldivisionsatBeidaandQinghua,theoutcomewaspoliticallyexplosive and split the Beijing red guards to the very end.

Beida:TroubleatGroundZeroDespite Mao's praise for Nie Yuanzi's wall poster, she found herself in apoliticallyawkwardpositionastheredguardmovementtookoffinthelate summer of 1966.Nie was a senior cadre at Beida—a general branchsecretary and veteran Yan'an-era communist.15 Moreover, she had coop-erated with the university's work team and had not openly split with ituntil shortly before it was withdrawn.Her position at Beida was due en-tirely to the visits of the CCRG to the school at the end of July.16In August and September, as minority factions on other campuses mobi-lized to protest the work teams’ actions and overthrow campus majorities,Nie wasfirmly entrenched in power.There was noBeida minorityfaction.There was never an opposition movement against the Beida work team,and no more than a handful of students could claim to be victims. Duringthe long struggle by Beijing's minority factions to unseat school CulturalRevolution committees,Nie and her comrades stood conspicuously on thesidelines.Two separate developments converged into an anti-Nie movement inOctober 1966. The first was resistance to Nie's attempt to control the redguards. Nie established the Beida Red Guards on August 19, but rival or-ganizations proliferated. By mid-October there were three large red guardalliances on campus, representing more than 3,0o0 student activists. Dur-ingthepriortwomonthstheyhadconductedmorethan5oohousesearches and untold numbers of interrogations and struggle sessions.17 Toassert her authority, Nie created a single hierarchy of departmental Cul-turalRevolutioncommitteesandaparallelcommandstructureforred

guards. She appointed Sun Pengyi, a political instructor, longtime Philos-ophyDepartmentally,andmemberoftheCulturalRevolutioncommittee, to head the Beida Red Guards.18 Their founding declaration of Sep-tember 21 ordered all red guards to obey Sun's leadership. New leaderswould be chosen,and unauthorized activities across department linesmustcease.19This attempt to control the red guards was immediately challenged bythe two large groups that rivaled the official Beida Red Guards. They ob-jected that this“so-calledunity”was imposedfrom aboveanddid notrepresent the opinions of the majority.Sun Pengyi's red guards, they ar-gued, should be considered only one branch of Beida's red guard move-ment.Theseparatebranchesshouldhaveequalstatus.Theyreservedtheright to criticize Sun's red guards in wall posters and speeches.20The second development was a wave of criticismfrom university rebelsthat challenged Nie's rebel credentials and criticized her dictatorial ten-dencies. On October 6 a wall poster criticized Nie and called for her res-ignation.It charged that the elections were worthless,the candidatelistswere manipulated, and the leaders were unrepresentative. It accused Nieof using rebel publications to pump up her own reputation by repeatedlycelebrating the famous wall poster.?1 Belittling her “rebellion,”" it pointedout that her wall poster appeared ten days after the Politburo decision topurge Peng Zhen and reverse the verdict on the Beida Socialist EducationMovement.Finally, it charged that Nie ignored dissenting views and sup-pressed criticism.22 In response, Nie's Cultural Revolution committeecalled for a “great debate.” In the weeks that followed, one side affirmedNie and her Cultural Revolution committee, while the other accused her of"suppressing the masses,” behaving like the work team, and carrying outa “covert bourgeois reactionary line."23A long critical essay byYang Xun,an instructor in economics whohad been the department's representative on the preparatory committee,expressed the frustrations of many in the school and articulated a power-ful critique of Nie's actions.24 Yang was a veteran party member who hadgone south with the Eighth Route Army.Demobilized as an administra-tor,shewassentasacadre-studenttoChinesePeople'sUniversityandwasassignedtoBeida'sEconomicsDepartmentasaninstructorin1957.Yanghadbeen an activist duringBeida'sSocialistEducationMovementon the same side as Nie, taking a critical stand against Lu Ping.25 Yangwas elected to the Beida Preparatory Committee, but not to the CulturalRevolutioncommittee,forreasonsconnectedtohercritique

According to Yang, the leaders had become intoxicatedwith self-worship. They ignored criticism and attacked those with dissent-ing views, and the movement was becoming increasingly bureaucratizedand regulated, losing its mass character. Yang raised a sensitive point: Niehad fully cooperated with the work team's “right-wing opportunist line"and had been one ofits main architects. She had attacked large numbers ofcadres, instructors, and party members, yet she acted as if she bore no re-sponsibility for this. Instead, Nie had defensively warned against “peoplewith ulterior motives” who sought to “attack genuine revolutionary left-ists."YangexplainedthatNiehadrefusedtodiscusshercriticismsintheearly days of the preparatory committee, and when she persisted, she waslabeled a“fakeleftist”and subjected to criticism and accusations for thenext twomonths,sabotagingher candidacyfortheCulturalRevolutioncommittee.Yang charged that Beida's Cultural Revolutionwas distortedbyNie'sattemptstocoverupherpasterrors.ThepublicationofsuchcriticisminXinBeidashowedthatthecriticshad sympathizers on the Cultural Revolution committee—in particularKong Fan, standing committee member and first-ranking deputy chair-man, and Yang Keming, editor of Xin Beida.

Yang Keming was fired as editor of Xin Beida, and the “greatdebate”about NieYuanzi's leadership ended.The paper reverted topraiseforNieYuanzi and herfamous wallposter.YangXunwas denounced asan“opportunist" in the November 5 issue, and several groups opposed toNieinvadedtheeditorialofficesandhaltedfurtherpublicationuntilNo-vember21.27This leadership split crystallized factional alignments.KongFan,YangKeming,andtheiralliesjoinedwithdissidentredguards,whilepro-NieforcesconsolidatedcontrolovertheCulturalRevolutioncommitteeandSun Pengyi's red guards.

Nie's followers accused the op-position of following the“bourgeois reactionaryline”because“toopposeNie Yuanzi is to oppose the CCRG."29Although Nie faced a mounting rebellion at Beida, her ties with theCCRG strengthened.On November 16,at Mao's request,Nie led a del-egation toShanghai to assist rebels there.30 Nie remained there foralmost a month, making critical speeches about the Shanghai party leader-ship and encouraging the challengers with news that the CCRG supportedtheir cause.31 She returned to Beijing for a December 16 meeting with theCCRG to report on her efforts.32Ironically, while Nie was fomenting rebellion in Shanghai, she was be-ing attacked as a conservative at Beida. Her opponents joined the ThirdHeadquarters, the rebel alliance of minority factions.33 Emboldened byher CCRG ties and the crackdown on dissident red guards,Niemoved tocrush her opponents.OnDecember 12 her forces seizedYang Xun'syounger brother Yang Bingzhang and Qiao Jianwu, a student in the East-ern Languages Department, as “counterrevolutionaries."34 On December19 Nie falsely charged that her opponents were part of the dissident cam-paign to oppose the CCRG and had their leaders captured and subjectedtomass struggle sessions.Four dayslater she shut down and occupiedtheir offices. In praising these actions, Xin Beida called for a “life-and-death struggle of all revolutionary teachers and students to defeat thecounterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line."35Nie'srebelcredentialswerebasedonhertiestotheCCRG,whichinturn were based on Mao's fulsome praise, and this ultimately permittedher to fend off the rebels who opposed her as a “conservative." On De-cember 29 the Beida Cultural Revolution Committee organized a massstruggle meeting at the BeijingWorkers’Stadium against the entire lead-ership of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee.36 During this pe-riod Nie met several times with Jiang Qing and Kang Sheng, who assuredher of their continued support and affirmed that her critics were counter-revolutionaries.37 On December 24 Nie spoke to a mass meeting at Beida,charged that her opponents were counterrevolutionaries, and called for“exercising proletarian dictatorship."38 Yang Xun, her younger brotherYang Bingzhang, and QiaoJianwu were arrested and sent to prison.39 On

Qinghua:ObjectionstoaRisingStarAt Qinghua the splits in the rebel camp appeared somewhat later. Likethose at Beida,however, they were a reaction against a leader who rose pri-marily because of sponsorshipby the CCRG.Qinghua's minorityfaction,the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards. dominated the campus by the endof September and led the campaign against the work team and the “bour-geois reactionary line."44 The majority red guards disbanded on September29. Kuai Dafu was a marginal figure in the minority movement, wellknown for his stand against the work team and his subsequent victimiza-tion, but not influential. Kuai did not establish his own rebel organization,the Jinggangshan Red Guards, until September 24, after he was singled outby the CCRG to attend the founding meetings of the Third Headquarters,was appointed deputy head of the new organization, and held personal au-diences with CCRG members.45 His star rose after the prominent role heplayed at the gigantic October 6 rally, and as CCRG support for him be-came increasingly clear, his group attracted new adherents and became amajorforce at Qinghua.By earlyDecemberhe beganefforts to unify all theexistingrebelgroupsunderhiscommand.Theseeffortswereblessedby theCCRG when Zhang Chunqiao came to the campus on December 18 andurged him to unite the rebel forces at Qinghua. Zhang's instructions werecirculated on the campus, and the next day Kuai announced the establish-ment of the Jinggangshan Corps, which merged his group with the olderminority faction, the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards.46212

FactionsRebornKuai's attempt tounify andlead therebelforcesquickly collapsed.Like that of Nie Yuanzi at Beida, Kuai's authority was based on his con-nections with higher-level political figures,not on a long grassrootsstruggle during which he had solidified his ties to other prominent rebels.Because he enjoyed such strong backing from above, Kuai understand-ably viewed himself as the voice of the CCRG at Qinghua. Once he as-sumedleadershipoftheschool'srebels,heproceededtomakedecisionsafter consultation with the CCRG, informing other prominent rebelleaders afterward.He evenhadhis“collected works”published at theend of 1966 in an obvious effort to bolster his prestige.47 This struckmany rebels as presumptuous and arrogant. The leaders of the MaoZedong Thought Red Guards, and even some of Kuai's allies from hisJinggangshan Red Guards, resented what they saw as Kuai's growing im-periousness.48 Accustomed to collective leadership with wide-ranging in-ternal debates, the other leaders openly criticized Kuai. He respondedwith harsh intolerance, driving many of his allies into the opposition andirrevocably splitting Qinghua's rebel movement.The problems began near the end of December, and by mid-February1967 the battle lines were clearly drawn. During Kuai's December 18meetingwith Zhang Chunqiao,Zhang instructed Kuai to strike directlyagainst the author of the “bourgeois reactionary line,”Liu Shaoqi.With-out prior discussion with others, on December 19 and 22 Kuai's groupdemanded that Wang Guangmei, Wang Renzhong, and Bo Yibo return tothecampusforself-criticism.4OnDecember25Kuaiorganizedsome5,000 Qinghua students to march downtown, chanting slogans that calledfor the overthrow of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping along the route toTiananmen Square.50 Tang Wei, one of the original founders of Qinghua'sminorityfactionandaprominentrebelleader,objectedtoattackingLiuShaoqi and openly withdrew from Jinggangshan's leadership group. In aDecember 24 wall poster he cited recent statements by Zhou Enlai thatLiu Shaoqi's case had not yet been decided by the Party Center. Tangformed a separate group to challenge Kuai's unilateral decisions, whichhe characterized as “manipulating the masses."51Tang Wei's challenge unsettled Jinggangshan, and mixed signals fromthe national leadership exacerbated the divisions. On December 30 JiangQing, Wang Li, Guan Feng, and Yao Wenyuan appeared at Qinghuapraised Kuai Dafu's December 25 march, and urged further attacksagainst thebourgeois reactionaryline.52But thenextday ZhouEnlai

NetworksatCross-Purposestold Jinggangshan leaders that their demand to bring Wang Guangmeiback to Qinghua had not yet been approved by Mao, and that he dis-agreed with the slogan “overthrow Liu Shaoqi."53 On January 2 TangWei and two otherrebelleadersestablished theMao ZedongThoughtColumn. They issued a statement explaining that they were withdraw-ing from Jinggangshan because Kuai was manipulating the masses andinflating his personal prestige. Tang's group called a mass criticismmeeting of the entire school on January 3 that was well attended.54Undeterred, on January 6 Kuai sent several dozen followers to BeijingNormal High School No. 1 to kidnap Wang Guangmei's daughter, LiuPingping. They took her to a local hospital and placed an urgent call toher mother, pretending that she had been in a serious accident andneededherpermissiontoperformanoperation.WhenWangGuangmeiarrived at the hospital, she was captured and taken back to the Qinghuacampusfor a struggle session that lasted seven hours.55Tang Wei's group opposed the struggle session. Its members argued thatKuai was going far beyond what their collective leadership had agreed toand neither action was clearly sanctioned byMao.ZhouEnlai wasfuriousabout the kidnapping of Wang Guangmei and criticized it bitterly in publicmeetings the next day. One of Kuai's loyal fighting groups, Regiment 28,argued that his followers’action was correct and responded that Kuai'scritics were “spokesmen for the bourgeois reactionary line."56 At a massdebate called by the opposition on January 7, Kuai's supporters broughtslogans denouncing “the counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line."Tang Wei's supporters countered that Kuai's group was a “new conserva-tive faction” that failed to listen to the masses and was now attacking andmanipulating them. Kuai's group attacked Tang Wei for creating splits, op-posing “newborn red power,” and carrying out a counterattack on behalfof the defeated majority faction.57Kuai's response parroted the CCRG's reaction to the dissident redguards and occurred in the midst of the suppression campaign againstLiandong. Kuai was adopting the same stance taken by Nie Yuanzi atBeida: he was supported by the CCRG; to oppose him was to oppose theCCRG, and to oppose the CCRG was an expression of the “bourgeois re-actionary line."” Predictably, Kuai's former rebel allies refused to acceptthis sophistry, and the accusation served only to deepen the split.In thedays following the debate,several new“regiments”wereformed throughdefections from Jinggangshan. Among the defectors were famous early214

They hadlong condemned Zhou's “compromising” attitude, especially after hissternreactiontothestrugglesessionagainstWangGuangmei.Moreserious, however, was a January 18 wall poster criticizing Kang Sheng.Regiment28targetedKangbecauserebelsattheCentralPartySchoolaccused Kang of backing the school's president, now disgraced as a re-visionist.TheCCRGrespondedwitha severity that equaled itsreactionat aboutthesametimetotheGeologyInstitute'sZhuChengzhao.Inharshly worded notes and middle-of-the-nightphone calls onJanuary22, both Chen Boda and Guan Feng ordered Kuai to halt the attackson Kang Sheng.$9 Jiang Qing openly criticized him about this in an au-dience with red guard leaders the following evening.60 Unlike ZhuChengzhao at the Geology Institute, who persisted in his unorthodox no-tions and was ejected from the rebel movement, Kuai quickly steppedbackinline.Kuai's missteps encouraged his opponents. They now accused bim of"bombarding the proletarian headquarters” and “opposing the CCRG."Kuai was forced to make a self-criticism in front of the CCRG.61 His op-ponents mobilized several mass meetings to demand changes in Jing-gangshan's leadership and criticized Kuai for opposing the CCRG andsuppressing the masses—carrying out a“new bourgeois reactionaryline."” They turned Kuai's own inflated accusations back on him, havingbeen handed a perfect opportunity to do so.62Kuai's January 27 self-criticism was also a counterattack. He acknowl-edged his errors but charged that “certain people” were trying to capital-ize on them to put pressure on the CCRG. His opponents, he chargedwere Trotskyites and political speculators, opportunists trying to subvertthe proletarian headquarters and restore the Liu-Deng bourgeois reac-tionary line. His followers attacked the critics, arguing that criticisms ofKuai were an attempt to reverse the verdict on Liu Shaoqi. The incendi-ary charge of Trotskyism incited an outraged response among thein-creasinglydisaffectedQinghuarebelswhoweredismayedbyKuai'sim-perious behavior, which some felt verged on megalomania.63To secure its loose cannon,the CCRG sent a staff member to informKuai that it was wrong tolabelhis critics in this manner.64 This further

In early Feb-ruarysixlarge anti-Kuai organizations issued a joint declarationthat de-mandedaretraction ofhisinflatedchargesandnewelectionsforschoolleadership bodies.65 The rebel movement at Qinghua was irrevocablysplit. Kuai had permanently alienated a large bloc of Qinghua rebels.

ForcedUnity:TheCapitalRedGuardCongressBytheendof1966Maowasalreadydisillusionedwiththedividedstu-dent movement and placed his hopes increasingly on the working class.66The exaggerated celebration of the Shanghai power seizure, in which in-dustrial workers played the decisive role, signaled this shift. Whether itwas because of the students’inept attempts at power seizures inBeijingthe political incompetence of hand-picked leaders at Beida and Qinghuawho split rebel forces on their own campuses,or his concern to preservethe gains of Shanghai's January Revolution, Mao came down decisivelyin favor of an authoritarian solution. On February 12 Mao told ZhangChunqiao that his new government would not be a “Shanghai Com-mune” of mass representatives, but instead a “Revolutionary Commit-tee” with a strong army representation and full powers of “proletariandictatorship.'"67Mao also had other plans for Beijing. On February 1 Qi Benyu andXieFuzhi toldrebelsthatQiwouldnotbeinchargeofBeijing'spowerseizure; the task required firm handling by public security forces. XieFuzhi, minister of public security, and Fu Chongbi, commander of theBeijing Garrison, would direct the effort.68 The Beijing Municipal PublicSecurity Bureau was placed under the authority of the Beijing GarrisonCommand, which formed a military control committee to handle publicorder in the capital.69 This was a decisive shift in the capital's politics:military and security forces would now play a central role.InearlyFebruaryXieFuzhi ordered red guards towithdrawfrom powerseizure committees and form a preparatory committee for the Capital RedGuard Congress. The new plan was to form separate assemblies of rebelsfrom universities, high schools, factories, and rural communes. Only aftenthe various rebel groups were consolidated would the Beijing Revolution-ary Committee be formed.70 The process would be coordinated from above216

Students would not form the new powerstructures by themselves.71 For this to succeed, it was still necessary tounifythestudentrebels.TheleadersofGeologyEastIsRedwerestronglyopposed toNie and argued vociferously against her taking the leading rolein the Red Guard Congress. Their stance was unchanged by the purge oftheir original leader, Zhu Chengzhao.72 One important reason for this atti-tude was that Nie's opponents, Beida Jinggangshan, had joined the ThirdHeadquarters, while Nie's own organizations had stayed aloof. Qinghua'sKuai Dafu, who eventually became a firm supporter of Nie, was initiallysympathetic toward her opponents.73InlateJanuarytheCCRGdecidedtosquelchthewaveofoppositiontoNie. It acknowledged Nie's errors and repeatedly counseled her to correctthem, but she remained politically indispensable as the reputed author ofthe famous wall poster that had launched campus rebellions. After hearingcomplaints about Niefrom her erstwhile comrades,KangSheng reportedlycalled them together and said, “This Nie Yuanzi person is not so great. I al-readyknew this inYan'an.Butnow,even if she is abastard and an s.o.b.[huaidan, wangbadan], we still have to support her."74 On January 22Jiang Qing, speaking to a large group of rebel leaders, said, “Some peoplehave slandered Nie Yuanzi in the past, but even though she has shortcom-ings and has committed errors, our overall direction is the same."75 To sta-bilize Nie's position, the CCRG affirmed that her opponents were indeedcounterrevolutionaries, despite the fact that they were actually ThirdHeadquarters rebels. Wang Li prepared a new People's Daily editorial tocall for a “class analysis” of splits in the student movement, and in hiscomments to editors at the newspaper he lumped Nie's rebel opponents,the members of Beida Jinggangshan, together with the recently suppresseddissident red guards on the campus.76 In response to instructions from theCCRG, Beida Jinggangshan was denounced and expelled from the ThirdHeadquarters on January 21.77Nie's aggressive response to her critics at Beida was rooted in deep inse-curities about her backing from above. Her memoirs reveal that she knewthat Kang Sheng's support was grudging. In fact, Kang had targeted herHenan party group during the Yan'an rectification movement of 1943, andshe had barely survived the ordeal.78 In his own memoirs,Wang Li ex-plainedthatKangShengdetestedNieandpreferredherPhilosophyDepart-ment colleague Yang Keming, who had split with Nie in October 1966.79Nie was convinced that the strong opposition she faced from other redguard leaders was supported behind the scenes by Qi Benyu and his RedFlag colleagues on the CCRG, with whom she had clashed over the power

HeavenandEarth:RebelsDividedThis forced attempt at unity was doomed from the start.The same daythe Red Guard Congress was established,the Third Headquarters de-nounced Kuai Dafu's tabloid, Jinggangshan, for attacking Kuai's oppo-nents as “Trotskyites” and for portraying them—members of the ThirdHeadquarters—as supporters of the bourgeois reactionary line.87 Maoistofficials were keenly aware of the problem. In a March 4 meeting withthe leaders of the Red Guard Congress, Xie Fuzhi and Qi Benyu pleadedwith the students to cease theirfactionalinfighting;otherwise the neworganization would be nothing but an “empty shell."88The students ignored these pleas. Standoffs at various locations persistedand finally erupted on April 8 in a major battle at the Nationalities Mu-seum. One faction had seized power at the museum in January, and shortlyafterward a second rebel group had ousted it. The first faction, refusing togive up, allied itself with Nie Yuanzi's New Beida Commune and nineteenother rebel groups.Reinforced by its allies, it returned to the museum onApril 5 to hold a mass meeting, only to have it broken up by its rivals, whomobilized allies from Geology East Is Red, Normal University Jinggang-shan, and other groups. On April 8 the two sides brought in reinforce-ments, and in the ensuing melee hundreds of students were wounded, tenseriously.89Geology East Is Red and Normal University Jinggangshan mobilizedsuperior forces and won the skirmish.

JiangQing criticized Geology East Is Red for its invasion of the Beida campus,and Nie Yuanzi for wall posters calling Minister of Public Security XieFuzhi a “double-dealer."97 Cross-campus alliances strengthened as simi-lar battles broke out on other campuses in the first half of April.98At first, Qinghua Jinggangshan and Aeronautics Red Flag did notopenly side with Nie Yuanzi's New Beida Commune. In published procla-mations about the Beida clashes they simply stated that they supported de-mands that the two sides disengage and solve their differences throughdiscussions in the Red Guard Congress.99 By mid-May, however, both ofthese rebel groups openly sided with Nie. The three organizations held aseries of meetings along with representatives from a dozen other schoolsto analyze the causes of the new splits and decided that they were causedby two rebels in the Philosophy and Social Science Division of the Chi-neseAcademyofSciences,Pan Zinian andWuChuanqi.Theaccusationseemsfar-fetched,butthetwohadsupportedtheother sideinthein-fighting over power seizures at the Ministry of Higher Education andBeijing Daily in January.

FactionsRebornwith existing intrabureaucratic factions, which in turn led each side tomobilize allies on other campuses to help them. The deep-seated splits onthe largest campuses, Beida and Qinghua, provided large and powerful al-lies for opposing sides in these rivalries and ensured that neither side couldoverwhelm the other. Survival required off-campus allies, and alliancesgrew to create a citywide political gridlock, an interlocking puzzle of rival-ries and alliances that was impervious to the pleas of the CCRG and the in-creasingly activemilitary officials.

ENDGAME

FightingNottoLoseThe rising involvement of military and security forces signaled that thecapital's student movement had outlived its usefulness. The deepeningsplit between the Heaven and Earth factions turned the red guards intoa political liability. Despite the failure to forge unity through the RedGuard Congress, the authorities nonetheless moved ahead with plans toestablish the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.When it was finally es-tablishedonApril 20,1967,ithadbeen more thanfourmonths since thefirst such regional government had been certified, and five provinces al-readyhad done so.1Establishing a revolutionary committee signaled that the end of the massmovement was near. In order to be certified by the central government, arevolutionary committee had to have representatives of three differentconstituencies: army offcers, civilian officials considered “revolutionarycadres,” and leaders of red guard and other mass organizations.2 OnceMao and the CCRG certified a revolutionary committee,it was free to usemilitary and security forces against challengers. In the prior phase of theCultural Revolution it had been open season on party officials—almost noone was off limits. Once the central authorities approved a revolutionarycommittee,it represented Mao's“proletarian headquarters.”Oppositionwascounterrevolution.This drastic shift could be very confusing outside Beijing, where local at-tempts to seize power created factional divisions just as deep as in Beijing.Unlike Beijing, the splits in the regions were genuine contests over politicalpower. Local red guards had to decide whether to support a local revolu-tionary committee or to denounce it as a “fake power seizure." The longerthecentral authoritiestooktodecidewhethertosanctionapowerseizure,the longer the factional fighting lasted, and the deeper the divisions.3

Endgame224

This did not occur inBeijing,where there was never a serious contestfor control of the capital or the central government. Mao and the CCRGwere in control of the entire process. The campaign against the dissidentred guards made very clear which students had CCRG support. After theinitial confusion, preparations for Beijing's power seizure were given toMinister of Public Security Xie Fuzhi and the commander of the BeijingGarrison, Fu Chongbi. The CCRG told red guards repeatedly that thiswasMao'splanforthecapital.Thesplitsinthestudentmovementwerenotaboutthisplan.There could be no question of the authority of XieFuzhi,who waschosen to head the Beijing Revolutionary Committee. Xie, minister ofpublic security since 1959, had worked closely with the CCRG. In Au-gust 1966he was promoted to alternate membership in thePolitburo,andinMarch1967hewasaddedtotheStandingCommitteeoftheCCPMilitary Affairs Commission.4 Fu Chongbi, commander of the BeijingGarrison,was one of four revolutionary committee vice-chairmen.5 Thecapital's new government represented an impressive concentration of re-pressivepower.The Beijing Revolutionary Committee never faced an organized chal-lenge. Its problems were internal: student factionalism was imported intothe committee.NieYuanzi was one of the revolutionary committee's fourvice-chairmen. Her appointment was a foregone conclusion after she be-came head of theRed Guard Congress inMarch.It was already apparentthat one wing of the rebel movement strongly opposed her, and herCCRGsponsorsalreadyhaddoubtsaboutherpoliticalskills.Bythetimethe Beijing Revolutionary Committee was established,however, the situ-ation had worsened rather than improved. Violent clashes had alreadyoccurred, and the two rival rebel alliances were almost fully formed. Itwas nonetheless necessary to have a“mass representative” in the municipalleadership, and Nie fit the bill. Two of Nie's red guard allies, Kuai Dafu ofQinghua and Han Aijing of the Aeronautics Institute,were among thetwentypeople appointedtothestandingcommittee.Nie'smostoutspokenopponents, however, also had seats in the new power structure: Tan Houlanof Normal University was on the standing committee, and Wang Dabin ofthe Geology Institute joined her after a brief delay.6 The infighting betweentheHeavenandEarthfactionsbroughtdiscordintotheneworgansofpower and createdfrictions amongitsleaders and occasional challenges toXieFuzhi.

CampusRevolutionaryCommitteesThe Beijing Revolutionary Committee was intended to help unify the stu-dent movement,but in fact it had the opposite effect. This was just thefirst stepin creating a new municipal government.Once the city's powerstructure was settled, parallel committees were to be created in organiza-tions throughout the city, including universities. For red guards, this cre-ated an urgent need to push for the upper hand in school power struggles.Factional conflict intensified as each side sought to improve its position be-fore the final political settlement. This was the primary reason that rebelfactions recruited off-campus allies and formed cross-campus alliances-allies were necessary to prevent defeat at the hands of one's rivals. Signalsthatthemovementwouldsoonendintensifiedfactionalism andspurredtheformationoflargealliances.The central axis of contention was at Beida and Qinghua. Both NieYuanzi and Kuai Dafu now occupied prominent posts in the new city gov-ernment,buttheyhadbothalienatedalargepartoftheirownschoolsrebel movements. Their growing dispute with Earth-faction rebelsstrengthened their internal opponents by providing them with powerful al-lies. These allies, moreover, were often free to take the offensive againsttheir opponents because they were unchallenged on their own campuses.Nie Yuanzi and Kuai Dafu were forced to play defense throughout the Cul-tural Revolution, but their key Earth-faction opponents were not.The most powerful and aggressive of these opponents was GeologyEast Is Red.This rebel group had pioneered the attacks on central min-istriesinSeptember 1966 and had coordinated thefounding of theThirdHeadquarters. It was unchallenged on its own campus after the defeat ofthe majority faction in 1966. The Geology Institute was one of the firstto establish a revolutionary committee—on April 3, even before the mu-nicipal government, with Wang Dabin as chairman.7 Beijing NormalUniversity was the third school to establish a revolutionary committee.Jinggangshan Commune,led by TanHoulan,had dominated the school'srebelmovementformonths.TanwasnowontheStandingCommitteeof the Beijing Revolutionary Committee and became the head of the Bei-jing Normal Revolutionary Committee on April 29.8 Her group wasfree to assist Earth-faction allies on other campuses without needing todefend its home turf.

Progress in completing campus “great alliances"” was very slow.Only three more universities established revolutionary committees in lateMay,three in June, and two in July.By this time the split betweenHeavenand Earth was complete, and further progress ground to a halt. Only twomore universities established revolutionary committees during 1967, andthey were small institutions of marginal political importance.10 Only four-teen universities had established a “great alliance,” and some of these rev-olutionary committees fell apart after theHeaven-Earth split.The most glaring failures were Beida and Qinghua. Neither Nie Yuanzinor Kuai Dafu was ever able to establish revolutionary committees. Niewas now one of five top officials in the city, but she was constantly fendingoff vigorous challenges from campus opponents and their allies. Her in-ability to unifyBeidawas an embarrassment for her and theBeijing RevolutionaryCommittee.KuaiDafuwassimilarlyfrustrated.ClearlyChina'smostprominent studentleader,he could not even command theundividedsupport of rebels in his own school.Kuai's political frustrations began inMay, when he formed a preparatory group to establish Qinghua’s revolu-tionary committee.11Shortly after several other institutions established rev-olutionary committees, Kuai pushed to complete the process at Qinghua.12Zhou Enlai and other central officials were invited to a rally to celebrateon May 30. The day before, however, several anti-Kuai groups formed alarge new anti-Kuai alliancewith a confidentproclamation ina newrebelnewspaper. In response, Zhou Enlai canceled his appearance at the lastminute, leaving unresolved the question of the Qinghua revolutionarycommittee.13

RebuildingAuthority:TheCadreQuestionThe campaign to establish revolutionary committees signaled another sud-den shift—almost a U-turn—in red guard politics. To reestablish schoolpower structures, one needed administrators certified as “revolutionarycadres.”Up to this point cadres had primarilybeen targets of attack,butnow this changed. The shift in political line was foreshadowed on March 1by a Red Flag editorial that called for a more balanced evaluation of

FightingNottoLosecadres’ past errors and for accepting many of them back into the fold.14 Amore emphatic statement was an article and editorial in the pivotal RedFlag issue of March 30.An“investigation report" described how theQinghua work team had attacked the vast majority of cadres at the school,and indeed the entire party organization, as “thoroughly rotten."15 The"bourgeois reactionary line,” formerly denounced only for suppressing stu-dent rebels, was now reinterpreted to emphasize the sufferings of cadres.At one stroke, cadres were transformed from targets of the rebels to fellowvictims of the “bourgeois reactionary line."16 This added yet another twistintheconvolutedpoliticallogicoftheCulturalRevolution.Rebelswhoresisted restoring cadres to their posts could now be accused of followingthe“bourgeoisreactionaryline."This article marked an important shift in university politics:cadresnow became potential targets for recruitment by red guard factions hoping to establish a revolutionary committee. In schools where the rebelswereunited—the GeologyInstitute,the AeronauticsInstitute,andBei-jing Normal University—this was not a contentious process. One factionvetted the school's cadres and judged their political reliability. But inschools where tworebelfactions faced off,the process was extremelycontentiousintwoways.First,thetworebelgroupscompetedtoattractcadres totheir side.Second,when a cadre joined onefaction,he or sheimmediately became a target for repudiation by the other. Each side hadpowerfulincentives to denounce the cadres pledged to the other side,andthis forced each faction to defend the cadres pledged to it.The“cadrequestion” became part of intensified competition between opposingrebel groups. On divided campuses the attempt to ease the plight ofcadres ironically intensified the attacks on them.This shift had another important implication. For the first time since thework-team period the question of the status quo ante and individuals’po-sitionsinitcametothefore.Asredguardsevaluatedthecadres’pastbehavior,theyhad to consider broader questions.What was the nature of theprevious power structures? Were they fundamentally corrupt, riddled withunsuitable officials, or were there only a small handful of miscreants whodeserved tobe purged?If cadres had committed errors,how serious werethey, and how thoroughly would they need to be reformed? What abouttheir loyal followers in the past, the rank-and-file party members and stu-dent cadres whohad done their bidding?Should they be vetted as well?These issues potentiallyactivated status-based conflicts that to thispoint in the Beijing movement had played at most a secondary role. The228

Endgamecadre question raised issues about the status quo that had clear implicationsfortheinterestsofallwhohadformerlyheldfavoredpositionswithin it—not just cadres but all rank-and-file party members, studentcadres,andpoliticalactivists.Fromthebeginning,theminorityfactionand the rebel movement that grew from it were led by rank-and-file partymembers and student cadreswhohad inadvertentlyfound themselves onthe wrong side of the work teams and who had suffered severe status re-versals as a result.Their outrage at the work teams and their invasions ofministry offices in search of “black materials” illustrated their overridinginterest in restoring their status and preserving their future security andcareers.But rebel factions were not internally uniform; they also re-cruitedlarge numbers of individualswhohadnofavored position in thestatus quo ante and no real vested interests in preserving it. This raisedan intriguing possibility: would rebel groups now articulate different positions on the status quoante,withmoremoderatestances on thecadrequestion being articulated by former party members and student cadres,andmoreradicalstancesbeingarticulatedbythosewithweakerinterestsin restoring what had existed before? In the end, did the Heaven-Earthsplitembodyunderlyingstatus conflicts?Status-based conflicts were activated on college campuses only undercertain conditions.In schools that were dominated by one unifiedrebelgroup, factions did not articulate different views on the issue. On cam-puses where the rebel movement was divided,however, it was more likelythat status conflicts might come to the fore.At Beida these divisionsnever appeared.Both NieYuanzi and her opponents declared their firmallegiancetothenewlineonthecadrequestionandcompetedtoattractformer cadrestotheir side.Theirpositionson theformerBeidapowerstructure were indistinguishable.At Qinghua,by contrast,status-basedconflicts were activated in a highly visible way. Kuai Dafu reacted verynegativelytotheRedFlageditorialthatcalledfortherehabilitationof“revolutionary cadres.” His opponents, long searching for a way to gainthe upper hand, jumped at the chance to portray Kuai as out of step withthe CCRG and opportunistically adopted the cadre question as theirdefiningcause.

Beida:CompetitiveRecruitment,MutualRecriminationEarly in1967 NieYuanzi beganrebuildingBeida's administration in an-ticipation of her assumption of permanent political power. In March she

FightingNottoLoseheld meetings where cadres were asked to declare their support for therevolutionbypledgingloyaltytoNie'sCulturalRevolutioncommittee.Atthe end of March two prominent members of the former Beida PartyStanding Committee,Cui Xiongkun and Vice-President Zhou Peiyuan,pledgedsupport.17Inthecontextofthenewline articulatedthatmonthinthe pages of Red Flag, this touched off competition between Nie and heropponentstoattractcadrestotheirside.Tounderstandwhyfactionalconflict overthe cadreissue atBeidaun-folded the way it did,we should recall that the Beida factions representedrival wings of a movement against the old partyleadership that origi-nated within the party apparatus itself. They did not offer rival programsor articulate different stances on the status quo ante. They disagreed vehementlyaboutactionstakenbyNieYuanziassheconsolidatedpowerovertheredguardsandtheCulturalRevolutioncommittee,butneithersidehad aninterestindefining the cadrequestion differently.Niewas thefirst to offer cadres the opportunity to liberate themselves by pledging sup-port to her side. Her opponents simply competed to recruit cadres to Jinggangshan on equally generous terms.For cadres the primary considera-tion was to anticipate which side had a better chance of prevailing. Thischoice was crucial because as soon as a cadre pledged support to one side.he or she waslauded as“revolutionary”by that side andimmediatelydenounced as“reactionary” by the other side.Nie charged that her opponents were “old conservatives"who weretrying to “reverse verdicts,"18 but this rhetoric was tendentious and mis-leading.Both sides actively courted former cadres.Nie started the pro-cess in March by encouraging “revolutionary” cadres to “take a stand"for her Cultural Revolution committee. The opposition took the upperhand in mid-1967,whenNie's position appeared tobe weakening.ZhouPeiyuan switched sides and signed a public declaration of support for theopposition alongwith133other cadres.19The similarity of each side's stance is seen vividly in the cases of Ge Huaand Cui Xiongkun, two members of the old Beida Party Standing Com-mitteewhosidedwithNieYuanziintheinitialcontroversycreatedbythefamouswallposter.CuiXiongkunsidedwithNieinMarch1967andwasput in charge of the school's campaign against the old party committee.20At the end of November he became vice-head of a group preparing to re-store Beida's party organization.21 Ge Hua, on the other hand, declared forthe opposition and was celebrated by it as a “revolutionary cadre,” as wereNie's old leftist comrades Kong Fan and Yang Keming.22 In early October

Endgame230

Nie's faction issued a call to “drag out" Ge Hua and demanded that Jinggangshan surrender him for struggle sessions. On October 9 it staged amass rally to denounce him as the “black hand" behind the opposition.23Nie's forces continued their accusations against Ge Hua, and on December3 they captured him for interrogations and struggle sessions.24 In retalia-tion, Jinggangshan captured Cui Xiongkun on December 30, 1967, andstaged a mass struggle session against him as one of the primary architectsoftheoldBeida.Nie'sforcesheldanothermassstrugglesessionagainstGe Hua on January 10, 1968.25The two sides also adopted identical positions on the restoration of theparty organization, which had lain dormant since mid-1966. In Novem-ber1967Nieannouncedplanstovetthequalificationsofpartymembersand restore the Beida party organization.26 Jinggangshan did not objectbut complained about its exclusion from the process. There were manyprominent party members in the opposition, and by excluding them Niehad “usurped the Beida party organization."27 In the absence of substan-tivedifferencesbetween the twofactions on the“cadre question,”statuspolitics never developed at Beida.

Qinghua:Doctrinal DivergenceQinghua was a different story, but not because of preexisting differ-ences in the composition of the two factions.The doctrinal divergencebetween the two factions was due to yet another strategic blunder byKuai Dafu that provided an opening for his opponents. In mid-MarchKuai, still confident of victory, announced plans to rebuild department-level power structures. The opposition saw this as a continuation of hiscampaign against “Trotskyites” and an effort to place his own peoplein power. In late March 1967, when Lin Jie came to Qinghua to discusstheproposed contentof theforthcomingRedFlag articleabout theQinghua work team and the cadre question, Kuai's group opposedthe interpretation,but Lin published the articles without significantchanges.28Kuai's group felt that the new line on cadres hurt its cause at Qinghua.Instead of embracing the new political line, as did Nie Yuanzi,his supporters openly challengedRed Flag. They alleged that it had not said any-thing about the severity of cadres’errors and had failed to praise thestudents’attacks on cadres. They charged that the article prepared for therestoration of capitalism at Qinghua.29 Kuai's newspaper claimed that

231

FightingNottoLoseQinghua'scadreshadbeenmoredeeplyinfectedbytherevisionistlineunder Jiang Nanxiang than cadres in other schools.30Kuai's reaction handed his opponents an opportunity to embrace thenew CCRG policy,show their allegiance toRed Flag,and attack Kuaifor opposing the CCRG. The anti-Kuai forces had not previously raisedthe cadre question. As Shen Ruhuai, emerging leader of the growing anti-Kuai alliance, later wrote,Beforethis,thecadrequestionwasnot something that[we]hademphasizedvery much ... I certainly never realized the importance of the cadre ques-tion. Our attention was focused entirely on the issue of opposition to KuaiDafu's red guards taking power. Now, in looking back and rereading theeditorials in Red Flag...Iexperienced a sudden realization... In the pastwehad opposedpoliticalpowerbyKuai Dafu's red guards,butwehad neverproposed an alternative solution. Now we suddenly realized that the final an-swer to the Qinghua problem was a three-in-one revolutionary committeeunder militaryleadership.Thiswas bestway tosupplantpoliticalcontrol byKuaiDafu'sred guards.31At this point Kuai Dafu was riding high. He had finally gained Mao'sapproval tohold a massive struggle session at Qinghua on April10 againstWangGuangmei.32Leaders of theloose anti-Kuai alliance,worried aboutKuai's growing influence, concluded that they should push for a revolu-tionary committee that included large numbers of liberated cadres as a wayto prevent a dictatorship by Kuai. “The essay by the Red Flag commenta-tor had given us an excellent opportunity. We had to seize this opportunity,establishaneworganization,raisehighthebannerofthoroughlycriticizingthebourgeoisreactionarylineon thecadrequestion,andstruggletorealize a revolutionary triple alliance at Qinghua."33The opposition held a mass meeting on April 14 and founded the Jing-gangshan Regiment April 14 Column. The group was referred to simplyas“April 14,”commonly rendered as“414.”At its founding rally it crit-icized Kuai for adhering to the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadrequestion and exercising a dictatorship over the masses.34 Some 700indi-viduals attended the founding rally, representing more than 200 smallfighting groups. This was the first time that the anti-Kuai forces had statedtheir opposition as a matter of political principle: Kuai was a “fake leftist,”"and cadres urgently needed to be liberated.35This strategic calculation was what led Kuai's opponents to emphasizetheliberationofcadres-notaninherentinterestinrestoringthestatus232

Endgamequo ante. But taking this public position brought a train of consequences.First,Kuai'sgroupfeltcompelledtodefenditspositionanddenounceitsopponents as an “illegal organization” that was engaged in a “counterrev-olutionary attempt at capitalist restoration.” This led it into increasinglyharsh assessments of the cadres and the party organization at Qinghua.36This in turn led 414 to hammer more insistently in favor of the broad “lib-eration”of Qinghua cadres—and adherence to current CCRG policy.37Asit did so, cadres and party members were increasingly attracted to the morecongenialoppositionbanner,whichappearedtospeakdirectlytotheirinterests.Strategiccalculationsbytheanti-Kuai allianceevolvedintoaformofstatus-grouppolitics.The consequences of these differing stances were soon reflected inmembership profiles. On April 20,150 cadres issued an open letter de-claring their support for 414's founding declaration. Others followedsuit, and the total soon reached 331.38 Kuai's group charged that thedocument was a signal for Qinghua's cadres to overturn the verdictsagainst them.39 Kuai's supporters conducted surveys to gauge the size andcomposition of the two factions’ support.Their data provide a windowonsocial status and politicalorientation at this stagein thefactionalstruggle. The 414 alliance grew rapidly. Of the 8,423 individuals in thedepartments covered by the survey, almost half, 4,065, were members of414. Of 1,631 party members and former student cadres surveyed, 63percent claimed membership in 414, and only 27 percent in Kuai's Jinggangshan.Of those who had earlier affiliated with the old majority fac-tion before its demise, 68 percent joined 414 and only 20 percent Kuai'sJinggangshan.On the other hand,60 percent of those whohad opposedformer Party Secretary Jiang Nanxiang before the arrival of the workteam and 66percent of thosewhohad opposed the work team remainedin Kuai's faction (against, respectively, only 32 and 30 percent whojoined 414). Party members preferred 414 to Kuai's Jinggangshan by amargin of 47to30percent.40Kuai's faction, which had collected the figures, used them to argue that414 was attempting “capitalist restoration” at Qinghua. In its defense 414did not repudiate the figures; it responded that it was simply trying to"correct the errors of the bourgeois reactionary line on the cadre question"inaccordwiththeRedFlageditorialandthenewemphasisofCCRGpol-icy.41 Of course, it was the strong contrast between the positions of thetwofactionsonthecadrequestionthatattractedsomanycadres,partymembers, and student cadres to 414. These groups had borne the brunt of

233

FightingNottoLosetheworkteam's assault,and414offeredtoreversetheverdictsandremovethe taint of guilt by association that still dogged party members and stu-dentcadres.Kuai's group had no objection to cadres who chose to affiliate with it,however.42A number of them wrote wall posters repudiating 414.Mostnotable was a group of nine former members of the Qinghua Youth LeagueCommittee.43 Jinggangshan appointed two high-level Qinghua cadres toan“advisory group"; one was a member of the university's party commit-tee, and the other was general party secretary of a department.They wereput in charge of vetting cadres for a new revolutionary committee.44Kuai was not opposed to liberating cadres; he just wanted to controlthe process himself. Unfortunately, he permitted his opponents to posi-tionthemselveson thecadrequestioninawaythatwasmuchmorecon-genial to cadres, party members, and former student cadres. He also per-mitted the opposition to claim that it was now in line with CCRG policy.while Kuai was out of step. Whenever cadres or party members declaredsupport for 414,they immediately became unacceptable toKuai andJinggangshan. This began a process that pushed cadres and party mem-bers toward 414 and away from Jinggangshan.At the end of May, 414 made the split official and permanent. It changedits name from “Column” to “Headquarters,” appointed leaders, and beganpublishing a separate newspaper, Jinggangshan News.45 It was no longermerely a critic of Kuai's line on the cadre question; it was now a rival or-ganizer of a revolutionary committee. The 414 faction flourished; by theend of June it had close to 7,0o0 members.46 It eventually developed acoherent argument that expressed a more generous assessment of theprior seventeen-year history of the People's Republic and of Qinghua'sparty organization. With good reason scholars consider 414 a prototypical“moderate” red guard organization.47 Its stance, however, was as much acause as a consequence of its distinctivemembershipprofile.

However, the entireanalysis makes clear that the primary issuewasNieYuanzi'seffort toprevent Third Headquarters rebels from taking their rightful place in theleadership core of the Red Guard Congress. The article makes no men-tion of the doctrinal issues articulated with such clarity at Qinghua.49After the Beijing Revolutionary Committee was founded,Xie Fuzhiand officers of the Beijing Garrison intervened repeatedly at Beida andQinghua, as did members of the CCRG. However, the interventions usu-ally backfired, and officials frequently expressed frustrations with stub-bornrebelleaders.For theirpart,rebelscomplained aboutinterventionsunfavorable to them and openly questioned orders and the individualswho issued them. Far from the unified and disciplined instrument of pro-letarian dictatorship apparently intended by Mao and the CCRG, theBeijing Revolutionary Committee was consumed by factional rivalriesandunendingarguments.

TheBeidaTroublesTheHeaven-EarthsplitrekindledtheBeidaoppositionbyprovidingitwith strong external allies. In early March 1967, as Nie pushed a cam-paign to enforce loyalty to her organization, new splits appeared on theBeidaCulturalRevolutionCommittee.APhilosophyDepartmentinstruc-tor put up a wall poster criticizing Nie for her dictatorial behavior, andtwo standing committee members sided with him. In late May and earlyJune four new anti-Nie alliances appeared.50 Moreover, there were signsthat CCRG support for Nie might be weakening.After new splits on theschool'sstandingcommitteeinlateMarch,ChenBodaandQiBenyuwentto Beida and called for a more conciliatory approach. Chen Boda report-edly said, “You cannot just casually say that to oppose you is counterrevo-lution."51After Chen and Qi left Beida, Nie challenged them in a handbillthat duplicated Chen's talk, ineptly ensuring that opponents would be en-couraged by it, and she held meetings to criticize what she called a“newblackline."52After the violent April disturbances at Beida, Jiang Qing called for NieYuanzitomakeaself-criticismforher roleinthe conflict andfor resist-ing Xie Fuzhi's attempts to mediate.53 Nie's clashes behind the scenes

Zhou Peiyuan and133 others charged Nie with errors of line and praised her opponents.59Too late to undo the damage, Chen Boda issued a statement on July 10explaining that he still supported Nie. Stung by the losses, Nie went backon the attack, accusing her opponents of “creating public opinion for aplot to seize power” from her “proletarian headquarters."60Theeliteinterventionhadinadvertentlyhardenedthedivisions.OnAugust 17 anti-Nie groups formed New Beida Jinggangshan, and it was ad-mitted totheRedGuardCongress.61At amassrallytocelebrate,forty-fiverebel organizations proclaimed their support.

On September 1 Jiangcriticized Nie but argued that she should keep her posts and that her op-ponents were “bad elements.” On September 16 she went further, callingNie's opponents “old conservatives."63 Jinggangshan countered that Niewas a reactionary who suppressed the revolutionary masses.64 This viewwasvalidatedby rebels elsewherein thecity whoproclaimedthatNie'sopponents were revolutionary, not counterrevolutionary, as Nie hadcharged. They repudiated the January decision to expel them from theThird Headquarters before its merger into the Red Guard Congress.65 Jin-gangshan threw the accusation of harboring “old conservatives” back at236

StalemateatQinghuaXieFuzhi was no more successful in mediating the conflicts at QinghuaOn May 12 he went personally to the campus. He met first with Kuaiand Jinggangshan and afterward with the leaders of 414. Xie was unim-pressed with 414's doctrinal arguments and asserted that 414 was wrongto target Kuai and should join an alliance under his leadership. Xie wasin no mood to argue points of doctrine and quarreled loudly with ShenRuhuai.The leaders of 414 concluded thatXiehad come toQinghuasimplytohelpKuai seizepower.FurthernegotiationschairedbyXieinthe Great Hall of the People were no more successful. After Kuai and hissupporters made aggressive speeches against 414,its members concludedthat Kuai was determined to take revenge. Shen Ruhuai recalled later,"We had no choice but to take the road of a complete split."70Kuai Dafu also had critics on the CCRG. Lin Jie met with factionalleaders at Qinghua on June 9 and 14 and followed up with a phone callonJune16.Inthesetalkshepointedout thatKuaihad indeedtaken thewrong stand on the cadre question and the Red Flag editorial on the sub-ject. He pointedly criticized Kuai's response to 414—from the standpointof trying to create unity in the rebel camp, such a response was “com-pletely mistaken."” At the same time, however, Lin Jie urged 414 to joinforces with Kuai, to no effect.71 Soon afterward, on June 26, Chen Bodaand Qi Benyu visited Qinghua to try to work out an agreement. Duringcampus meetings Chen criticized Kuai's claim that 414 was attempting"bourgeois restoration.” Chen and Qi urged the two sides to merge;Kuai should stop trying to crush his opponents. Whatever trust ChenBoda may have earned from 414 during these meetings was undermined

These officials were made scape-goats for encouraging attacks on the army and for disrupting China's re-lations with foreign countries—a charge symbolized by the sacking ofthe British legation in Beijing on August 22.73 The purge undermined TanHoulan at Beijing Normal, who was closely tied to these figures,and byextension theEarthfaction as awhole.Kuai Dafuimmediatelyseized theopportunity to criticize the Earth faction for having such traitors as its"backstage bosses,” and he extended the accusation to Qinghua's 414.These figures were responsible for the Red Flag stance on the cadre ques-tion, criticized by Kuai Dafu and championed by 414 as its central cause.The leaders of 414 were thrown into a panic.74ThefallofherCCRGbackersalmostledtothedemiseofTanHoulan.A long-dormant group of rebels at her university, the Rebel Regiment,went on the offensive and pushed the criticism of Lin Jie to undermineTanHoulan.75OnSeptember 7theRebelRegiment capturedTanHoulanand subjected her to a mass struggle session.

The CCRG sent a representative tothe rally to declare its opposition to her overthrow. The CCRG, the BeijingRevolutionary Committee, and Zhou Enlai all declared their support forTanHoulan.77They demanded that the“dictatorship committee”be dis-banded and had some of its leaders arrested. This quelled the uproar andput an end to Kuai's plans for a parallel offensive to crush 414.In fact,Kuai was put unexpectedly on the defensive by the subsequent criticism ofWang Li and Guan Feng as “ultra-leftist,” a position that obviously threat-enedKuaimorethanhis414opponents.78Kuaiwassurprisedby thisdes-ignation because he had considered their stance on the cadre question toosoft.He was therefore deprived of what he saw as a perfect opportunity fi-nally to assume control of Qinghua.

Zhou didthis against the advice of 414's leadership collective, which argued that itwas politically suicidal. When Jiang Qing heard about the wall poster, shepredictably denounced Zhou Quanying in ways that threatened 414.

The leaders of 414 declared Lu a revo-lutionary cadre and permitted him to lead a mass meeting to denounce theformer party secretary. Jinggangshan objected vociferously, and on No-vember 16 it dragged him to a mass struggle session that featured him asthe sole target of abuse. Members of 414 ran to the meeting to argue withKuai's followers, and a violent confrontation ensued.87

He was held in Jinggangshan's makeshift jail for thenext eight months and was tortured repeatedly to confess to a conspiracywith 414 to undermine the Cultural Revolution at Qinghua.89This caseillustrates a generalpattern thatwehave already observed atBeida: the“liberation”of cadres intensified disputes on campuses whererebels were divided. The reasons are clear: a cadre nominated by one sideimmediatelybecameathreattotheotherfactionifheorshejoinedanewpower structure. Increasingly the disputes took the form of capturing thecadres nominated by the other side and extracting confessions throughtorture.90 By January 1968 the two sides were following the same strat-egy: Jinggangshan systematically targeted cadres pledged to 414 as rep-resentatives of the old Qinghua “black line,” and 414 returned the favorto cadres and faculty pledged to Jinggangshan.91 The two sides made vir-tually the same accusations against each other's supporters. Despite theinitially different doctrinal positions of the two sides in April 1967,thefactional politics surrounding the cadre question eventually took exactlythesameform astheydidatBeida.Hostilities deepened further in mid-December after Kuai charged thatChen Chusan, one of 414's top leaders and a member of the alliancecommittee,was a counterrevolutionary.Kuai's forces captured him on De-cember 20,beat him severely, and tortured him with burning cigarettes fonfifteen hours before he was turned over to the Public Security Bureau withfacial burns and broken ribs.

MilitaryMediationThe request by 414 to put Qinghua under martial law anticipated a city-wideeffort touse the army tohammer out agreements amongwarringfactions. By the end of January 1968 fewer than fifteen universities hadestablished revolutionary committees, and only three had done so sinceJuly 1967.96 The conflicts were worsening at Beida and Qinghua, andsomecampuseshadalreadydescendedintoastateofcivilwar.Rebelfac-tions at the Beijing Steel Institute and the Beijing Finance Institute had for-tified buildings on their campuses,had stockpiled makeshift armaments,and were fighting over territory.97To pressure factions to compromise, the army held citywide “Mao Ze-dong Thought Study Classes", attended by delegations of leaders fromeachschool.Thefirst washeld onFebruary5,1968,andwas attended bymore than 2oo leaders from some twenty universities. In the followingweeks thenumbersexpandedtosome1,40oleaders from thirty-sixschools. The original plan was to hold sessions for fifteen to twenty days,but the classes stretched onfor more than two months.Mao ThoughtPropaganda Teams staffed by military officers were also sent to some ofthe key campuses, including Beida and Qinghua, to try to mediate.98

241

FightingNottoLoseThe “study classes” had some initial success, but only at smaller schoolsthatwerenotcentraltotheHeaven-Earthsplit.Over a three-dayperiodinearly March,seven schools announced the formation of revolutionarycommittees. However, only one other school succeeded in establishing arevolutionary committee before the red guard movement was finally sup-pressed and all campuses were put under martial law five months later.99The attempt at military mediationfailed for two reasons.First,importantleaders from large campuses like Nie Yuanzi and Kuai Dafu, both of whomheld positions on the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, were not easilypressured into agreements. So long as they resisted, their allies on othercampusescoulddosoaswell.The second reason was more important. Shortly after the study classesconvened,the participants learned that Qi Benyu had been arrested forhis involvement in the Wang Li-Guan Feng-Lin Jie case.10o This led to arenewed campaign by the Heaven faction to tie the leaders of the Earthfaction to the earlier Wang Li-Guan Feng anti-party group. The first tostrike was Beijing Normal's Rebel Regiment, which had attacked TanHoulan in connection with theWang-Guan affair the previous Septem-ber. Qi Benyu had firmly supported Tan Houlan in the earlier contro-versy,and the Rebel Regiment now demanded that Qi's earlier positionontheTanHoulanquestionberetractedby theCCRG.Itsdemandwasignored, and the Rebel Regiment withdrew in protest from the studyclass on February 22. Several other members of the Heaven faction sup-portedthem.These groups held separate meetings in mid-March at which Nie Yuanzicriticizedthe studyclasses.Beforelongdisgruntledmembers of theHeavenfactionwereclaimingthattheclasseswerebiasedtowardtheEarth faction. Several groups openly challenged Xie Fuzhi and pointed outhis close ties with Qi Benyu; some of the more extreme posters at Beidaand People's University called for his overthrow and labeled him a"butcher of the revolution." Even more confusing, although Qinghua 414was not aligned with the Heaven faction, it already had grievances againstXie Fuzhi and joined in the attacks as well.101The CCRG pushed back,sending clear signals that challenges to XieFuzhi would not be tolerated. On March 21,1968,Beijing Revolution-ary Committee vice-chairmanWuDe denounced those who used criti-cisms of the study classes to attack theBeijingRevolutionary Commit-tee and Xie Fuzhi.102 Seeing an opportunity to gain the upper hand,the Earth faction strongly defended Xie Fuzhi and his revolutionary

committee and called for “dragging out" Nie Yuanzi for trying to sub-vert it.103 The Heaven faction quickly backtracked, and on March 23Nie's New Beida Commune issued a declaration of loyalty to Xie.104 Heropponents did not relent. Beida Jinggangshan and its Earth-faction alliesorganized several demonstrations at Beida to“overthrow Nie Yuanzi"for opposing Xie Fuzhi. The foray ended only after Xie Fuzhi went toBeida on March 25 and gave a speech expressing support for NieYuanzi.1o5 This halted the controversy surrounding the PLA's studyclasses, but they achieved little after this, and troops were finally with-drawn from all campuses on April 19.106

In response, Nie Yuanzi organizeda militia to“defend with force.”Three dayslater over 1,ooO members ofAgricultural UniversityEast Is Red demonstrated againstNieatBeida.Earth-faction rebels led five other organizations in a demonstration at theMunicipal Revolutionary Committee offices to demand Nie's expulsion.The next day10,0ooEarth-factionrebels again demonstrated at Beida,andbattleserupted across thecampus.XieFuzhi andWuDerushedbacktoBeidatobroadcastdemandsforthewithdrawalofoutsidersandforthetwoBeidafactionstouniteunderNieYuanzi.SeveralhundredmembersofGeology East Is Red, armed with clubs, nonetheless arrived the next morn-ing,andfurtherviolencefollowed.107On March 28 Nie ordered her forces to drive Jinggangshan out of abuilding.

Nie's forces accused the leader of

Ominously, the statement was includedin a joint declaration by the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, the Bei-jing Garrison Command, the Bureau of PublicSecurity, and the Beida Cul-tural Revolution Committee.111 Jinggangshan dug in behind defensive bar-riers. Nie Yuanzi appeared to be on the verge of complete victory. On April24 she hosted a large rally at Beida and gave a keynote speech along withthe two top commanders of the Beijing Garrison and rebel leaders fromacrossthecity.112Jinggangshan tried to hold out behind its defense works, but it was nolonger able to publish New Beida News, whose last issue appeared onMarch 22. Skirmishes broke out in April and June when its memberstried torestore utilities andfooddelivery to theirbuildings.Nie'sforcesbegan to seize and interrogate any members of Jinggangshan whom theycould capture.113 Public struggle sessions were held against captured Jing-gangshan leaders, and several captives were tortured to death.114 Near theend of April Nie and Sun Pengyi began prosecutions of opposition lead-ers. They established a central prison that held 218 cadres and faculty,where inmates were regularly beaten and tortured to confess. Compro-mise was now out of the question; ordinary members of Jinggangshanwouldbetreatedlenientlyonlyif theyturnedover theirleaders andsur-rendered.115By the end of June,Nie'sforces claimed that 1,200membersof Jinggangshan had defected and were undergoing thought reform; Niewelcomed them in a long speech.

The struggle between Kuai's Jinggangshan and Qinghua 414 hadlong since deteriorated into armed conflict. The turning point came inApril as each side attacked cadres pledged to the other side.

After Jinggangshan's angry demand forhis release was ignored, it attacked a building occupied by 414, armedwith rocks and spears, but was repelled. Jinggangshan concluded that itwas no longer possible to negotiate, and that it would have to use forcetoprevail.118To protest these attacks,414 held a protest march on April 25 andended it with a large struggle session against the captured Jinggangshancadre.The next day 414 invaded the campus homes of teachers andworkers allied with the other side, and Jinggangshan responded with anassaultononeofthebuildingsheldby414.Thistouchedoffanexodusfrom the campus as residents tried to avoid hostilities. At the end ofApril the two sides carved up the campus into two zones; Jinggangshanseized most of the buildings.119By early May the campus was a patchwork of fortified buildings and ill-defined front lines, with Jinggangshan consistently on the offensive. Ini-tially the students were armed with clubs, spears, daggers, bricks, andstones thrown from slingshots. Injuries mounted, and the first death oc-curred on April 29.On May 5 members of 414 carried the corpse of theirslain comrade in a protest march to Tiananmen Square and held a protestrally. A series of campus skirmishes followed that resulted in many casual-ties and two more deaths, with prisoners captured and brutally beaten.After one of its leaders was killed, 414 staged another protest march onMay 26, carrying his corpse to Tiananmen Square in protest.120A turning point was reached on May 30. In a large assault on a build-ing controlled by 414,the two sides used spears,knives,Molotov cocktails, gas grenades, and even a makeshift tank. In the end, Jinggangshansetthebuildingonfireandcapturedthe414fightersastheytriedtoes-cape. At the end of the eleven-hour battle, three students lay dead andmore than 300 were wounded.121 In mid-June Kuai's forces obtained ri-fles and set up snipers outside the remaining buildings controlled by 414and campus gates and began to pick off people who tried to leave or en-ter.Skirmishes continued, increasingly with grenades,firebombs,impro-vised explosive devices, and makeshift tanks.

By the end of July twelvepeople had been killed, several hundred seriously wounded, and more thanthirty permanently disabled. Most of the campus community had fled, andan estimated force of fewer than 40o die-hard fighters on both sides re-mained on campus.122At the end of July the Beijing authorities finally took action.123 On July26 officers from the elite army unit assigned to guard national leaders be-gan assembling thousands of workers from more than sixty nearby facto-ries, along with a leadership core of soldiers.124 They mobilized close to30,ooo workers to converge on Qinghua from around the city the nextmorning, armed only with books of Mao's quotations.

He suggested thatthere were“blackhands”in the topleadership whohad sent theworkers,andhe ordered his followers to resist whileherushed downtown tolodgean appeal at the Beijing Revolutionary Committee.125Kuai received no sympathy downtown,where he was told that theprop-agandateam hadbeen sent on the orders of theCentral Committee.KuairefusedtoacceptthisandquarreledviolentlywithVice-ChairmanWuDe.He returned to campus in the midst of a twelve-hour battle during whichunarmedworkersandsoldierswereassaultedastheyattemptedtoenterbuildings and persuade Kuai's fighters to disarm.

Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Jiang Qing, Xie Fuzhi, and several oth-ers.This evidently was an unusually important event.The meeting beganat 3:30 a.m. and lasted for five hours.127Edited transcripts of these rambling discussions were later issued as aprinted pamphlet.128 In them, Mao is by turns solicitous, sarcastic,threatening, and angry. The urgent meeting was obviously a reaction tothe Qinghua events, and Mao began the meeting by expressing strongdispleasure with Kuai Dafu. Kuai was late in arriving, and Mao askedwhy he was not there: was it because he could not get out, or he did notwant to come?Mao immediately made clear the reasonfor the meeting:"Kuai Dafu wants to grab the black hand, so many workers suppressingthe red guards—who is theblackhand?Nowyou cannot draghim outthe black hand is me! If he still does not come, then you grab me,comeon and grab me!" The central message, despite Mao's characteristic ram-blings, was clear: the red guard movement was over, and the universitiesweretobeputundermartiallaw.The key points of the message were issued as a “supreme directive"from Chairman Mao and in the name of the five red guard leaders.129 Maowas quoted as saying, “Now we have come to the point where you littlegenerals are committing errors. Do not get swelled heads to the pointwhere your whole body is swollen and you get edema. I do not want yousplitintoHeavenfactionandEarthfaction.Formonefactionandthatistheendofit;whatis all thisabouttwofactions?"The key mistake, Mao made clear, was the persistence of violent fac-tionalconflict:TheCulturalRevolutionhasgone onfor twoyears now!...Now theworkers,peasants,soldiers,andresidents are allunhappy,and the great majority of students are unhappy, and even some of the people who supportyour faction are unhappy. You have become divorced from the workers, di-vorced from the peasants, divorced from the army, divorced from the resi-dents, and you are divorced from the vast majority of students.Mao made very clear that his patience was at an end:I say you are divorced from the masses; the masses cannot accept civilwar...Well,now we are issuing a nationwide directive, and whoever violates it, striking at the army, sabotaging transportation, killing people, settingfires,is committing a crime.If there is a minoritywhowill not listen to

Remarkably, she contin-uedtocallfor“smashing”the“counterrevolutionary”Jinggangshanor-ganization and severe punishment of its leaders.131 Nie obviously did notanticipate that things would changedrastically when the propagandateam arrived on August 19. Her newspaper was immediately closed. Allarms were turned over, and defense works were dismantled; the propa-ganda team took control of all broadcasting equipment; all prisoners werereleased. On August 21 the propaganda team met with Nie and told her toreflectonhowherconsistentrefusaltocompromisehadcausedarmedconflicts. Her organization was disbanded on August 28, and Jinggang-shan followed suit the next day.132The leaders of both factions now submitted to reeducation in MaoThoughtStudy Classes duringwhich theywere to confess their errors.Nie Yuanzi was an unwilling student with a bad attitude. On October 15she was criticized at a mass meeting of over 3,oo0 people for resisting thepropaganda team's authority and persisting in factional attacks on herold enemies. On November 2 the propaganda team, still unhappy withher progress, recommended against her participation in the upcoming Mu-nicipal Party Congress. On November 21, still unbowed, she was subjectedto a reeducation session attended by more than 600 people, during whichshe was severely criticized for her “bourgeois standpoint” and her “decad-ent,hypocritical ways."133WhenBeida'srevolutionary committeewasfinallyestablished inSeptember 1969, a military officer became chairman, and of the six vice-chairmen,

three were soldiers and one was a worker on the propaganda team. Onlytwo vice-chairmen were from Beida: Zhou Peiyuan and Nie Yuanzi.134Nie's position at Beida was completely for show, as was her subsequent el-evationintothenationalleadership.Shewasisolatedforreeducationforover a year and was paroled briefly only for a token appearance as a dele-gate to the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969 where remarkably, despiteher political difficulties,she was named an alternate member of the CentralCommittee. In November 1969, two months after the Beida RevolutionaryCommittee was established,this“vice-chairman”and CentralCommitteemember was sent to a state farmfor labor reform.She remained under apolitical cloud until, after Mao's death, she was formally tried and impris.onedinApril1978,asthepost-Maoleadershipsettledaccountswiththe"Gang of Four”and other Cultural Revolution radicals.135Kuai Dafu did not fare any better.

10HIERARCHYANDREBELLION

ReflectionsontheRedGuardsThisbookis aboutthesocialbasis ofpolitics—therelationshipbetweensocial position and political orientation. I began with two competingconceptions: red guard factions were based on social categories definedby household labels, or they were based on social networks defined byshared ties to school power structures. My starting point reflected awidespread and largely unconscious assumption in much of political so-ciology:political orientations are derived from social position and arelargely given by existing social circumstances. For several decades schol-arship on the mass movements of China's Cultural Revolution, includingmy own, has reflected this consensus. Red guard factions, many of uswere convinced,represented differentsocial constituencies,and their po-litical orientations were derived from their social positions. Those withfavorable positions in the status quo naturally sought to defend it andadopted a conservative orientation, while those less favored in the statusquo sought to change it and adopted a more radical orientation. By im-mobilizing a well-organized and highly repressive political system,theCultural Revolution inadvertently provided an opportunity for these un-derlying interests to achieve organized expression. The struggle betweenthese interest groups spun out of control and ultimately foiled Mao'sintentions.This is a compelling story line and a highly coherent sociological ex-planation, but it actually bears little relationship to the conflicts that wehave examined in Beijing. One might be tempted to conclude that a so-cial interpretation of red guard factionalism is misplaced, but this wouldbe wrong. Instead, what I have shown is that there is much more tobuilding avalid socialinterpretationthanaccuratelycharacterizingtheinterests and identities of different groups on the eve of a major political

It is also necessary to recognize that these contexts may changerapidly and present new, ambiguous, and difficult choices. It is especiallynecessary to understand the socialinteractions that occur as these con-texts change—interactions that alter the identities and interests of indi-viduals and create new sets of allies, new grievances, and new enemies.The process of group formation and the building of collective identities isdynamicandcantakedifferentformsunderdifferentcircumstances.Ultimatelya socialinterpretationmust takeinto account theperceptionsof actors, their interactions with authority figures, and the altered reali-ties that these interactions create. In short, a social interpretation of pol-itics does not end with an accurate description of social structure.New cleavages and identities, once formed, are not fixed but continueto evolve. The rebel identity that grew out of the minority factions’ strug-gles in late 1966 broke apart into two new factional identities, Heavenand Earth, whose mutual antagonisms surprisingly lasted much longerand became much more violent than the earlier conflict with the majorityfaction. The organizational context is also very important in explainingthis new division, particularly the way in which the student rebellion waschanneled and shaped by the capital'sbureaucratic structure.The rebelassaultsonnationalministriesandcommissionsinlate1966wereeffortstofind and punish theleaders of a university's workteam.Rebels onlyassaultedtheministriesfromwhichtheirworkteamscame.Once red guards crossed into the same bureaucratic hierarchies, theyturned quickly from allies into competitors. Rebel groups from differentuniversities began to seize power back and forth from one another and en-gaged in violent confrontations over control of the same government agen-cies.These confrontations spurred alliances with rebel groups on othercampuses.After the initial confrontations of January 1967,the rebel fac-tionsfromtheGeologyInstituteandBeijingNormalmadecommoncauseand were opposed by prominent rebels from Beida, Qinghua, and theAeronauticsInstitute.Ascompetitorsbegantoinvadeoneanother'scam-puses, each side lined up allies on as many campuses as possible. Each sidehadstrongbackingwithintheCCRGOnce these new factional identities crystallized,it is puzzling that itproved impossible for them to unite. Their elite sponsors urged them todosothroughout1967and1968,andthetwocoalitionsdidnothave252

HierarchyandRebelliondifferentorientationstowardthestatusquoorarticulatedifferentprograms. Their only real difference was an unalterable opposition to eachother. Why did it prove impossible to halt their conflict short of impos-ing martial law? The primary objective of studies of political movementsis usuallyto explainhow mobilizationsbecome established—how collec-tive action begins and is maintained. Here, however, the puzzle is exitfromcollectiveaction—howtoendconflict.Once again,understanding the organized setting for politics is crucialat both the city and theuniversitylevel.At the city level the two large co-alitions achieved a rough balance of power in which neither side was ableto defeat the other.The primary reason is that the two most prominentleaders on the two largest campuses—NieYuanzi at Beida and Kuai Dafuat Qinghuawere never able to unify the rebel forces on their own cam-puses. These leaders overestimated the value of strong personal backingfrom the CCRG. By attempting to intimidate and suppress their internalcritics, they drove large sectors of their schools’rebel movements intounalterable opposition.Here theCCRG's attempts tomanipulatethe stu-dent movement by placing trusted subordinates in charge of the twolargest campuses backfired, and both Beida and Qinghua generated largeopposition movements that joined the Earth faction. Once these oppo-nents linked up with powerful allies in the Earth faction—in particular,the aggressive rebels from the Geology Institute—the two Beijing alliancesachieved a rough balance of power that prevented one side from overcom-ingtheother.Withineachuniversitythetwosidesfounditimpossibletoachievealastingcompromisebecausetherewasnoneutralthirdpartytoenforceany agreement within the schools. In a deeply flawed policy pursued un-til the middle of 1968, student factions were expected to forge their ownalliances and establish a revolutionary committee.By this point,how-ever, the mutual charges each side had directed against the other madethe prospect of defeat unthinkable. The mutual accusations of counter-revolution were much more severe than anything the work teams hadhurled at their opponents in 1966, and there was now a well-establishedhistory of physical violence between the two sides.Peace could only beobtainedif one side overwhelmed the other(unlikely solong as outsideallies could be called upon), or if a neutral third party enforced an agree-ment (as hostile martial-lawforces eventually did).Factional warfare wassohard to curtailnotbecause thetwosidesrepresentedthefundamen-tally opposing interests of different social constituencies,but because the

In the 1960s it had al-most thirty province-level political units with populations larger than mostnation-states,hundreds oflarge cities,and more than2,oo0county-leveljurisdictions.Whatbroadlessons aboutthemassinsurgenciesofthesetu-multuous two years can we possibly draw from a study focused on a dis-tinctive group concentrated in three districts of Beijing?I have argued that the divisions amongBeijing's red guards and their po-litical motives were not defined by the participants’prior social positions.Weshould not automatically expect toseethe samepattern among othersocial groups in other places.

Mixed work-team strategies intentionally divided members ofpowerstructuresagainstone another,andconservativeworkteamsinadvertently had the same impact if they permitted free criticism for a weekortwobeforedeclaring their stances.Workteams that abruptlychangedstrategy or were replaced by more militant successors had the same ef-fect. In all these circumstances the specific way political institutions col-lapsed presented ambiguous choices to those tied topower structures insituationsfraughtwithgreatpersonalrisk.Prior social positiondefined red guardfactions onlyif power struc-tureswerenotquicklyimmobilizedbyoutsideinterventions.What254

HierarchyandRebellionwould such circumstances looklike?The most obvious is an organizationwhereaworkteamwasneversent.Outsidetheeducationalandcultural sector the power structures of organizations were largely undis-turbed for many months. Initially the Cultural Revolution was not to becarried out in villages and factories,and work teams were sent tofew ofthem.Notuntillate 1966,after considerabledisagreements within theCCRG,were workerspermitted tojoin in the movement.1In urbanfactories incumbent officials remained in power and continued to holdmeetings and issue directives until the end of 1966.In these organizations party officials could devise strategies to ensure their survival andcould mobilize their followers to engage in defensive actions.2 In manyoutlying provinces officials responded to developments in Beijing byjumping on the radical bandwagon and organizing red guard units undertheirpersonaldirection.3Insuchcasesdefensivemobilizationbythosetied to power structures is to be expected.4 This occurred in many Bei-jing universities in the brief period before the work team arrived, but loyalistmobilizationusuallycollapsedafterworkteamsarrivedonthescene.Asecondcircumstancewhereloyalistmobilizationshouldoccurisunder a conservative work team that survived into late July, especiallyone that left party leaders in power to orchestrate the purge campaign.Work teams that openly tried to protect party organizations sent clearsignals to all members of power structures about expected behavior andgave little reason to anticipate that incumbent leaders would fall. Themajor surprise of the chapters on the Beijing work teams was how ex-tremely rare this stance was in Beijing after the first half of June.This second circumstance may have been much more common outsidethecapital.Beijing'spoliticsweredistinctive,perhapsunique.Itsentiremunicipal leadership was denounced and purged just as the Cultural Revo-lution began. Only several months later did similar events overtake theleaders of other cities and provinces. There were no incumbent officials inBeijing after May 1966 who could be blamed for alleged political prob-lems in the universities. The new Beijing Municipal Party Committee hadevery reason tofind and rectify all manner of alleged political errors in thecity in order to demonstrate the proper level of loyalty to Mao's vision. Inother regions, however, the choices faced by provincial, municipal, andcounty-level officials could be very different, and these officials generallyremained in power until the end of 1966. Any alleged political problems intheschools occurredunder their watch,and they couldbe threatened by

Reflections on theRedGuardsmilitant student rebellions.A conservative work team could help containthedamage.On the other hand, if student resistance was strong, regional officialsmight behave in ways similar to those of the ministry officials in Beijingwho sentwork teams into the specializedinstitutesforwhich they wereresponsible.In such cases the work teams would switch to a radical ormixed strategy in order to placate local rebels and contain the damagewithintheschool itself.Ifthis occurred,politicalcleavageswouldbegenerated that would be similar to those inBeijing.This clearly is not aquestionthat canbe answeredwithout carefully examining evidencefrom regions outside the Chinese capital.Inshort,thebroaderimplications ofmyresearchonBeijing arenotthat patterns of power and privilege had little influence on the factionalconflictsoftheCulturalRevolution,butthattheydidsoonlywhenpo-litical institutions declined gradually, permitting incumbent officials tomobilizetheirsubordinatestodefendthestatusquo.Suchcircum-stances were largely absent in Beijing.As a result, to portray conflictamong Beijing's red guards as an expression of preexisting social andpolitical cleavages would seriously misrepresent the origins of the fac-tionalconflict,theidentityoftheactivists,andtheirpoliticalmotives.Beijing shows us that short-term processes can generate severe factionalconflict and strong group loyalties even in the absence of identitiesand interests defined by a “social base” rooted in long-standing socialarrangements.These arguments apply only to the initial formation of factions. But inBeijing and other regions the initially victorious rebels eventually split intotwo new factions. In Beijing, we have seen, Heaven and Earth did notarticulatedistinct“moderate”and“radical”pointsofview,although thiswas apparentlycommoninmanyotherregions.Thisispossiblybecausethere was never any real conflict over political power in Beijing. The armedforces and security agencies were firmly in control and had the clear back-ing of Mao and the CCRG. The harsh repression campaign against dissi-dent red guards at the end of 1966 illustrated this command.In other re-gions (except Shanghai) warring mass alliances united students, cadresworkers, and even peasants who fought one another for many months andin many cases challenged the armed forces who took sides.Under these cir-cumstances massfactions often developed sharplydivergent points ofview, especially if military forces strongly favored social groups that previ-ously had been strong supporters of the status quo.256

HierarchyandRebellionWhat of thevigorous debate among high-school red guards about thequestion of class origin—a factor heavily emphasized in prior studies ofred guards? Political chauvinism among students from“revolutionary”households was certainly evident in Beijing, and the controversy aboutthe rhyming couplet was a prominent issue in the first weeks of the move-ment.But asafeature offactionalpolitics,this controversyis easytomisinterpret if it is torn from its organizational and temporal context. Itisclearthatintheelitehighschools—althoughnottheuniversities-studentsfrom“revolutionary”householdsloudlyarguedthattheyweremorequalifiedtoleadtheredguardsbyvirtueoftheirparents'contribu-tionstotherevolution.Somechildrenofhighofficialsanelitewithinthe“revolutionary” group itself—were very influential in the beginningbuttheywereaslikelytochallengethehigh-schoolworkteamsastheywere to cooperate with them,and in the pivotal cases of Qinghua andBeida high schools the most confident and outspoken challenges to theworkteamscamefromtheoffspringofnationalofficials.Crueltytowardmembers of“reactionary”households,further,wasnot restricted to students from revolutionary backgrounds.Handbillsfrom the city's neighborhoods show that studentsfrom working-classhouseholds actively denounced these same families and demanded theirexpulsion from the city. Also, the emphasis on pure class origins in polit-ical discourse was a double-edged sword. It could excuse horrific cruel-ties toward members of “reactionary”households,but it could also beused as a call to conscience and a demand for discipline and conformityto nonviolent revolutionary ideals—as the “urgent appeals”about vio-lencethatemanatedfromelitistredguardsandthesubsequentformationof the picket corps illustrate. Ironically, the red guards from revolution-ary originswhoobjectedmostpubliclyand insistentlytoviolencewerelater cynically blamed for it by CCRG functionaries in a shrill denuncia-tion campaign thathaslong distorted scholarship on the subject.The debates about class origin were indeed lively, but they occurred onlyduringabriefearlyperiod.Theyreflectedrealstatus distinctionsandgenuine cleavages in the student population, and the debate would not haveoccurred if the issue had not resonated strongly among students. But at thetime this debate occurred—late summer and early autumn of 1966—theissuedidnotdefinefactionsinBeijing.Studentsfromrevolutionaryandother“red”householdswerethemselves split over the question ofviolence.The high-school picket corps, which strongly emphasized revolutionaryheritage as a qualification for membership,sought to rein in violent

Reflectionson theRedGuardsstudentsfromallbackgrounds,especiallyredguardsfromthesamefamilyorigin as themselves.High-school factions were not clearly defined in thelate summer and early fall of 1966, largely because students from “red"households were deeply split over the issue of violence. In universities,where,by contrast,factional divisions were very clearly drawn, the issuewas almost never raised. It played no role in the minority-majority splitthat later developed into a struggle between reputed rebels and alleged con-servatives.If red guard factions did not represent the divergent interests of dis-tinct social groups, is there any reason to view them as an independentpolitical movement? In past writings about the red guards, both withinChinaandabroad,therehasbeenacleartensionbetweentwodifferentviews. Were red guards willing agents manipulated by Maoist officials,and therefore not an independent social movement but a special form of"repressive collective action"?5 Or did the red guards express indepen-dent social forces that spiraled out of the control of their elite sponsors?Early social interpretations of the red guard movement argued stronglyfor the latter: red guards did not simply carry out a suppression cam-paign in conformity with the directives of Maoist officials. They werenot a quasi-official militia of conformists who attacked alleged enemiesof the people. The split into conservative and rebel factions showed thatmuch more was involved; underlying social forces were activated thatproved impossible to control, and this is why in the end Mao was forcedtoimposemartiallaw.6In Chinese-language scholarship this has been a major point of con-tention.Some writers, consistent with the common view abroad, havedistinguishedbetween“twoCulturalRevolutions":factionaldivisionsand power struggle at the elite level and a social movement at the masslevel. The movements at the mass level, according to this view, reflectedrealsocialtensionsandoftenhadverydifferentmotivationsfromthoseof their official sponsors. The “two Cultural Revolutions” proceededalong parallel but separate tracks. One version of this argument is thatred guard conflicts reflected “social contradictions"within the Chinesepopulation that were inadvertently stimulated by elite strife.7A morepointed version is that the rebel movement expressed independent oppo-sition to oppressive political rule and widespread social injustice.8 Othersdispute this interpretation and deny that there is a useful distinction to bedrawnbetween“twoCulturalRevolutions.”PartyhistoriansinsistthattherewasonlyoneCulturalRevolution.Attheelitelevel,ultra-leftists258

Hierarchy andRebellionengagedin attacks onloyalcomrades andpropagatederroneous theoriesaboutclass struggleunder socialism.Atthemasslevel,socialconflictsexpressed this ideological confusion and the manipulations of eliteconspirators—they were notpolitical rebellions against oppressive in-stitutionsandcertainlywerenotinstancesofclass-basedconflicts.9Others argue more directly that rebels with independent aims were ac-tually very rare, and that the alleged alignment between social back-ground and political orientation claimed by overseas scholars has beenbased on obvious conceptual confusion and the exaggeration of limitedevidence.1oWere the red guards, then, an instance of “top-down” mobilization, alooseanddisorderlymilitiathatdidthebiddingofelitesponsors?Orwere they an expression of“bottom-up” social forces, a mass movementthat developed independent aims often at variance with those of its elitesponsors? In my portrayal of the Beijing red guards one can certainly findevidence consistentwithbothpoints ofview,and itistempting to con-cludethatthetruthissomewhereinbetween.Butinfactneitherinterpretation is satisfactory. The various movements among Beijing's red guardswerenotaproductoftop-downmobilization,eventhoughtheCCRGdidmanipulateanddirectstudentmilitantsinbothobviousandlessvisibleways.And even though the red guards ultimately frustrated elite attemptsat manipulation, their factional struggles did not express latent conflictsin Chinese society bred by its structure of social and political inequality.The evidence—at least for Beijing—-points to a third and entirely differentalternative.Clearlythe red guardswere subject toextensive manipulationbyCCRGpoliticians whoestablished myriad organizational ties with stu-dent leaders, met with them constantly and advised about strategy, pro-vided extensive resources, and maintained close surveillance of campusesthrough an extensive intelligence network.With rare exceptions the Bei-jing rebelswere enthusiasticfollowers of thedirectives of their CCRGsponsors, even when this involved the draconian suppression of their stu-dent rivals on obviously trumped-up political charges. When the CCRGdeemed it necessary,it did not hesitate to crush dissident red guards thatdirectlychallengeditsauthority.Despite strong elite ties and extensive manipulation,the Beijing redguards nonetheless spiraled out of control.The most obvious instance isthe brief but daring countermovement of the dissident red guards nearthe end of 1966. The dissident campaign was a full frontal assault on the

Reflections ontheRedGuardsCCRG by students who had been highly active from the beginning of theCultural Revolution, especially the high-school militants who had beencelebrated byMaohimself.These students reacted against theway theywere stigmatized as“revisionistred guards”bytheir erstwhileCCRGsponsors, and their rebellion bore a strong resemblance to the minorityfaction's earlier struggle against the work teams and the ministries thatshelteredthem.The dissident red guards were suppressed with relative ease, but theCCRG was powerless to curbfactional fighting among its loyal follow-ers in the rebel movement after January 1967.After student rebelsprovedutterlyincompetentintheir attemptstoimitate theShanghaipower seizure, they undermined efforts to stabilize new “revolutionary”organs of power in the nation's capital and became a serious politicalliability. Remarkably, the Beijing red guards played virtually no usefulroleforMaoandtheCCRGafterJanuary1967,whenthemainactionoftheCulturalRevolutionmoved to theprovinces.TheearlydecisiontoputBeijingunder thejoint control of theMinistry of PublicSecurity andthe Beijing Garrison Command signaled this reality. Although the rebelsproved difficult to control, they were by no means attempting to take themovementinadifferentdirection.Theirbattleswerenotwithauthorityfigures but with one another. They did periodically challenge individualleaders, occasionally taking shots at figures like Xie Fuzhi and Chen Boda,but they did not at any point challenge the authority of the CCRG or thenew Beijing Revolutionary Committee. This internal squabbling led even-tuallytosmall-scalecivilwarsamongrivalfollowersoftheCCRG.Itturned the rebel movement into an irrelevant and frustrating sideshow forits elite sponsors,butit by nomeans constituted a political movement thathadindependentaims.Beijing's red guard movement is perhaps best characterized as exten-sive mass participation in a tumultuous episode of bureaucratic politics.Of central importance is the fact that the factional divisions—both the1966 split between conservatives and rebels and the later rivalry betweentheHeaven andEarthwings of therebel movement—did not expressconflicts of interest between groups that had different orientations to-ward the status quo. I have shown that the primary fault lines betweenthe majority and minority factions in late 1966 were conflicts betweendiversecoalitionsofstudentsfromessentiallysimilarbackgrounds.ThedivisionbetweentheHeavenandEarthfactionswasafurthersplitwithinthe rebel movement that only occasionally—as at Qinghua University after260

HierarchyandRebellionApril 1967—spurred the articulation of different political orientations to-ward the status quo.11 But even the moderate stance of Qinghua's 414fac-tion on the cadre question and pre-Cultural Revolution power structuresoriginated in tactical opportunity rather thanbeliefs that it articulatedfromthebeginningofthemovement.The central point in my account of Beijing's red guards is that theiridentitiesandinterestswereforgedinaseriesofdramaticpoliticalinter-actions whose outcomes left participants on opposite sides of a new po-litical divide. These interactions generated new cleavages and politicalidentities and committed participants to courses of action that werehighly consequential for them personally. This analysis differs from mod-els of contentiouspolitics thatpresume that theinterests ofparticipantsare fixed bymembership insocial categories or political networks or bypreexisting moral commitments or politicalideologies.It also contrastswiththeoriesofsocialmovementsthatviewthesepriorcharacteristicsasplaying out primarily through strategic responses to political opportuni-ties or the changing availability of resources.12 The analysis developed inthis book takes context and sequences of interaction as the central mech-anisms of interest in generating political cleavages and identities. It alsoleads to the unmistakable conclusion that red guards were not fightingeither toprotect vested interests or lay claim to new rights and privileges.They were, quite simply, fighting not to lose.13 In the context of Chinesepolitics of that era, to end up on the losing side of a political strugglewould lead at best to drastically reduced career prospects and at worst toimprisonment or physicalharm.As a form of mass participation in bureaucratic politics, the Beijingredguardmovementwas indelibly stampedby thefeatures ofthe orga-nized hierarchies within which it took place.The power structures ofschools ensured that a minority of politically active students respondedto efforts to mobilize from above. The decapitation and splintering ofthese power structures by work teams divided politically active studentsagainst one another. The closed nature of the political system and of ed-ucationalandcareerladdersensuredthatthestakesforstudentswerelargeandtheconsequencesofdefeatpotentiallyirreversible.Theorgani-zational structures that linked ministries with universities strictly definedlines of attackfor rebelfactions asthey assaulted government agencies inefforts to reverse the verdicts of work teams.

The intelligence networks established by the CCRG, which reachedintocampusesandevenintoredguardfactions themselves,providedextensiveinformationaboutthedispositionofredguardgroupsandlinesof communication to steer rebel factions in one direction or anotherThe Beijing red guard movement operated within a highly organized political hierarchy that was temporarily in disarray but whose structuresstill exerted an irresistible pull on the motives and actions of the partic-ipants.On further reflection,what is most remarkable about the Beijing redguardmovement—or thevarietyof distinct submovements thatIhavedescribed—is the extent to which the various mobilizations were ulti-matelydefensiveinnature,andthattheconflictsandgrievancestheyex-pressed were generated by recent short-term processes.Theminority fac-tion's rebellion against majority domination of its campuses and itsattacks on ministries to“drag out"anddenounce work-teamleaderswere attempts to nullify the potentially devastating impact of politicalverdicts lodged against its members in June and July 1966.The majorityfaction'smobilizationinresponse totheminorityfaction'schallengewasin turn an effort to avoid being implicated in the recent political errors ofthe work teams and to prevent students openly hostile to it from takingpower. The daring movement by dissident red guards to challenge theCCRGascynicalmanipulatorswasanefforttoextricatethemselvesfromthe charge that they were not genuine rebels but willing tools of the“bourgeois reactionary line.” In this sense, the motives of these “conser-vative” dissidents were remarkably similar to those of their “rebel"enemies.Finally, the deep-seated and stubborn campus factionalism over theformation of school revolutionary committees and the citywide politicalgridlock created by theHeaven and Earth alliances resulted from the ef-fort by both sides to prevent hostile enemies from taking control of theircampuses.By late 1967 factional opponents had already shown apropensityfor violence that signaled a real prospect of physical harmshouldtheothersidewin.Withoutpowerfulthirdpartiestorestrainthewinning faction, it could act on political accusations that by the summerof 1967had already become far more extreme than those the work teamshad lodged against their opponents the previous year.

RadicalWorkTeamsThe work team arrived at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute on June 14, seizedpower,and announced that all high- and middle-level cadres would step downfrom theirposts.Over thenext threeweeks all cadres and teacherswere detainedoncampusforinvestigation andmass criticism.Allforty-six classroom coun-selors were forced to step down from their posts pending investigations. Theschool's party secretary was held in isolation and subjected to a mass strugglesession.1At theBeijingInstitute ofPolitics andLaw,the workteam arrived onJune 4and immediately deposed the school's party committee and announced that allofficialsdown to thelevelofpoliticalinstructors would step downfrom theirposts.² Three days later it held a large struggle session against three of the topschool officials,during which it declared that the entire party organization wasrevisionist:nineteen oftwenty-two division-levelcadres were declaredfollowersof a revisionist “black line,” as were forty out of fifty-four department-levelcadres. More than 300 party and youth league branch secretaries and committeemembers were forced to undergo a grueling process of confession and self-examination,and85percentof theclassroomcounselorsweredeclaredfollow-ersofthe school's“blackline."At Beijing Normal University the party secretary was denounced in wallposters on June 2 and was stripped of his post two days later,even before theworkteam arrivedonJune 6.Theworkteamimmediatelytookover theleader-ship of the school and conducted a radical purge of the entire power structure.3TheForeignMinistrydispatched awork teamtotheInstitute ofForeignRelationsrelativelylate—June17—butit acteddecisively.4Itseizedpowerfrom theparty committee and told all cadres to step down for investigation, from the topleaders down totheheadsof teaching offices,politicalinstructors and classroomcounselors,and even ordinary members of party branch committees.The work286

Work-TeamCaseHistoriesteam charged that the vast majority of cadres were“conservatives”who hadsuppressed the masses,and all party and youthleaguemembers were put undersuspicionaswell.

ConservativeWorkTeamsTheBeijing Institute of Irrigation and Hydropower work team solicited opinionsabout the party committee from cadres and students and soon found itself del-uged with denunciations and complaints. The Ministry of Hydropower had al-ready purged the school's leadership during the Socialist EducationMovementthe yearbefore and was unwilling to accept the charges.Pressured byits superi-ors in the ministry to put a lid on things, the work team argued that the partycommittee was “genuinely leftist.” This led to a wave of criticisms of both theparty committee and the work team, and the work team retaliated with a cam-paign against “fake leftists” and “anti-party elements” in which large percentagesofcadres,faculty,andstudentswere accused.The work team sent to theBeijingSports Institute was willing to conduct athorough assault on the power structure but refused to eliminate its top officials.TheStateSports Commissionsent theworkteam,headed byVice-ChairmanHuang Zhong,on June 10.6 The work team declared that it had come “tohelpthe institute's party committee carry out the Cultural Revolution” and statedthat the school's party leadership was “comparatively good." The work teamwelcomedmass criticismbutrefusedto accept serious charges against thepartysecretary and his associates. Of twelve party committee members, nine were sus-pended from their posts, and five were put in categories 3 and 4. Purges at thelower levels of the power structure were more severe,with very high percentagesclassifiedastypes3or4atthedepartmentlevel.Membersof thepartycommit-tee, general branch secretaries, and branch secretaries who denounced the partysecretary or other top officials considered reliable were soon accused by others inturn,and the workteamlabeledthem“anti-party.”

MixedStrategiesThe work team from the Ministry of Commerce arrived at the Beijing InstituteofFinance andBanking onJune10and quicklyhalted criticisms against certainschool and ministry offcials.One of the members of the school's party commit-tee, Chen Rulong,headed the work team and directed a purge campaign that re-taliated against thosein theschoolwhohadwrittenwallposters criticalofhimandhis associates.7The leaders of the Beijing Normal Institute were denounced by a number ofmiddle-ranking cadres, including general branch secretaries, in the week beforethe work team's arrival on June 1o. The party committee counterattacked,

Work-TeamCaseHistoriesmobilizingitsloyaliststochargethatits accuserswereinfactrightists andalienclass elements.8 The work team deposed the party committee and announcedthat allcadres,including studentpolitical instructors,would stand asidefor in-vestigation.” Soon it declared the party organization “completely rotten,” butsomehow the party secretary's own errors were not severe.The work team alsodecreed that three members of the party committee were genuine leftists andtookthemonasadvisors.Outofsome200cadresintheschool,138werelabeled“monsters and demons”and subjected to struggle sessions organized bythe work team,which did not permit criticism of cadres it designated genuineleftists. All cadres, including student political instructors, were made to standasideforinvestigation.FromJune24 toJuly14 theworkteam orchestrated acampaign againstrebellious cadres andtheir student supporters,levelingpoliti-cal accusations against them and compiling dossiers to document the charges.After public self-criticisms,theparty secretary and her close associates were re-storedtopower.TheChineseAcademyofSciences dispatchedaworkteamto theChineseUniversityofScienceandTechnologyonJune6.1oTheworkteamwas organizedand briefed by Yu Wen, an Academy offcial who had been the university's partysecretaryfrom1958to1963.Thiswasaconflictofinterestthatsoonbecameapparent in the work team's conduct.The work team designated Party SecretaryLiu Da as the primary target of the campaign. He was removed from all posts,andtheworkteam took over.Theworkteamdividedschoolofficialsintoan“Academy faction”and a“LiuDa faction”and declared open season on allthoseconnectedwiththelatter.Errorscommitted attheschool afterLiuDatookover in 1963 were vigorously exposed,but the work team refused to acknowl-edgethattheschool'spoliticalproblemshadbegunbeforethatdate,duringYuWen’s reign.Those who criticized members of the“Academy faction”or the ear-lierreignofYuWenwere attacked.

WorkTeamsThatReversed CourseTheEighthMinistry ofMachineBuildingsentitsworkteam totheBeijingAgriculturalMachineryInstitute onJune 4.For almosttwo weeksitdefended theparty committee against escalating attacks, and one of the vice-ministers came tothe school and accused the critics of anti-party sentiments.Criticisms nonethe-lessescalateduntil theworkteamreversedcourse onJune14,tookcontrolof theschool,deposed thepartyleadership,and made all cadres step downfrom theinposts.The work team declared that the entire party committee was revisionistand that all but a few party members were problematic, and conducted a radicalpurge.11Theworkteam arrived at theBeijingForeignLanguagesInstituteNo.2 onJune9.The schoolhadbeenestablished in 1964under theStateCouncilCommission288

Work-TeamCaseHistoriesonForeign CulturalRelations,which assigned ZhangYan,head of thePoliticalDepartment of the State Council Office of Foreign Affairs, to lead the work team.12The institute's president, Li Chang, was also a vice-chairman of the Commissionon Foreign Cultural Relations and head of its party group.13 Work-team headZhangYanhad a serious conflict of interest.His wife,Yang Chun,was a vice-chairman of theCommission onForeign Cultural Relations and could havebeendirectlyimplicatedin accusations that came out of theinstitute.14Moreover, theinstitute’s president, Li Chang, was her colleague on the commission and the headofherpartyorganization.Zhang initially tried to minimize accusations against the school's leaders, de-claringthat theyhadmadeerrorsbutcouldstill leadtheCulturalRevolutionwithassistancefromtheworkteam.Criticismsoftheinstitute'sleadersdirectlyimplicatedofficialsinthecommission,includingZhangYan'swife.Asthecriti-cisms escalated,Zhang reversed course.Ina speech onJune 14 he declared theschool's party committee “fascist.”He purged twelve of its members and seizedpower from the party committee. In the ensuing purge thirty-one of the sixty topleading cadres were targeted inpublic accusationmeetings,and more than 80percent of all the party, youth league, and political work cadres were targeted asspies and anti-party conspirators and forced to confess and name other membersof their conspiracy. They were held in isolation on campus and forced to writeself-criticisms.Morethan30percent of theyoungpoliticalinstructors were crit-icized,along with many of the student cadres in the classrooms.In mid-JulyZhangYanwassuddenlydenouncedbyChenBodaandKangShengandre-moved from allposts,and this action placed his recent verdicts on school offi-cialsindoubt.15TheMinistry ofPetroleum sentits work team to theBeijingPetroleumInsti-tute on June 4,but left the school's party committee in power and let it conductits own campaignfor almosttwoweeks.16During thisperiod thepartycommit-tee announced plans for an investigation of cadres,but it began slowly, focusingon old professors and other instructors outside the power structure.As studentsaccusedtopparty officialsofdelayingtactics,the workteamfinallystepped inon June 16 and deposed the party committee. It formed a Cultural Revolutioncommittee and divided the party leadership into“red"”and “black.” The partysecretary and one of his vice-secretaries were designated leaders of the “red” lineand helped orchestrate the purges against a “black line” allegedly headed by an-other vice-secretary. The ensuing campaign targeted roughly half of the school'sofficials:116 cadres were designated followers of the“blackline,”40 percent ofthe cadresin the school.Theworkteam alsobeatbackpolitical challenges totheofficials itprotected as“red"and lodged counteraccusations against more than240critics,labeling 194 of them“rightists."TheBeijingRailwayInstituteworkteam abruptlychanged course.After taking aninitially supportive stancetoward theparty committee,it accused selected

289

Work-TeamCaseHistoriesleaders of serious political errors.The recent history of the institute,whichhadmergedwith theHarbinRailwayInstitutein1953,17played animportantrole inthese developments.TheMinistry ofRailways sentitsfirstworkteamtothe in-stituteonJune5.i8Theworkteamwasreluctanttoacceptseriouschargesagainst the school's party committee.As accusations escalated,ministry officialsdecided to change course. The work team was reorganized, and Vice-MinisterGuoLu arrivedonJune10withanewdefinition oftheinstitute'sproblem.Guochargedthat the cadres from the oldBeijingRailwayInstitute,longunder theBeijing MunicipalParty Committee,wereinfected by the revisionism of thatbody,while those whohad beentransferredfrom the oldHarbinInstitute werenot implicated. The work team mobilized members of the institute to expose fol-lowers of the “municipal line” and to protect followers of the “ministry line."Only one of the top seven school officials was targeted for denunciation; theother sixwerefromHarbin.Below thislevel,however,the searchforfollowersof the “black line” was extensive. Ninety percent of the general branch secre-taries,vice-secretaries,andyouthleague secretariesweremadekey targets of thecampaign, and only one of eight general branch secretaries escaped the attacksAlmost allbasic-level cadres and asignificant number ofpoliticalinstructors andordinary party and youth league members were accused of following the munic-ipalfaction.

TwoWorkTeamsThefirstwork team arrived at theBeijingForeignLanguages Institute onJune7andfoundacampus alreadyfilledwithwallpostersdenouncing theparty com-mittee. However, the work team's head, a member of the party committee of theMinistryofForeignRelations,hadalreadydecidedthattheschool'sleadershadnotcommittedseriouserrors.Studentsdefiedtheworkteamwithwall-posteraccusations andstrugglesessions againstdepartmentalpartyofficials.Theworkteam attemptedtostop the attacks,but thestudents accused theworkteam of ananti-Maoconspiracy.OnJune16adelegationwenttotheCentralPartyofficesinZhongnanhai todenounce theworkteam.Itreturnedwith asigneddirectivestatingthatthefirstworkteamhadcommittederrorsandwouldbereplacedbya newworkteamledbyVice-MinisterLiuXinquan,whoarrivedthenextdayLiu immediately deposed the party committee and took control, abandoned theeffort to protect the party organization, and initially won over the opponents ofthe first work team by permitting students freely to designate targets, make ac-cusations,and hold struggle sessions.19At theBeijing ForestryInstitute the first wallposters criticalof the school'sparty committee appeared on the evening of June 1.20 The Ministry of Forestry'sfirst work team arrived onJune 2.Led byLu Qing,head of the ministry's Politi-calDepartment,it setup a CulturalRevolution committeeled byfourmembers290

Work-TeamCaseHistoriesof the party committee. The committee announced that the campaign wouldfocus on onlyonedepartment.Partysecretaries andpoliticalinstructorswarnedstudents that their names were being recorded, and prospects of party member-shipwouldbeharmediftheymadeaccusationsagainstthepartycommittee.OnJune13severalhundred studentsheldademonstrationagainsttheworkteam's conservative stance.Sensing thatthiswork team waslosing control,theministry withdrew it and sent in a second one. Led by He Renyin,vice-head oftheministry'sPoliticalDepartment,the new work team,with 150 members,took over theinstitute andforced allbasic-level cadrestostand downfrom theirposts. On the afternoon of June 14, encouraged by the first work team's retreat,more than1,oo0 students and teachersheld a mass rally onthe school's athleticfield.Theylodgedaccusations againstthepartycommitteeforattempting tosabotage the school's Cultural Revolution.A group of young party membersloudly denounced the leaders.They said that they were willing to risk their partymembershipif thiswaswhatitwould taketodefendthePartyCenter andChairmanMao.Overthenextseveraldaysstudents organizedstrugglesessionsagainstcadres,including sixmembers ofthe party standing committee.Theworkteaminitiallydidlittle tointervene,but onJune21work-teamheadHe Renyin showed up at a struggle session against a departmental cadre. He toldthe students that their actions appeared “leftist” on the surface but were actually“rightist.” Angered students pursued He Renyin as he left and forced him tostand anddebate.Thenextdaytheworkteammobilizedstudentsfor a counter-attack.Atmassmeetings onJune 23 and 25,most of the speakers criticized theopponents of the second work team and suggested that their behavior was anti-party. In early July mass struggle sessions against an“anti-party clique” expelled1 percent of the school's party members and suspended another 10 percent. Evenhigher percentages of youthleague activists suffered the same fate.At theBeijingLightIndustrialInstitute thefirstworkteam arrivedinearlyJune.Headedby ZhangWanhe,head of thePoliticalDepartment of theFirstMinistry ofLightIndustry,it declared that all instructors shouldfeel free to ex-pose one another, whether they were party members or cadres.21 However, theyrestricted all such criticism tofaculty and lower-ranking cadres; the party com-mittee wasoff limits.Any wallposter criticizinga middle-orhigh-rankingcadre had tobe clearedin advance by thework team.Over half thefaculty andlower-ranking cadres were criticizedin wall posters.Thispolicywas challengedinwallposters,and conflict escalated untilthe first workteam was withdrawnonJune14.The new work team removed the party committee from power and announcedthat all ofitsmembers would stand asideforinvestigation.Vice-PremierBoYiboaccompanied the work team to the school and declared that the campaign wouldstart with inner-party criticism and move later to “open-door” mass criticism.22Hisinstructionswerewidelyignoredbythosewhohadledoppositiontothefirst

See, for example,Andreas(2002),Lee (1975), and Tang Shaojie (1999b).14. The earliest statements of this perspective were Oksenberg (1968); Vogel(1968);and Vogel (1969),339-345.It was developed further by Lee (1975,1978）and figured prominently in many subsequent studies of different socialsettings (Blecher and White 1979,77-108;Chan1982;Chan,Rosen,and Unger1980;Hua Linshan 1996a,1996b;Rosen 1982;Unger 1982;Walder 1978,1996).15.

Kwong(1988）offers aconcise overviewofthestudentmovementnationwide.RecentChinese-language books on the red guards have either a national focus (Xu Youyu1999) or concentrate on one university(Tang Shaojie 2003).Bu Weihua’s (2008)account of nationalpoliticsfrom1966to1968devotes considerable attention toBeijing.25.See the review of new sources in Esherick,Pickowicz,and Walder (2006),6-16.26.Walder (1986).27.Walder (1996).28.Walder and Hu (2009).This figure is based on retrospective questions in asamplesurveyconductedinthemid-1990s.29.Andreas (2002,473) estimated that 7 percent of Qinghua University stu-dents were from“revolutionary”households on the eve of the Cultural Revolu-tion.30.Iexpectedtoseeaformofnetworkmobilizationsimilartothatdescribedby Gould (1991,1996) in other historical settings.31.Interviews with strategicallyplacedformer participants wereveryuseful,butthey couldnever accurately establish the timing and sequence ofevents or thespecificclaims andpolitical languageusedatthetime.Intervieweescanrecallvividanecdotes andofferinterpretationsthatinisolationseemhighly authoritative,butI have oftenfound that they are convincingly refuted by the documentary record,revealing inaccuracies,half-truths,and self-servingmyths thatwould otherwise in-trudedirectlyintothe analysis.32. Barnouin and Yu Changgen (1993), 75. Similar portrayals of work teams,not always stated so clearly and emphatically,canbe found in Harding (1991),136,142-143;Kwong (1988),20-21;Lee (1978),50-53; and Pepper (1991),544-545.Thisportrayalwas offeredbyprominentpoliticalactors atthe time,for example,Chen Boda,who later repeated his earlier denunciation of the workteams in memoirs dictated tohis son,“Theemphasis of many work teams was tocarry out criticisms of the so-called^bourgeois academic authorities,’butwithregard to the former school party committees and branches, they basically pro-tectedthem”(ChenXiaonong2005,282).33.For example,Liu Zhijian,briefly a member of theCentral Cultural Revolution Group, asserted many years later, “In general, those who originally supportedthe school party committees also supported the work teams who came to lead the'Cultural Revolution'; those who originally opposed the party committees wantedtokick aside both the schoolparty committee and the work team”(Liu Zhijian2000,32)34.This is the central point ofXu Youyu's (1999,81-83,109-115) critique oftheideathatredguardfactionsrepresentedtheinterestsofdifferentsocial296

My analysis rein-forces his argument by providing a possible explanation for those differences.5.This interpretation is emphasizedby Gong (2003).6. This interpretation is either implied or explicitly argued in a wide range ofpublications: Chan, Rosen, and Unger (1980); Lee (1975,1978); Oksenberg(1968);Perry and Li Xun (1997);Rosen (1982);Unger (1982);Vogel (1968,1969); and Walder (1978,1996).7.Tang Shaojie (1999b);Yin Hongbiao (1996,1997,1999).8.HuaLinshan (1996a,1996b).Xu Youyu (1999) cites similar arguments inessays in émigre journals by former rebels likeWangXizhe and YangXiguang.9.Jin Chunming (2002),399-426.10.Xu Youyu (1996a,1996b).11.According toXu Youyu (1999,109-121) and Tang Shaojie (1999b),themass factions that foughtfor real political power in the provinces(except Shang-hai）in 1967and 1968developed clearly distinguishable moderate and radicalorientations toward the status quo ante that were similar to the doctrinal divi-sions at Qinghua.Thereasons that these cleavages developedelsewhere,butnotin Beijing, are a major subject for future research.Xu Youyu (1999, 56-63) at-tributesBeijing's distinctivenessto theintimateinvolvement of the CCRG,thelack of activeinvolvement by organized workers and peasants,and the relativelymutedinvolvementofthearmedforces.12. Although Charles Tilly pioneered this perspective on contentious politics,his earlier analysis of the counterrevolutionaryuprising in western France in1793infact describedalocalinteractive process under ambiguous circum-stances that split members of the same social groups into two opposing camps(Tilly 1964,227-304).See the discussion in Walder(2006a,737-738).
