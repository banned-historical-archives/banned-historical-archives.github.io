# Notice from the CCP Center on the Policy concerning the Mainland Relatives of Persons who Left for Taiwan

November 1, 1979 - Zhongfa (1979) No. 80

Regarding the mainland relatives of persons who left for Taiwan, the party center had formulated specific policy, but it was severely disrupted by Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four.” This is now reiterated as follows:

The mainland relatives of persons who left for Taiwan should be treated equally, kindly, and without discrimination in political, economic and social life. Taiwan is a part of China; it cannot be said that the relatives in Taiwan are “overseas relations.”
Normal communication by letter or telephone between relatives and friends from the mainland and Taiwan should not be intercepted by anybody.
Mainland relatives of persons who left for Taiwan who have suffered from being falsely incriminated by Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four” are to without exception be rehabilitated (pingfan); those persecuted to death are to be exonerated.
Regarding the harmonious education and implementation of policy work concerning the mainland relatives of persons who left for Taiwan: ask provincial, municipal and regional party committees to first conduct propaganda and education within the party and then arrange for implementation.
