# The Center Comments on and Transmits the CCP Central Organization Department’s report regarding the reversal of the Liu Zhidan novel case

## 4 August 1979 · Zhongfa (1979) No. 53

The Center has agreed upon the content of the report regarding the reversal of the Liu Zhidan[1] novel case by the Central Organization Department. We forward this report, along with its attachments, to you. The report puts forward concrete suggestions; [we ask that] the relevant units please implement them.

CCP Central Organization Department report regarding the reversal of the Liu Zhidan novel case

Party Center:

The 1962 Beidaihe Working Conference[2] and the Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee,[3] owing to the rise of Kang Sheng, both criticized the then yet-to-be-published novel Liu Zhidan. Afterwards, the writing of this novel [being seen] as an anti-party incident spread inside the Party. The committee engaged in a long-term case investigation of the novel, the novel’s author comrade Li Jiantong,[4] and comrades Liu Jingfan[5] and Xi Zhongxun who had reviewed the draft, as well as associated comrades from within the Workers’ Publishing House who organized the writing of this novel. The case investigation had not yet been completed by the start of the “Cultural Revolution,” and so the committee did not make a formal conclusion.

During the “Cultural Revolution,” Kang Sheng, along with Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” embarked on a wider range of political persecution related to the Liu Zhidan issue. Yao Wenyuan issued articles that publicly declared Liu Zhidan as an anti-party novel, claiming that both the author and the comrades who supported the novel were anti-party elements. Following this, those comrades who had gone through case investigations suffered even more, and the number of people implicated by association grew. The leading comrades who had read drafts [of the novel] and supported its creation, [along with] some old cadres and party members who had originally been at the Shaanxi-Gansu revolutionary base area, and even some comrades who took part in the case investigation, all suffered different levels of persecution. Some became disabled or died [as a result] of [this] persecution. Comrade Li Jiantong was once described as “a backbone element of the Xi Zhongxun counter-revolutionary clique who used novels as a means of carrying out anti-party activities.” In May 1977, the Central Case Group issued an “investigation conclusion” on Comrade Liu Jingfan, maintaining that Liu had “conspired with Xi Zhongxun and pushed forward the anti-party novel Liu Zhidan in order to reverse the verdict on Gao Gang.”[6]

Following review, we believe that Liu Zhidan (the advanced manuscript sent for review) is not an anti-party novel. Rather, it is a relatively good novel that praises the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries and describes the history of revolutionary struggles. Xi Zhongxun and other comrades who were concerned with the creation of this novel, [and] who had made comments on how to improve [it], were all completely reasonable. There is entirely no ground to call it something like the activities of an anti-party conspirational clique. In consideration of the circumstances of the case, the so-called case of using the Liu Zhidan novel as a means to carry out anti-party activities is a major wrongful case contrived by Kang Sheng. During the “Cultural Revolution,” Kang Sheng, together with Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four,” went even further by creating a modern literary inquisition[7] that implicated a vast number of people. We hereby submit our “Opinions concerning the review of the Liu Zhidan novel case”; please read and review them.

Our suggestions:

1. Reverse the case on the Liu Zhidan novel. Because Yao Wenyuan [previously] issued defamatory articles in People’s Daily and Red Flag,[8] [we] ask that People’s Daily and Red Flag  publish a couple of articles on the case reversal.

2. The comrades defamed as a result of the Liu Zhidan novel case should without exception be rehabilitated.[9] The wrongful conclusions and punishments [meted out to them] should without exception be revoked. The related self-examinations and confessions should without exception be removed from the cadre dossiers and destroyed. [We] ask that relevant units earnestly carry out follow-up work.

3. Newspapers and periodicals can issue some commentaries clarifying ideology, theory, and the rights and wrongs of the party line, which were confused by Kang Sheng, Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four” in this case. [The commentaries are to] restore the traditions and work style of the Party, to better adjust Party policy on literature and the arts, to implement the guideline to let a hundred flowers bloom and let a hundred schools of thought contend, [and] to promote the prosperity of socialist literature and art.

If nothing is wrong with the above mentioned, please comment and transmit to every region.

CCP Central Organization Department

14 July 1979

Translated by Yi-ting Chen

[1] Liu Zhidan was a military commander and communist leader that had founded the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Base Area in North-West China and who later led defeats of the Nationalist army in 1934 and 1935. He died during a battle in 1936, thereby obtaining status as a martyr.

[2] This conference took place annually at Beidaihe in Hebei. Following the end of the Great Leap Forward, the 1962 conference mainly concentrated on problems relating to agriculture, finance and trade, and cities.

[3] The Tenth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee took place in Beijing from September 24-27, 1962. At the plenum Mao discussed strengthening the centralized economy and the people’s communes, as well as problems of agricultural development. The plenum prioritized agricultural development.

[4] Li Jiantong (1919-2005) was the sister-in-law of Liu Zhidan. While Li was preparing to write this novel, the Workers’ Publishing House received a request in 1954 from the CCP Publicity Department to encourage Li to praise the deeds of Liu Zhidan. The first draft of the novel was completed in 1959, and later drafts checked by Xi Zhongxun (at Li’s invitation to do so). The novel was first published in instalments in 1962 in the Guangming Daily, Workers’ Daily, and China Youth Daily. Li was a cadre prior to the Liu Zhudan novel incident; afterwards, she was expelled from the party and sent to Jiangxi province for reform through labor. She was rehabilitated in 1979.

[5] Liu Jingfan (1910-1990) was the younger brother of Liu Zhidan and the husband of Li Jiantong. He joined the CCP in 1930 and participated in the Japanese War Against Japan and the Shaanxi and Gansu Encirclement Campaign alongside his brother in 1935. He later became the deputy minister of the national geology department after the founding of the PRC. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution as a result of the novel incident. After his rehabilitation in 1978 he resumed his position within the party and became deputy minister of the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (among other positions).

[6] Gao Gang (1905-1954) was a CCP leader during the Chinese Civil War and the early years of the PRC. He was also a friend of Liu Zhidan’s; together they built the guerrilla base in northwest Shanxi in 1926. In 1953, Gao Gang’s attempt to increase his personal position within the party by displacing Liu Shaoqi and Zhou Enlai from their key positions in government – the so-called ‘Gao Gang Affair’ – resulted in Mao calling Gao’s actions out of order. Mao and others believed that Gao’s attempt risked the party’s unity. Gao committed suicide in August 1954.

[7] “Literary inquisition” (wenziyu) refers to the official persecution of intellectuals because of their writing during the time of Imperialist China. This kind of inquisition took place under each dynasty that ruled China; the Qing dynasty was particularly notorious for this practice. There are many famous poets and writers who have written about their suffering under the literary inquisitions of different dynasties.

[8] This included an article from 1963 titled “Comments on the counter-revolutionary double-dealer Zhou Yang.” The article accused Zhou Yang of having actively encouraged the publication of the anti-party novel Liu Zhidan.

[9] Here the term used in the original is zhaoxue pingfan, which refers to both living comrades and those already dead.
