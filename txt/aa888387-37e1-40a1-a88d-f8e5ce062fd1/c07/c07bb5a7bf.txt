PREFACE

IT WAs NEvER MY intention to become a historical sociologistMy interest in the upheavals of China's Cultural Revolution was firstsparked when I was an undergraduate in the early 1970s. At the time theywere very recent events. The startling transformations of the post-Mao eradiverted my attention away from this earlier period of upheaval, as theydid virtually every other student of contemporary China.In recent years Ihave returned to this long-neglected subject, and find that I have becomea historical sociologist largely through procrastination. It is fortunate thatI delayed serious engagement with this topic, because there now are vastlymore research materials on these events than were available to researcherssomedecadesago.The seeds for this particular study were planted in the late 1970s, whenI was a graduate student in the University of Michigan's Department ofSociology. For several years, I occupied a desk at the Center for ResearchonSocialOrganization,housedinasomewhatdilapidatedformerelemen-tary school, which became for a period my primary intellectual home. TheCenter's director, Charles Tilly, led a large research team gathering dataon collective protest from microfilms of old British and French newspa-pers, coding them into what at the time was called a“machine-readabledatabase." Tilly was then a leading figure in quantitative historical soci-ology,and alsopartofanascentintellectualmovementthatreshapedthestudy of collective action and popular protest. Other major figures in thisand related efforts—William Gamson, Jeffery Paige, and Mayer Zald—also occupied offices in the Center, along with graduate students engagedinresearch onpolitical conflictin different times and places.The Center's

Unfortunately, during those years China was closedtoscholars,anddocumentation about theconflicts oftheperiodwasun-available.Icouldonlydreamofpursuingthe analysisofChina'slate-1960supheaval in thefashion then common at Michigan.My fascination with this phase of the Chinese revolution never waned.As China opened up in the 1980s, the regime began to examine criticallyits recent history. During this process, a food of new information was re-leased, reviving my interest in the conflicts of the period. Early in the post-Mao era, the Chinese government mandated the publication of local an-nals,many of which contained surprisingly detailed accounts of politicalevents during the Cultural Revolution.Mindful of thepotential of thesematerialsfor thesystematic analysisofrebellion andrepression,Ibegan tophotocopy sections of annals that containedinformation about politicalevents. My collection effort accelerated as more local annals were published,making near-complete coverage of the country a realistic goal.By the time thatIjoinedStanford'sfaculty in1997,my collection in-cluded some two-thirds ofall cities and counties in China.While the photo-copying continued in libraries in Hong Kong, the United States, andoccasionally China,I employed a handful of graduate students in trial ef-forts to code these materials intoa database.This work culminated in aconcentrated final effort funded by a grant from the National Science Foun-dation in 2009 that completed a data set covering all but a few dozencounties in the country, and that contains information about close to34,000 political events in 2,246 cities and counties. This data set, alongwith the most detailed of the narrative accounts on which it is based,isthe primaryfoundationfor this book.Here I have made a conscious effort to look at this subject primarilythrough the eyes of social scientists who specialize in the study of rebellionand collective action.My aim is not solely to contribute new historicalknowledge and novelinterpretations of these still-obscure upheavals,

PREFACExialthough I amforced to address yawninggaps in the historiography of theperiod.I also hope towring from my analysis of these events a set ofideasthat will contribute to the way that social scientists analyze phenomena likerebellion and repression. China's Cultural Revolution was highly idiosyn-cratic, and in many ways historically unique, but it was driven by genericprocesses that have been observed in different guises in a wide variety ofhistorical settings. My purpose is to lay bare these underlying processes andidentify the general processes in theparticular.Barrington Moore, Jr., was one of the undisputed masters of historicalsociology, and he was vitally interested in the social sources of political phenomena. His work on the social origins of dictatorship and democracyinspired generations of scholars across a number of disciplines. Quite bychance, during my years at Harvard more than twenty years ago, we formedaclosefriendshipbased onshared tastes in academicsubjects andsailingexcursions out of Salem harbor. Like many scholars of his generation, forhim the question of how groups mobilized forpolitical action was distinctlysecondarytothemorefundamentalquestionofwhytheyformedcertainpolitical orientations. This question has receded very much to the back-ground in current work on political movements, especially in sociology. Insome ways this book is a throwback to the preoccupations of an earlier gen-eration. Both out of admiration for his intellectual accomplishments andaffectionfor adepartedfriend,IdedicatethisbooktoBarry'smemoryAGENTSOFDISORDER1ANENIGMATICUPHEAVAL

IN THE sUMMER OF 1966,thePeople's Republic of China wasapproaching the seventeenth anniversary of its founding.Taking power inOctober 1949 after a two-decade guerrilla insurgency and three-year civilwar,theChineseCommunistParty subsequentlybuiltoneof themostpowerfully centralized revolutionary regimes in modern history. Yet withinmonths of this anniversary, the civilian structures of this party-state wereonthebrinkofcollapse.Several ofthelargestcitieswereparalyzedbystreetbattles between factions of rebel workers that disrupted rail transport andlarge state enterprises. Soon afterward,a wave of power seizures toppledlocal governments, spurring the dispatch of the armed forces to stabilizenew structures of power.This,in turn,usheredin eighteen months ofevenmore destructive civil disorder and violent factional warfare,which in manyregions resembled civil war. A tenuous order was finally imposed near theend of 1968, placing most regions under a harsh regime of military con-trol. When the dust finally cleared in 1969, close to 1.6 million people haddied in the upheaval and the suppression campaigns through which po-litical order was rebuilt. What forces generated this remarkable upheaval,andhowdidsuch apowerfully centralized state unravel sorapidly?This dramatic and confusing three-year period was the most violentphaseofwhatwouldlaterbecomeknown asadecade-longCulturalRevo-lution. It was set in motion by Mao Zedong's remarkable decision to fomentrebellion against his own party-state as a means to halt the bureaucratization2AGENTS OFDISORDERthat afflicted virtually all regimes modeled after the Soviet Union. Thiswas an audacious act, completely unprecedented in the history oftwentieth-century communism.Theultimateresult,by1969,was a newstate structure built on ahierarchy of“revolutionary committees”com-posed of rebel activists, selected veteran officials, and military officerswho,in most regions,exercised real control.Without the support of Mao andhis enablersinthenationalleadership,this dramatic series of eventswouldnever have gotten underway.But how can we explain the confusing array ofconflicts that unfolded over these years, which often appeared to confoundMao himself? Powerful political forces were unleashed. What were they?More than a half-century on,much about this enigmatic upheaval re-mains deeply puzzling. There are large gaps in the historiography of theperiod, leaving basic questions unanswered. Prior to the collapse of civiliangovernments in early 1967, how widespread was popular mobilization andwhat forms did it take?How extensive was the wave of power seizures thatundermined local governments in early 1967, and who actually carriedthem out?Howdid theoverthrow oflocal governments alterpolitical alignments and drive large rebel coalitions to fight one another with increasingviolence well into1968?How extensive was theintervention of militaryunits across China,and what was their roleinlocal politics?How wide-spread were these violent clashes, and why did they prove so difficult toresolve? How was political order finally rebuilt, and at what cost?Answers to these questions remain elusive,in part,because past researchhas focused so heavily on the origins of confict within schools and work-places and the political activities of specific social groups.2 This focus hasshed considerablelight on a range ofpreviously obscure social cleavagesanddiscontentsinChina's closedsociety,but theconnectionsbetween thesegrievances and the broader conflicts that later erupted remained largely un-explored.Publishedregional accounts doaddressbroaderpatternsofcon-flict, but they are few in number and skewed toward large cities.3 The bestnational-levelnarrativesjumpselectivelyfromdevelopmentsinoneregionto developments in another, focusing on the ones that shaped the overallpolitical direction of the Cultural Revolution. In this book I shift the angleofvisiontothenationallevel,withafocus onmobilizationsthatundermined state structures,theformationof mass factions during1967,andtheviolentregionalclashesthatculminatedincampaignsofsuppressionin1968.

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL?3InterpretingtheConflictsWhat were the political forces unleashed during this tumultuous period?For many years we appeared to have a satisfying, if somewhat speculativeexplanation.From the outset,researchersviewedtheseviolentfactionalconficts as the struggles of interest groups. The new revolutionary order,which aimed to eliminate the severe inequalities of the old society, hadnonetheless generated distinctive new patterns of inequality and privilege.based on economic status and political affiliation. The regime's close mon-itoring ofcitizensforcompliance,itslabeling ofcitizensbased on theirdemonstrated or presumed political loyalties,and its conduct of regular political campaigns that left aggrieved citizens in their wake created reser-voirs of discontent andfrustrationthatbroke out intoviolencewhentheopportunity arose.° In the first months of this upheaval, groups that suf-fered disadvantages frequently protested the limits placed on their oppor-tunities,while those that enjoyed advantages or were tied closely to powerstructures mobilized to blunt the impact of rebellion and defend the ex-isting order. In later phases of the conflict,large rebel coalitions with op-posed stances toward theimposition ofmilitary controlfoughtviolentbattles across large regions of China. Factions that supported military forcesappeared to favor the restoration of the status quo and were labeled con-servative or moderate. Factions opposed to military control appeared de-terminedto continue therebellion,andweredesignated asradical.Itseemedreasonable to infer that the former represented relatively advantaged groups,while the latter represented the disadvantaged.7When it first appeared in the 1970s, the evidence for this broad inter-pretation was suggestive at best, given the limited sources available to researchers during the late Mao era. But its logic appeared to be unassail-able, and in the absence of other plausible explanations,it was widelyaccepted. The interpretation reflected a new trend in the analysis of Soviet-type societies that viewed them, not as totalitarian systems of total power,but rather as differentiated social structures with distinctive patterns of in-equality that suppressed,but did not eliminate,interest-based activity.Interest group conflicts were hard to detect in the Soviet Union,but thePragueSpring of1968amply demonstrated pluralist political competitionand group conflict.?Thefirst phases of China's Cultural Revolution seemedto illustrate the core tenets of this appealing new idea.104AGENTS OF DISORDERThis interpretation also fit closely with a then-new sociological perspec-tive onpolitical movements.The conflictsseemed todisplay apattern fa-miliar to students of protest movements in other settings——mobilizationby the aggrieved spurred a countermobilization by those with interests tiedto the existing order.l The central idea was that the opposed political ori-entationsthatdefinedthefactionalwarfareof1967and1968expresseddivergent interests tied to the social and political positions of actors. Theearlymonths oftheCultural Revolution radically changedthe structureof political opportunity, permitting the mobilization of dissident challengeswhile spurring a reaction by those with vested interests in the status quo.The rebelpower seizures that overthrewlocal governments across Chinainearly1967wereseen asa defeatfor theforces of order,whilethe subse-quent factional conficts were viewed as struggles to shape the new orderthatwouldreplaceit.The conflictsbetweenthese twoforcesbecame soviolentpresumablybecausetheyweresodeeplyrootedinstructures ofpower andinequality.Research over thepast decadehas eroded confidencein thisinterpretation.A new generation of scholarship,based on the much richer array ofsource material made available during the long post-Mao era, has steadilyundermined its core propositions. Evidence that once appeared to demon-strate the interest group foundations for factional conflict turned out notto be as convincing as once thought.In the early months of these conficts, marginalized groups did indeedtake the opportunity to articulate their grievances: these included tempo-rary and contract workers denied the benefits of permanent state employ-ment,urban youth sent involuntarily to the countryside,and demobi-lized soldiers sent toremote statefarms instead ofurban jobs.12 They wereamong the first to join rebel groups in 1966, and they openly presentedtheir demands. Their protests were prominent for a period, but theircause never defined the main lines of factional division,and their self-interested demands were repudiated in early 1967 and their movementsweresuppressed.13Therewas alsoafascinatingdebate abouttheregime'spracticeof cate-gorizing individuals based on their family background, which presumablypredicted their loyalty to the revolutionary regime. Those in favored “red”categories,especially those whose parents were veterans of therevolutionarystruggle, received enhanced opportunities for educational advancement and

ANENIGMATICUPHEAVAL5career opportunities. Stigmatized“black”categories included those whoseparents were from exploiting social classes or associated with the defeatedNationalist Party.14 Students in the favored categories claimed leadershipover the early Red Guard movement based on their families'heritage.Theydebated students from other family backgrounds, especially those with ed-ucated middle-class parents,who disputed their claims tobe“naturallyred." The latter tended to join the early rebellions against local leaders.15 Inonefamouscase,awidelydebateddissidentmanifestodenouncedtheen-tiresystem ofclasslabels.16Upon closer examination,however, the debate over family backgroundwas largely inconclusive, and it was overshadowed by a more consequen-tial debate over violence among high school Red Guards that found stu-dents from“revolutionary” households on both sides of an emerging fac-tional cleavage.17The famousmanifesto that denounced the system of classlabels generated widespread support, but it was denounced as reactionaryby the elite sponsors of the rebel movement who were close to Mao Zedong,anditwasrepudiatedbytherebelwingofthehighschoolmovementthatpresumably should have embraced its message.18The apparent significance of family class categories was further reducedbythediscoverythattheissuehardlyfigured atallinthemuchlarger andmore infuential Red Guard movement in theuniversities.Moreover,theleaders and activists on both sides of the emerging factional divide were stu-dents from politically favored households with records of past politicalactivism and Party loyalty.19 Students split over political stances taken underrapidly changing and ambiguous circumstances, forcing activists from sim-ilar backgrounds subsequently to defend their prior stances.20 The debili-tating split inBeijingbetween the“Heaven”and“Earth”factions pittedstudents with identical backgrounds and recent histories of political coop-eration against one another. It defied all efforts at reconciliation due to deepanimosities toward themostpowerfulRed Guardleaders onthetwolargestcampuses.21There were,tobe sure,those whomobilized to defend local authoritiesfrom the early rebel attacks. Party members and favored subordinates ap-peared initially to remain loyal to their superiors, and Party officials mobi-lized loyal subordinates as defenders.22 In the large cities of Nanjing andShanghai, alliances of workers known as“Scarlet Guards”mobilized nearthe end of 1966, relying on Party branches and official trade unions. For6AGENTSOFDISORDERalmost amonththeybattledwithalarge allianceofrebelworkers thateven-tually overthrew Shanghai's government.23 The broader significance ofthis development,however,was alteredbytherealizationthatScarletGuardorganizationsrapidlydisintegrated afterrebelpowerseizureswerepubliclypraised by Beijing. Moreover, it has become clear that the factions that en-gagedinviolentwarfare after the overthrowof local authorities expressedsplitswithintherebelmovementsthathadearliertargetedthe authorities.The movement-countermovement dynamic so evident in some large citiesnear the endof1966,as it turned out,endedwith the overthrow oflocalauthorities, and was replaced by an entirely new factional cleavage.24Animportantreasonfor the collapse of countermovement activity wasthat authority figures were divided against one another. In Nanjing, fac-tionsoriginatedamongworkersoutof antagonismsbetweentwoclearlydefined groups in the Party leadership of one of the city's largest industrialenterprises. This, in turn, mirrored divisions between the Party apparatusesin a Beijing ministry and the city of Nanjing.? Even more problematic wasnew evidence thatParty functionaries and the staff of government agen-ciesthemselves organizedrebellions againsttheir ownsuperiors,were alsodivided into factions, and were active participants in the power seizures thatoverthrew city and county governments.26 Divisions among these party-state cadres, and their active participation in rebel activities, underminedanymeaningful distinction betweenforces favorable to,or antagonistictoward, the status quo.The factional battles of 1967and 1968,as it turnedout, were not an extension of rivalries between the defenders and oppo-nents of local authorities in late 1966. Instead, they expressed splits amongthe rebel groups that had earlier sought to overthrow local governments.Atthecoreoftheideathatfactionalwarfareexpresseddifferentorien-tations toward the status quowas thefact that onefactionfought againstthe imposition of military control, while the other supported military units.In theselocal struggles,factions thatresisted military control appeared in-herently more radical;they wantedto rebel“to the end."Factions thatsupported the armed forces? attempts to impose order appeared by defini-tion tobemore conservative.These conflictswereinterpreted asfamiliarmovement-countermovementphenomena.Asresearcherspieced togetherlocalnarrativesoffactionalconflict,how-ever, it became evident that these stances did not have the meaning attrib-uted to them.Theorientations ofrebel factions toward military control,it

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL17turns out, did not express preferences regarding the restoration of order,but instead to the restoration of order on whose terms.Rebels competed formilitary support and turned against military units (or supported them)based on whether the military units offered support for their claims in priordisputes with other rebels. In some regions, rebel factions opposed to localmilitarycontrolwouldcalluponandreceivesupportfromothermilitaryunits.27 In other words, the stance of a rebel group's orientation toward mili-tary control did not signal an underlying political orientation regardingtherestorationof thestatus quo.Itwas a contingentproduct ofthegroup'shistory ofinteractionwithlocalmilitaryforces.Afamous examplethat appeared tocontradict thisconclusionwasano-torious"ultra-left”manifestoassociatedwitharebelallianceinHunanthat denounced China's entirebureaucratic class in the name of subordi-nate social classes.28 The group, known as the “Provincial Proletarian Alli-ance”(Shengwulian), was adamantly opposed to military control, and waspart of the last-ditch resistance.Statements that they issued near the endof 1967 called for liberation from oppression by the“red capitalist class."Yet a detailed analysis of the group's history revealed that these ideas didnot issue from a coalition of the marginalized, but were instead the productof a split over tactics within the rebel movement, a rhetorical framing ofdiehardresistancethatwasnotwidelysharedevenwithin thesplinterfactionthatgeneratedtheessay.Anin-depthexamination of thecasecon-cluded, “The birth of Shengwulian was thus impromptu, if not acci-dental... [it] signified the emergence of new political identities anddynamics ... the immediate causes of the split were relatively minor, thedifferences over tactics and approaches would later become magnified."29Instead, these were“emergent political ideas that granted new meaningsto ongoing conflicts"; they were the“contingent consequences of unfoldinginteractions."30The much more granular view of the formation of political conflict thatemerges from recent research suggests that the dominant process was thedivision of potential interest groups, not their attainment of solidarity, andtheformation of newpoliticalinterests and orientations,not continuityinpreviously fixed ones.3l In sociological terms, the political factions thatdrove conficts were emergent properties of sequences of political interac-tionincontextswherepoliticalinstitutionshadcollapsed,and alongwiththem the taken-for-granted expectations and meanings attached to them.8AGENTS OF DISORDERThey were not a function of predefined social and political positions, butrather were a product of interactive processes as conflicts unfolded.If factions were not a straightforward expression of interests and politicalorientations that were fixed beforehand, then an explanation needs tospecify and document the processes through which these groups and theirinterests formed. If interest group analysis, and its characteristic focus onmobilization, fails to explain the patterns of conflict during this period,what exactly is the alternative explanation? How does one provide ananalysis that does not simply recount detailed narrative histories?FactionsasEmergentPropertiesA focus on sequences of political interaction can generate alternative the-oriesabouttheoutcomesofsustainedpoliticalconfrontations.32Toclaimthat factions are emergent properties of political interactions requires thatwe specify clearly the social processes, or mechanisms, out of which fac-tionalidentities emerge.Thisimpliesthatwe cannotrestrictthe analysisto the variable characteristics of groups and political settings—the socialnetworks,group political capacities, and features of the political environ-ment. This further implies that narrative accounts comprised of sequencesof events are not troublesome detailsthatunnecessarily obscure thecleanlines of a causal analysis. Instead, these are the social processes upon whichaplausibleexplanationisbased.A neglected precursor of this line of analysis is Charles Tilly's accountof the social origins of the Vendee rebellion against the French revolution.33He traced the origins of the rebellion to the local impact of the revolu-tionary regime's 1791demand of a“constitutional oath”by Catholicpriests. This public oath required clergy to renounce the authority of thePope and pledge loyalty to the new regime in Paris. This split local priests.sometaking the oath,and others refusing,setting offdisputes thatdividedlocal communities. One of Tilly's most important discoveries was that therebellion split virtually all social classes, and divided Catholic clergy andtheir congregants against one another. The rebellion did not express classinterests in any meaningful sense. The opposed political factions were anemergentproperty of sequences ofevents touchedoff by thevariedreac-tion of Catholic priests to the demand to take the oath.34

ANENIGMATICUPHEAVAL19At the outsetweneedtobeclear aboutwhatexactlyneedstobeex-plained. Theories about protest and rebellion typically focus almost exclu-sively on theproblem of collective action—given certainpolitical interestsand orientations in a population, how are individuals mobilized to engagein collective action in pursuit of these common ends? These theories areabout political mobilization. They assume that groups with shared inter-estshave alreadyformed,or thatitis obviouswhothey are andwhatinter-ests they have. Our problem, however, is not to explain political mobiliza-tion,butpolitical orientation.Weneedtounderstandtheprocesses throughwhich opposed factions formed—not how collective action was achieved,but who engaged in what course of political action and why they did so.To explain the formation of factions we must understand the politicalchoices ofindividuals andgroups.At theindividuallevel,analyses of politicalmobilizationfocus narrowlyononechoice—whether ornottojoinwithothersincollective action,andwhether topersistinthat activity,onceit is underway.Thereis an extensive andvariedliterature onrecruitmentandcommitment.35Toexplain theformationoffactions,however,the rel-evant choice is not whether to engage in political action, but what courseof action to take, or which group to join, among a set of alternatives. Tofocus exclusively onthedecision tocontributetocollective actionpresumesthat political orientations are either obvious or analytically uninterestingTheories about protest and rebellion have an equally restricted concep-tion of the problem at the grouplevel. The emphasis of this line of analysisis the emergence of mobilized groups, and their capacity to sustain effectivemobilization and prevailinpolitical contestswith thestate or countermove-ments.Leaders adoptdifferenttactics andrhetorical appealsinthecourseof these conflicts,but these are analyzed solely in order to understand theirimpact ontheabilityofamovementtosuccessfullymobilizeinpursuit ofgroup aims.36 The substantive aims of group mobilization—-their interestsandpoliticalorientationsaresimplynotconsideredaspartoftheintel-lectual puzzle. They typically are treated as a given circumstance inherentin existing structures ofpower and inequality.As a result,these theoriesoffer little insight into the formation of varied political orientationsThiswasnot always thecase:an earliergenerationofscholarswas over-whelmingly preoccupied with explaining political orientations. Theoriesabout the origins offascism andcommunism,right-wingextremism10AGENTS OF DISORDERpolitical violence,intolerance,and moralcrusades were once the majonpreoccupation of political sociology.37Some of the most infuential theo-ries of that period lost credibility because they emphasized the impact ofsocial disorganization,hardship and frustration,individual alienation,and the erosion of social ties to family and community.38 These theorieswereunderminedbyempiricalresearchthatfoundarelationshipbetweenmeasures of group solidarity, organizational capacity, and levels of collec-tive protest,but thatfailedtofind a relationship with levels of hardshipdeprivation, or social disorganization.39 Closer examination of politicalmobilization revealed that it depended crucially on preexisting ties of soli-darity between smaller groups ofindividuals who were organized for otherpurposes. The observation that mobilization relied on “bloc recruitment"of smaller solidary groups, later reconceptualized as network ties,refutedthe proposition that individuals lacking ties to communities are drawnintoprotestmovements.40The refutation of older theories about the origins of political movementsled to a subtle andlargely overlooked shift of focus.Having demonstratedthatpoliticalmobilizationdepends oncertainforms of social solidarity,notsocialdisorganization,anewfieldemergedthatdesignatedmobilizationas the process of interest.This truncated the analysis ofpolitical movementsandnarrowedthefocus.Interestintheformationofpolitical orientationswas jettisoned in favor of a quite different stance: “It is taken for grantedthat a collectivity or quasi-group . . . with common latent interests, alreadyexists and that the members of the collectivity are dissatisfied and havegrievances."41 Theories about political orientation were replaced by theo-ries about political mobilization.In essence, the then-new wave of theoryaboutcollectiveactionmovedontoanewquestionwhileignoring theearlier one. This shift has endured in a large and intellectually diverse liter-ature on social movements and collective action.42Interest group explanations of factional warfare in China have the samelogicalstructure.Interestsandpoliticalorientations aretreatedasgiven,or exogenous—determined by a prior pattern of grievances or advantagein the status quo—and they are presumed to be stable motivators of political activity during the entire course of the conflicts.Political orienta-tionsare assumedtoexistbeforehandandprovidethebasisforcollectiveaction, which was facilitated when political opportunities shifted to permittheir openexpression.

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL11This approach topolitical conflicts is nowbeing questioned in analysesof ongoing political insurgencies around the world. Theories about civilconficts routinely posit a unitary actor that is engaged in a contest withagents of a state.3Yet insurgencies are often riven with factional cleavagesthat divide combatants who sharecommonlinguistic,ethnic or class char-acteristics. Insurgents move in and out of alliances with other insurgentgroups and with the forces of order and their political orientations and iden-tities shift during the course of conficts.44 There is an evident need,in thewords ofone analyst,“to take seriouslythe endogenous dynamicsof civilwars."45 How should such an analysis proceed?PoliticalOrientationasChoicePolitical orientations are the product of choices that individuals andgroups make among alternative courses of action. In the conflicts describedin this book, the primary choices can be stated very clearly. The first iswhether todefendor confrontindividualsinpositions of authority,inpar-ticular the leaders of local governments. The second is whether a rebel groupseeksmorethan concessionsfromleaders,andmovestooverthrowthemin a power seizure. The third, in the wake of such a power seizure, is whetherto support or oppose that act, whoever has carried it out. The fourth iswhether to support military units dispatched to stabilize order in the wakeof power seizures, or whether to oppose them.The fifth, after the forma-tionof distinctpoliticalfactions,is whether touse armedviolence.Insim-plest terms, these were the alternative courses of action faced by politicalactors at the time, and they defined political orientations. Individuals whomadesimilar choices coalescedintofactions.In an interest group analysis, the choice among alternative courses ofactionis aproduct ofthesocial andpoliticalpositions of actorsprior tothe onset of these conficts. Those who are disadvantaged in the existingsystem will presumably support attacks on the powerful; they will likelysupport the overthrow of local officials in power seizures, and after the in-terventionofthe armedforces theywilllikelyresistthedemobilization ofrebels andtherestoration oforderbymilitaryunits.Thosewho are advan-taged, on the other hand,will choose to shield the powerful from rebel at-tacks; they will tend to oppose their overthrow by rebels in power seizures;and they will tend to support the imposition of order by the armed forces.12AGENTS OFDISORDERIf, on the other hand, factions are an emergent property of evolving con-ficts,these logical connections are tenuous.Whatever the interests ofgroups based on their positions in the existing order, choices among alter-native courses of action are dependent on evolving political contexts.Undercertain circumstances, those who are privileged in the existing order willfind it in their interest to form rebel groups and join in attacks on powerfulofficials, and even to oust them from power——precisely in order to protecttheir positions. To do so they may willingly align themselves with rebelsthat express grievances against the existing order. Whatever the origins ofa rebel group, their support for a power seizure over the local governmentwill be contingent on their relationship to it. If they were included in apower seizure coalition, they were likely to support it; if they were excludedor preempted by others who acted more quickly,they were likely to objectto it. Decisions about whether to support or oppose the efforts of militaryunitstoenforceorderwill besimilarly context-dependent.Ifmilitary com-manders support a rebel group's stance in disputes with other rebels overpower seizures, those rebels will likely support that military unit; if not,theywilllikelyobjecttothearmy's actions.Theconnectionsbetweeninterestsandpoliticalchoices aredefinedbycontext.Another differencebetween these twolines ofreasoning is whetherchoice is conceived as interactive. An interest group analysis presumes thatindividuals and groups will choose courses of action solely based on theirownperceivedinterests,withoutreference tothe actions ofothers.Factionsin this view are essentially aggregations of like-minded individuals thatpursue shared interests in concert. If, by contrast, factions are an emergentproperty of interactions, the political stance of a group will be contingenton the actions of others.Will a rebel group that was excluded from a powerseizure become antagonistic to rebels who carried out a power seizure? Thatdependsonwhetherthosewhoseizedpowerrespondtooppositionwithdenunciation andrepression,orwithcompromise.Theirresponse,inturn,maybeafunctionofhowtheexcludedrebelsexpressedtheirobjections.Will rebel groups subsequently support or oppose military commanders?That depends on decisions taken by these commanders that either supportor undermine their claims in disputes with other rebels, and may furtherdepend on whether the armed forces responded withforce to criticisms oftheir actions. The social and political characteristics of members of a groupprovide little guidance to context-specific choices that are shaped by the

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL13actions ofothers.Theprocess isendogenous to the conficts themselvespolitical orientations and their associated identities are emergent proper-ties of the interactions among different parties.46Theprocess is notrandom,but there is a randomelement toit,becausefactions are a joint outcome of contingent interactions in a series of shiftingcontexts. Statistical theory refers to this as a“stochastic”process.In a de-terministic process one can predict an outcome based on the startingpointin this case the attributes of actors. Interest group analysis predictsthepoliticalorientationofactorsbasedontheirpositionsinsociopoliticalstructures at the outset of the period of observation. A stochastic processby contrast, is one where the eventual outcome is produced by a series of steps,orturningpoints.Ateach step,eachpartyfaces achoice among alternativecourses of action, and these choices are partly dependent on choices madeby other parties. This means that it is not possible to determine where anindividual or a mobilized group will end up, based solely on their interestsor motivations at the outset.This does not meanthat we are unable toexplain theformation ofgroups.It simply means that there is noessentialor fixed characteristic of actors that permits us to predict their politicalchoices ateachstepwithoutreferencetotheinteractivecontextswithinwhichpoliticstakesplace.47Out of a series of choices among alternative courses of action,groupsdeveloppolitical orientations—stances toward authorities,toward militaryunits, and toward other mobilized groups that become allies or opponents.It is out of these choices that factional identities are constructed in thecourse of ongoing conflicts. These are insurgent identities, which define foractors and opponents who they are in relation to other actors.48 In otherwords,actors constructcollectivepoliticalidentities,often inadvertently,outof thechoicestheymakeinevolvingcircumstances.To define theproblem as one of choice does notimply any stance aboutthe psychology of actors,or how they make choices. Usually conceived asquestions about the rationality of actors, this issue is often debated as if ithas momentous consequences for explanations of social processes. In thiscontext,such debates are a needless distraction.Choicein this setting washighly problematic, whatever we imagine the mental processes of actors tobe. Existing political institutions were either collapsing or had already col-lapsed, and expectations and norms based on prior experience no longerheld. A calculating, self-interested actor would find it very difficult to14AGENTS OF DISORDERanticipatethelikelyconsequencesofacourseofaction,giventheunprece-dented and constantly changing nature of the situation. Such an actorwould face a high level of uncertainty that would make choices highly prob-lematic. Choice is equally problematic for an actor whose choices are pre-sumably shaped by deeply held political commitments,or culturally shapedmodes of judgment.This actor would face a situation where the meaningsattachedtodifferentmodesofaction,andtheevaluationofestablishedin-stitutions,havebeenthrowninto question.This actorwouldfind that thenorms, values, and even personal loyalties long taken for granted can nolonger be——-requiring rapid judgments in novel situations. An actor orientedtoward meaningful activityfaces ahighlevel ofambiguity about how toapplyvalue commitmentsto an existing situation.The prevalence ofbothuncertainty and ambiguity makes highly problematic the idea that coursesof action, for both individuals and groups, were a product of perceived in-terestsorpoliticalorientationsattheoutsetofthisperiodofconflict.Given the contextual and interactive nature of choices, actors driven by pre-sumably different motivations would be as likely to make the same choicesastheywoulddifferentones.Evenwiththebesthistoricalevidenceitisimpossibletodistinguishwhich kind of motives are driving action. Strategic, self-interested actorsbuildmoral andpoliticalrationalesforthe correctness of their actions inorder tojustifythem andconvince others oftheirrectitude.Actors drivenby political and moral rectitude will be just as determined toprevail in localconficts as anyone else,and will befully capable of acting in a highly stra-tegic manner, precisely because they are so convinced of the rectitude oftheir position. Strategic, self-interested actors can convince themselves of(or deceivethemselves about)theirmoralrectitude.Committedidealists,for their part, can become ruthlessly strategic in pursuing their ends. Allactors will make decisions about courses of action in context,partly de-pendent on the actions of others. Their decisions, however they make them,arethefoundationoffactions.An interactive perspective on conflict also implies that the ideals andpolitical commitments that are expressed by groups can themselves be theproduct of these interactions,rather than an inherent feature of individ-uals and groups at the outset. To portray interactions as a series of choicesdoes not deny that there are powerful subjective elements and ideals forwhich groups fight. Studies of these conflicts have already illustrated the

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL15ways that new conceptions and political ideals emerged over time. TheApril 14rebels at TsinghuaUniversity,for example,intheirbitter rivalrywith amorepowerfulrebelfaction,eventuallydevelopedanexplicitratio-nale for a “moderate” political line that conformed with a recent shift indirection by the Central Cultural Revolution Group. But they did so onlyaftera rival rebel leader objected to that shift,creating a rhetorical openingfor this line of attack.49 The“ultra-left"Hunan rebel group Shengwuliandeveloped an elaborate critique of China’s “red capitalists” only near theend of their last-ditch fight against military control.50Theobservationthatideals andpoliticalcommitmentsaretheproductof political experiences rather than a set of beliefs fully formed prior to par-ticipationinpoliticsisfamiliarinothersettings.Studiesofantiabortionactivists in the United States,for example,have shown that activists ini-tially did not have clear beliefs about conception and unborn fetuses, anddeveloped them only during the course of participation in movement organ-izations.51 Similarly, the abolition of feudalism during the French Revolu-tionwasnotinherentinthelists ofgrievancesinitiallyrecordedin assem-blies of different estates in 1789. The demands and accompanying ideologyshifted over time aspopular assemblies in Paris responded to regional protests.52 The question is not whether ideals and political commitmentmatter——it is where these political commitments come from and how theydevelop.3 These ideals and commitments are part of the process of inter-action and identity building that we describe here—they are themselvesanoutcomeofthesehistoriesofinteraction.PoliticalContextsAt the core of any plausible explanation of the endogenous formationof groups,and the subsequent development of violent conflict, must be aclearunderstandingofthefeaturesofcontextsthatdefinethechoices thatactors face. This implies that the dynamic element in these endogenous pro-cesses is a sequence of shifts in political contexts over time.Individualsand groups do not constantly face the same choices in a repeating fashion—they face an evolving series of choices presented by contexts that can shiftinunanticipatedways.The idea that contextual shifts are the dynamic element in sustainedpolitical conficts is not a new idea. The familiar concept of “political16AGENTS OF DISORDERopportunity structure”is a statement about the context for groupmobili-zation, and it is inherently dynamic.The structure of political opportunitycan be defined by trends in national politics that provide elite allies oropponents,legalregimes,levels and techniques ofrepression,shifting strate-gies of repression, or the emergence of other mobilized groups that can pro-videeither allies or opponents.Therise andfall of protestmovements,theirevolution, and their level of success, can be readily traced to the opening upor closing down of political opportunities at the national or local level.54Political opportunity structures are invoked almost exclusively to explainthe propensity of individuals to join in collective action, or the success withwhich a group mobilizes to pursue its ends. But the concept is equally rel-evanttounderstandingchoices among alternativecourses ofaction,andcan readily be applied to understanding these choices. For this purpose,the centralpuzzleis not limited to the conventional one of explaining therise and fall of certain forms of political mobilization.It is to help usunderstand who the factional combatants were and why they engaged inviolentconflict.In this setting,thefirst dimension of political context was signals of sup-port or disapproval by actors at the apex of the national hierarchy re-garding different courses of action. This was important not only becauseChinahad a unitaryandcentralizedpoliticalhierarchythatreached downintoalmosteverylocalcommunity.Thesesignalsshiftedwithregularityand it was often unclear to local actors which pronouncements refectedMao Zedong's own preferences. Mao and his associates were the initiatorsof all rebel activity, and they tried to regulate and steer it over time. Localactors had little prospect of prevailing in courses of action that had the cleardisapproval of Beijing. There was,moreover, frequent uncertainty aboutwhich actors in Beijing authoritatively conveyed Mao's stance. Younger rad-icalmembers of theCentral CulturalRevolution Group,the adhoccom-mitteethatmobilizedrebellionsduringtheCulturalRevolution,oftenissued directives that encouraged action against civilian and militaryauthorities. Other actors, especially Zhou Enlai, issued directives that coun-tered or moderated these initiatives.55 Mao Zedong himself shifted hissupportfromonetendencytotheotheroverthecourseoftheseconflicts.These signaled shifts in the perceived likelihood at the local and regionallevel that certain courses of action had a chance to succeed.As we shall

ANENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL17see,thesesignalscouldhave a decisiveimpact onthecourses of actionchosenby locally mobilizedgroups.The second dimension is the local impact of events at the immediatelyhigher level of the political hierarchy. Events at the province level shapedthe choices of actors at thelevel ofprefectures andprefecture-level cities,andevents attheprefecturelevelshapedchoices atthelevelof countiesand county-level cities. The relevant shaping infuences were most evidentwithin the vertical lines of thepoliticalhierarchy.What mattered in a lo-calityweredevelopmentsattheimmediatelyhigherlevelinthehierarchyWhen a provincial government fell in a power seizure, this altered choicesfaced by actors in cities and prefectures immediately below it; and whenthe governments of these cities and prefectures were overthrown in turn,this shaped the choices faced in smaller cities and counties below them.After the collapse of provincial governments, it mattered whether the re-gion was placed under military control, or whether it was placed under anew government——a “revolutionary committee"—that had the explicit ap-proval of Beijing. This shaped the choices faced by actors lower in the hi-erarchy, as military control persisted, or gave way to an approved revolu-tionarycommittee,ateachstepdownwardinthehierarchy.A third element of political contexts was the stances of regional and localauthorities, both civilian and military, toward mobilized political groups,which could take the form of active support, passive acceptance, the mo-bilization of defensive countermovements, or aggressive repression by force.These stances, like the activity of mobilized groups, also depended heavilyon signals emanating from actors in Beijing, and the actions of both ci-vilian and military authorities during this period shifted repeatedly in re-sponse. Given the stances of local authorities—through most of this pe-riod and in most regions this meant military units——the decisive elementwas their capacity to enforce their decisions, and their willingness to actdecisivelytodoso.A fourth and final element of political contexts was the history of localpolitical interactions among rebel groups and between rebel groups andlocal authorities,in particular military units. Two aspects were particularlyimportant.The first was the pattern of alignments among rebel groups insupport of orin opposition to thepower seizures that toppled local authori-ties, and the way that these alignments were shaped by the actions oflocal18AGENTS OF DISORDERmilitary units when they intervened in local politics. These alignments werethe product of contingent encounters, and they created new cleavages thatgenerated political identities. The second was the prior history of conflictbetween factions, and in particular how long they endured and how vio-lenttheybecame.Thechoicesevolved asviolentconflictpersistedAFocusontheStateThe analysis in this book is framed by the architecture of China’s party-state, a single hierarchy that encompassed 174 cities of various sizes andmore than 2,200 rural counties.Iemploy an event-based analysis that drawson a database that is extracted from a near-complete collection of more than2,200 city and county annals, and combine this with an examination ofraw material from the longest and most detailed local narratives. By ag-gregating the political events described in local histories, I trace patternsofconflictacrosstimeandspace.This approach to analyzing political confict has not previously beenusedintheanalysis of China's CulturalRevolution,butithasbeenwidelyapplied in other settings—to both long-term shifts across historical time,andtorelativelybriefandintenseupheavals.56Studiesofthissortusuallyfocus single-mindedly on popular insurgencies.My sources,however, alsocontainawealthofinformationaboutthepatternofcollapseoflocalgovernments and their subsequent rebuilding, and acts of repression by mili-tary andcivilian authorities.Thisfacilitates an analysisthatportrayscon-Hict as a series of interactions between insurgents and authorities in shiftingnationalandlocalcontexts.A focus on the state requires us to pay close attention to the structure ofthisunitary andcentralizedhierarchy andalso the activities of theindi-viduals who staffed it.In 1965,there were 2.4 million offce personnel("cadres") who staffed Party and government organs, and a total of 21.5million Party members.57 They were organized into a single hierarchy thatreached deeply into the grass roots, well below the level of city and countygovernment. Their reaction to the events of this period, as we shall see, un-dermined China's party-state far beyond the capacities of the early popularinsurgencies, and local cadres continued to play an active role in the fac-tionalconfictsthatfollowed.

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL19Thisimplies thatweneedtofocus on thestateinasecondsense—localstate structures are sites of conflict and even rebellion, not just targets ofpopular insurgencies. Scholarship on this period has been singularly pre-occupied with movements among students,workers,and others who chal-lenged political authorities across China.But there was an equally dramaticpoliticalmobilizationwithin theparty-statebureaucracy.BeginninginJune1966,the state's structures were quickly thrown intointernal upheavalsthat interacted in complex ways with the unfolding political activism ofstudents and workers. Near the end of 1966, internal rebellions by party-state functionaries against their own superiors destabilized and eventuallydestroyed state structures far beyond the capacities of the popular rebel-lions thattheyfaced.Aswe shallsee,thelarge-scalefactional warfare thatwe associatewiththis earlyphaseoftheCulturalRevolutionbeganonlyafterlocalpowerstructureswereoverthrown.The idea that popular mobilizations are intimately connected with statestructures is familiar in historical studies of political contention. These pub-lications relate changes in the forms, rates, and styles of collective protestto the expansion of capitalism and the creation of more intrusive and cen-tralized state structures. Charles Tilly's work was notable for its emphasisonthehistoricalevolution ofstatestructures:“Thenationalstate'sgrowthentailedincreasingcontroloftheresourcesin a contiguous territoryby anorganizationthatwasformallyautonomous,differentiatedfromothenorganizations,centralized,internallycoordinated,and inpossession ofmajor concentrated means of coercion."58 This was matched by a parallelevolution in the organization of early-modern economies and societies. Theexpansion ofwagelabor and concentration ofcapitalinteractedwith theincreasingscope andcentralization ofstate structurestoincreasethe ca-pacity of urbanized populations to organize and pursue their interests intheformof themodernsocialmovement.59Over thecourseofhistoricaltrajectories“"we have much to gain from an analysis that singles out theeffects of large social changes on ordinary people's interests, opportunities,and organization, then examines how changing interest, opportunity, andorganization infuence their prevailing modes of collective action."6o Thisbook is part of that broad tradition of historical sociology, but its focus onthe relationship between state structures and political conflict is compressedinto a short and intense period of political upheaval. In such a compressed20AGENTS OFDISORDERperiod of time, the relationship of state structures to popular political mo-bilizationshiftsrapidlyinwaysthatrequiresmuchcloser examination.This focus on state structures is facilitated by the source materials thatform animportantfoundationfor thisbook.Throughout,I draw oninformationcontained inlocal annals(difangzhi)thatwerepublishedinChina by county and city governments after the mid-1980s. The annalsfor eachlocal government separatelyprovided its own account of politicalevents during this period,creating a framework for understanding thatmaps directly onto the state hierarchy. These annals revived a practice inimperial dynasties, when they contained accounts of local history, surveysofthelocaleconomy andsociety,andbiographiesofimperialdegreeholdersandotherlocalnotables.Survivingannalsfromthelasttwodynasties,theMing and Qing, have informed research on popular protest and collectiveviolence in earlier eras.6 The new annals contain general chronologies ofmajor events, and many of them also contain narrative accounts of specificpolitical campaigns, the local history of the Communist Party and gov.ernmentinstitutions,and avarietyof statistics onthelocalpopulationeconomy,andsocial structure.Accounts from a near-complete collection of 2,246 local annals havebeen coded and assembled into a data set of events (see the Appendix: LocalAnnals Data Set). Although the quality of local accounts and their level ofdetail vary widely, in the aggregate, the annals yielded an extraordinaryamountofinformation.Thedatasetcontainsinformation aboutcloseto34,000events at thecity or countylevelfromJune1966toDecember1971according to the month they occurred, and more than half of them ac-cording to a specific day.It also contains information for more thantwentyindicatorsofthedemographicandpoliticalcharacteristicsofthelocality,andthefeaturesof the accountfromwhichtheeventdatawerecoded.I employ the resulting data to trace the temporal and geographic spreadof certain kinds of insurgent activities and other key political events acrossChina's cities and counties and their evolution over time, alongside pat-terns of repression. My aim is to develop a clear, evidence-based descrip-tionthatwillilluminatelong-standing areasofignoranceandperhapsrec-tify misimpressions that that may haveresultedfrom the grassroots focusofpastresearch or theselectivenature ofregionalstudies.Thesebroaderpatterns will also help to identify puzzles that require further analysis by

The pat-terns revealed by the quantitative data frame questions that require acloser look at local narratives, and the processes revealed in the narrativesframequestionsthatwillrequireacloserlookatthestatisticalpatterns.One of the purposes of thisbook is to fill large gaps in the historiographyof this period——to accurately describe and characterize wbat happened.Butthere is an even more important explanatory agenda—why the conflicts oftheperiodunfolded astheydid.Asbroadpatterns ofpoliticalactivitycomeinto focus as part of the descriptive agenda,a series of explanatory puzzlescome into focus, some of them for the first time. To address these puzzles, itwill be necessary to depart from or modify the emphases of infuential the-ories aboutrebellion,revolution,andotherforms of contentious politicsThis defines the second task, which is to analyze patterns of conflict fromthe perspective of social science theory, to treat these patterns as puzzlesthat require explanation, and to generate ideas that extend theories aboutpolitical conflict into subjects about which they currently provide littleinsight.The first of these puzzles is brought into focus in Chapters 2 and 3, andanalyzed explicitly in Chapter 4: why did such a highly centralized and dis-ciplined party-state collapse so rapidly in early 1967? Theories about rebel-lion and revolution adopt two different approaches to this question. Thefirstviews the overthrow of governments as a consequence of the scale ofmass mobilization,which overwhelms a state's repressive capacities.In thewake of the unexpectedly sudden collapse of a series of state socialist re-gimes from 1989 to 1991, threshold models of collective behavior have cometo the fore, emphasizing the social processes that generate sudden upsurgesof popular protest.62 The second, an older“state-centered”stream of theory,departs from bottom-up views of revolution as a function of the scale ofpopular rebellion, and asserts that states are vulnerable only if they havepreexisting structural weaknesses that make them vulnerable to mass mo-bilizations.63Asweshalldiscover,localgovernments collapsed acrossChinain early 1967 well in advance of the spread of popular insurgencies, whichat the time were still very limited outside of the largest cities.Moreover22AGENTS OF DISORDERprior to these upheavals the Chinese state did not suffer from the struc-turalweaknesses emphasizedby state-centered theories.Asweshall see,theanswer to this puzzle lies in previously unexamined political processeswithin the party-state itselfa dimension of politics rarely emphasized intheories aboutrebellion andrevolution.Powerseizures diffuseddownwardin the national political hierarchy as party-state officials turned against theirsuperiorsasshiftingpoliticalcontextsredefined thechoicesthattheyfaced.The centralized and disciplined nature of the national political hierarchywasitself amajorreasonforitsrapidcollapse.Thesecondpuzzle,addressed inChapter5,is whylarge and antagonisticfactional alliancesformedinthewakeofthecollapseoflocalgovernments,andinparticularwhytheyadopteddifferentorientationstowardmilitaryunits thatintervened inlocalpolitics.Socialscience theories aboutrebel-lion and other forms of contentious politics——-either explicitly or implicitlytypically view confict groups as expressions of interests defined prior tothe activities of interest. I examine detailed local narratives and aggregatedata abouttheformationoffactionstoreconstructhowfactionsformedthrough a series of path-dependent interactions among disparate rebelgroups and military units. This is the core of the intellectual problem high-lightedearlierinthischapter.A third puzzle, addressed in Chapters 6 and 7, is why violent factionalwarfare ensued.To explainhowfactionsformedisnot to explain why theysubsequentlyengagedinviolentconflict.Asweshallsee,large-scalefac-tionalwarfaredidnot occureverywhere,andtheintensityofviolencein-creasedthelonger thatitpersisted.Whatdrovethis collectiveviolenceincertain regions,which proceeded to the point where close to a quarter-millionofthecombatantswerekilled?Socialsciencetheoriesaboutcol-lective violence typically attribute it to the enormity of the stakes for dif-ferent social classes or ethnic groups, as a reaction to violence initiated bythe state's agents,or as a strategy that sustains mobilization and wears downopponents. These explanations all focus——-explicitly or implicitly——-on howcollective action is initiated and sustained.Instead,we willfind that thekey to explaining the severity of the violence is in understanding how col-lective action ends—in particular, the anticipated costs to participants offailing to prevail over their opponents, or at least fight to a draw. Prolongedhistories ofunresolvedconflictswere thefeatures oflocalcontexts thatdrove escalating violence. By examining circumstances under which the

AN ENIGMATIC UPHEAVAL23mostsevereviolence occurred,itwillbecome evidentthattheproblem ofexitfrom collective action explains themost severe andsustainedviolence.In certain circumstances,combatantswere drawnintoself-reinforcinges-calationtraps.A fourth and final puzzle is addressed in Chapter 8, which examinesthe process through which state authority was reestablished.Prior work hasdemonstrated that therestoration oforderwasfarmore damagingin termsof lives lost and disrupted than themany months of violent disorder thatpreceded it. Four to five times as many people died in the campaign to re-establish order, primarily after the end of insurgent activity.°4 In this pen-ultimatechapterIwillseektoexplainwhythiswasso.Throughoutmanymonthsofviolentregionalwarfare,China’s armedforces alwayshadthecapacity to quell armed civilian insurgencies. As 1968 progressed, in oneregion after another, military units were given freer rein to compel localfactionstodisarmanddisband.Yetdeathtolls andpoliticalvictimizationrose to unprecedented levels after factions were disarmed and disbanded,when they and other citizens returned to their places of residence and work.How to explain the puzzling timing of this upsurge of repression,whichwentfarbeyondwhatwasnecessary todemobilizerebel combatants?Scholarship on this period, like many accounts of popular upheavals,has been preoccupied with mobilizations by ordinary citizens to confrontagents of the state. In this historical episode,however, the groups that onewould ordinarily expect to be bulwarks of the political order—in partic-ular, party-state cadres and military units—contributed to these upheavalsin ways that turned them into agents of disorder. The process unfolded inthe last half of 1966, when the state's structures were quickly thrown intointernal upheavals that interacted in complex ways with the growing po-litical activism ofstudents andworkers.It is tothe extensive andvariedpolitical mobilizations of the last half of 1966 that I now turn.2MOBILIZINGANATION

SEVERALVARIETIEsOFpoliticalmobilizationshapednationalpolitics during the last half of 1966. By the end of the year they had de-stabilized a number of large cities and had begun to undermine politicalauthority elsewhere in the country. The rapid spread of mass mobilizationinthelasthalfof1966is not hardtoexplain.Thepolitical movementstouched off in China in 1966 were inspired and supported by actors at theapex of a highly centralized and intrusive state structure. Initially students,and eventually workers,were given every encouragement to form indepen-dent organizations,and they were provided with the resources necessaryfor their activities.The security services and armed forces,which normallysuppressed such activities with great effectiveness, were ordered not to in-terfere. State agencies shifted away from systematic repression to active fa-cilitation of certain forms of popular mobilization. Independent politicalgroups were permitted freely to publish their own broadsheets and hand-bills, and topublish copies of leaders?speeches and transcripts of meetingsthat would normally be highly classified. They shared this information vianetworks oflike-minded groups across the country.Therewas an additional,less obvious structuralfoundationfortherapidand widespread mobilizations of 1966.The same political structures thatpermitted the state to penetrate, monitor, and mobilize ordinary citizenstowardapprovedpoliticalendsinadvertentlycreatedsocialnetworksthat24

MOBILIZING A NATION25facilitated independent political mobilization. China’s revolutionary regimeorganized citizens in workplaces and neighborhoodsinto smaller units thatserved as sites for monitoring and control. Students were organized by entrycohortintoclassesofseveraldozenindividualswhostayedtogether overthe years and participated in regular organized activities even outside theclassroom.2Employees remained in their assigned workplaces for much oftheir lives,with almost no turnover. These individuals were similarly orga-nized into smaller unitsbasedon offices andworkshops,and dividedintosmaller groups for political study and other activities.Members of the Com-munistParty,roughly20percentof theurbanadultpopulation,werethemselves organized into branches that averaged 12 to 15 individuals, whometregularlyforparty-directed activities.3Even on collectivefarms,fam-ilies were organizedintoproductionteams thatservedboth asunitsofresi-dence and units of political and economic organization.4Under ordinary circumstances,these structuresfacilitated the regime'scontrol, monitoring populations in ways that curtailed the possibility ofindependent collective action.But these structures also createdlocal soli-daritiesthatfacilitatedindependentpoliticalactivitywhenpoliticalcon-texts were radically altered in thelasthalf of1966.Collective action in so-cial movements frequently builds on preexisting solidarities,recruitingadherentsin entireblocsrather than as isolated individuals.5Individuals whowere already organized into classrooms, workshops, small groups, and partybranches reliedupon these social networks and organized themselvesinto avariety of small and informally organized independent groups during thisperiod. Larger alliances initially were loose assemblages of these smallenunits.Largerfactional coalitions across schools andworkplaces,in turn,wereassemblages of these within-school and within-workplace aggregations.At the outset,virtually every Red Guard and rebel organization thatemerged during this period—whether among students,blue- or white-collarworkers, or party-state cadres——exhibited an unmistakable“cellular”struc-ture. Individuals participated in broader political alliances as members ofsmall“fighting groups"(zhandou dui), based on the groups they were a partof in their daily life. These groups maintained a separate identity, partici-pating in larger alliances as small solidary groups. This cellular pattern fa-cilitated the rapid expansion of rebel insurgencies, but it also created a re-curringproblemoffragmentationanddivision.Notuntilmuchlaterdid26AGENTS OF DISORDERrebel alliancesbegintoformcohesive and disciplined organizations.In theearlymonths,theleadersofeachofthesmallerunitscouldreadilybecomerivals,creating chronic discord and frequent splits.This pattern would even-tuallyhaveimportant consequences for theformation of factions after theoverthrowoflocalgovernments.There were six separate varieties of political mobilization that unfoldedduring the last half of 1966. Some were top-down campaigns to investi-gate political loyalties; some were independent groups that did not threatenpolitical authorities; some targeted political authorities for criticism and re-moval; and some mobilized to protect authorities from rebel attacks. Thefirst,which was oftenneglected in accounts of thisperiod,was mobiliza-tion within the national bureaucracy for loyalty investigations that nettedvictims at all ranks in the political system. Spreading rapidly across Chinabeginning in June 1966, this was a conventional loyalty investigation con-ducted by top party officials at each level of the hierarchy. The second wasanationwidemobilizationofuniversityandhighschoolstudentsintoaRedGuardmovement thathad official sanction and support at all levels.RedGuards mobilized to denounce faculty members and school administra-tors,and attackindividuals andphysical artifacts thatrepresentedreac-tionary historical legacies. The third was a breakaway “rebel” faction ofthe Red Guards that turned its critical attention to top officials in localand national governments. The rebel movement grew in scale and militancyafter it received the open approval and encouragement of Mao and his fol-lowers in October 1966. The fourth, which got underway in mid-November,was a rebel movement among industrial workers and other salaried em-ployees, a development that greatly magnified the scale and impact ofpopular rebellion in large cities. The fifth was a countermovement in op-position to rebel attacks on authorities. These groups initially formed withinparty and government offices in September, aiming to secure them againststudentrebels.InNovember,thistooktheformofcountermobilizationbyworkers in large state enterprises to confront workerrebels on the streets oflargecities.Thesixth andfinalformofmobilization,whichspreadrapidlyin December, was a rebellion by cadres inside the party-state hierarchyagainst their own superiors.These internalrebellions were critical for thespread of power seizures that toppled regional and local governments acrossChina inearly1967.

MOBILIZING A NATION27InsidetheBureaucracyAt the outset of the Cultural Revolution, China had a highly disciplinedand centralized political hierarchy. The opening salvo of a new loyalty campaign was the announcement on May 16, 1966, that an “anti-party con-spiracy” had been uncovered in the highest reaches of the party. The headof the Central Committee's Propaganda Department, the Chief of Staff ofthePeople'sLiberationArmy,theChiefofStaffoftheCentral Committee,and Beijing's Party Secretary were all condemned as revisionists who soughtto undermine Mao Zedong's revolutionary political line. The documentlaunched a campaign intended to root out others with similar political ten-dencies, and the immediate impact was an unfolding purge campaign thatdecimated theleadership and staff of the central party bureaucracy and theadministrationof thenation'scapital.6To prosecute these loyalty investigations, large investigative“work teams(gongzuo dui) and smaller“work groups”(gongzuo zu)were dispatched togovernment agencies to examine theirpersonnel, and they were also senttouniversities andhigh schools,research institutes,andlarge state enter-prises for the same purpose.7 In the schools they mobilized students duringJune and July in an unfolding campaign to denounce and unmask anti-party elements in educational institutions.In August 1966 the student RedGuard movement was the most visible result. During the same period, alesser-noticed mobilization for an internal political campaign unfoldedwithin the party-state hierarchy itself. Officials in charge of provincial andlocal governments throughout China were compelled to respond to the newdirective. The Party Center——Mao Zedong——-had decreed that “Khrushchev-type bourgeois representatives"that had sneaked into the party in“all prov.inces, cities, and autonomous regions."For provincial party leaders this wasthe key passage in the document, indicating it was their responsibility toshow zeal in uncovering and punishing such figures in their own jurisdic-tions.8 High officials in the nation's capital had already fallen in disgrace,and the vigorous prosecution of loyalty investigations was the only way fonregional officials to ensure that they remained above suspicion. In July,Beijing decreed that“the spearhead of this Proletarian Cultural Revolu-tion is pointed at representatives of the bourgeoisie who have snuck intothe Party, the government, the army, and various cultural institutions,28AGENTS OF DISORDERand especially at the small groups of power-holders who are anti-party,anti-socialist,and anti-Mao Zedong Thought,”and furthermore that“allpartyandgovernmentorgansattheprefecturelevelandabovemustlaunch this campaign without exception." The process of unmasking andremoving anti-party elements would proceed within the organs of the party-state atthesametime asitunfoldedinschools.Otherhigh-levelvictims were soon identified.Two provincessaw theirtop leaders suddenly removed for alleged anti-party activities. Inner Mon-golia's First Party Secretary was summoned to the capital in late May alongwith other top regional officials and subjected to accusations that he hadpromoted Mongolian separatism. He was held there until late July and wasremoved from all of his posts, along with several other members of InnerMongolia's top leadership.1° In late June the First Party Secretary of HebeiProvince was called to a meeting in Beijing and denounced along with sev-eral other leading provincial offcials. He was stripped of his posts and theprovincial leadershipwas reshuffled.lThe leaders of other provinces displayed their vigilance by hunting for"anti-party elements”in their own jurisdictions.They formed“CulturalRevolution Committees” to conduct loyalty investigations and mobilizedthousands of investigators into work teams that were sent into universities,high schools, newspaper offices, and cultural troupes to search for politicaldeviance.1 Provincial party committees also conducted loyalty investiga-tions withintheir ownranks,initiallyfocusingheavily on departmentsre-sponsiblefor propaganda,culture,and education.They did not limit theirattacks to low-ranking officials and intellectuals, although many such fig-ures were also widely targeted. In most provinces at least one rankingmember of the top provincial leadership, frequently the official in chargeof propaganda, was purged in June or July. The purges typically extendedto a number of their subordinates, frequently the editor of the local news-paper, the head of the provincial writer's association, the heads of local uni-versities or the party's training school for its cadres.Provincial histories arefilled with details about these loyalty campaigns.Anhui formed aninvestigation committeeimmediately after thefirst purgesin Beijing, and convened a three-week meeting, beginning May 23rd, forall party secretaries of provincial departments,bureaus,prefectures andcitiestoprepareself-examinationsoftheirpoliticalconduct.Duringthesemeetings the provincial party secretary in charge of the Propaganda De-

MOBILIZING A NATION29partment was targeted for alleged disloyalty. In early July he was said tohave led an anti-party group in his department that included the editorialteam of the party's newspaper,AnhuiDaily.13 TheFirstPartySecretary ofFujian organized a provincial party congress in mid-June to lay out plansfor the Cultural Revolution, and by early July several leading provincialofficialswereunder attackfortheirworkinthePropagandaDepartmentthe Party School, the Culture Department, the Provincial Writer's Asso-ciation, and Fujian Daily.4 In Gansu, thePartySecretary of Lanzhou Uni-versity was declared a counterrevolutionaryin late June and committedsuicide; the head of the Provincial Propaganda Department, a member oftheprovince'sStandingCommittee,wasdenounced as a counterrevolu-tionary along with his deputy, the editor of Gansu Daily.15 In Guangxi avice-head of the Propaganda Department and the editor-in-chief of GuangxiDaily both fell in mid-June.16 In early July a party secretary who had re-cently headed Tibet's Organization Department was denounced along withtheeditor-in-chiefof TibetDaily,andwas soon removed officiallyfrom allposts.7 Jiangsu's Party Secretary launched the campaign at a mass rally inearly July, and soon thereafter more than 400,0o0 wall posters attackingleading cadres appeared in 57 of the 65 provincial agencies.18These campaigns in provincial governments were replicated in jurisdic-tions under them. Within the city government of Nanning, the capital ofGuangxiProvince,more than1,oooleadingcadres and intellectuals,pri-marily in propaganda, news, and cultural organizations, were targeted bythe end of June as“anti-party elements”and subjected to abusive massmeetings known as “struggle sessions" within the organs of the city's partyand government.!9 These campaigns extended as far as the party bureau-cracy reached, even into remote regions. Oficials in Linzhi County, a pre-fecture capital in eastern Tibet, were already mobilized for an internal criti-cism campaign in late May. They were informed that anyone in the partyand government organs could be criticized, “no matter how high their po-sition."20 These are just a sampling of the many cases detailed in publishedhistories, and they suggest that the bureaucratic organs of provincial gov.ernments and their capital cities were disrupted by divisive and threateningloyaltyinvestigationsthat nettedprominent officials and their closeassociates.Oftenlostin accounts of thisperiod thatfocus on student activismis thefact that the national bureaucracy itself was already thrown into upheaval.30AGENTS OF DISORDERThese events put all government functionaries on notice that their loyaltywas subject to challenge, and that their positions were potentially at risk.The potential consequences ranged from a ruined career to a harsh term ofimprisonment or expulsion to a labor camp. This forced party and govern-ment functionaries at all levels to be closely attentive to political signalsemanating from Beijing, and to adjust their behavior to ensure that theywould not be swept up in the purge campaign. As the months wore on,however,it alsoforced them into difficult choices,and as signals fromBeijing shifted, they adjusted their behavior in ways that would underminethepoliticalorder.StudentRedGuardsAs the national bureaucracy mobilized during June and July for internalloyalty campaigns, investigators were also sent into universities and highschools to mobilize a campaign against political deviance. They proved tobe highly disruptive. Those sent to schools typically orchestrated accusa-tionsagainst atleastsomeleadingschoolofficials,andmanyofthemcon-ducted purges that were radical and extensive.They also mobilized studentactivists andyoungerfacultytodenounceseniorfacultyandschooloffi-cials. However, unlike the intra-bureaucratic campaigns, these work teamsmet with spirited opposition and struggled to maintain control. Militantstudents and young instructors vied with work teams over the designationof targets and their treatment. In some settings the struggle was over thedirection of the campaign, especially the designation of political targetsamong the school's leading officials. In some settings students who formedindependent organizations were warned that they wereforbidden. In othersettings the conflicts were over the treatment of targeted individuals,par-ticularly the extent to which student militants would have free access tothem for humiliating and violent “struggle sessions" that could result insevereinjury andeven death.Theconfictsinschoolsbecame sosharp thatmany work teams actuallyfedfrom their campus,only tobe replaced laterbymoremilitantworkteamsthatcounterattacked againststudentactiv-istswhocontinuedopenlytodefy authority.Inmanycasestheworkteamsretaliated against the most defiant students and faculty, labeling them asanti-partyelementsfortheirdisruptivebehavior.21

The studentswho defied work teams earned Mao's praise,and they were held up asmodelsfor studentmilitants across the country.Maotookseveral steps tosignal that independent student mobilization was permitted, and in factstrongly encouraged.After this point nolocal leaders could contemplateobstructing the formation of independent Red Guard units among stu-dents. This was now official policy, backed by China's supreme leader.Local officials typically provided encouragement and support for the bur-geoning student campaign.Anassemblyofstudentmilitants was held inthe GreatHallofthePeople, at which Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping, three ofthe top seven ranking officials in the party hierarchy, apologized for thework teams'alleged suppression of student activism.Mao himself appearedon the stage and greeted the students.22 At a subsequent party conferencethat began on August 1, Mao had wall posters authored by some of the firststudent Red Guards reproduced and distributed to participants along withhis editorialpraise,andheissuedoneofhis own thatencouragedstudentsto “bombard the headquarters."23 On August 18, Mao appeared at the firstofaseries ofeightmassralliesheldforRedGuards onTiananmenSquare.Appearingontherostrumwith arangeofstudentleadersfromthenation’scapital, he donned a Red Guard armband, engaged in friendly conver-sations with student leaders, and had several of them give impromptuspeeches.24The statemediapraised themilitant students andmade clearMao'sstrong approval of their organizations.In the weeks to come Mao's radicalassociates established ties with studentleaders in the nation's capital.Stu-dents were permitted free travel on the railway system, and reception cen-tersweresetupinthenation'scapitalandotherlargecitiestoprovidelodging and food for traveling students. To make absolutely certain thatthestudent movement would be givenfreerein,two separate directives wereissued in late August that forbid public security agencies and the armedforces from“interfering”with or“suppressing”Red Guard activities.25 Thesame message was hammered home after reports of popular resistance to32AGENTS OF DISORDERRed Guard activities. On September 11, Mao issued an instruction, dis-tributednationwideasacentralpartydocument,thatforbidtheincitementofworkers,farmers,or soldierstotry toblockthe activitiesofstudentmilitants.26With this level of official support, the Red Guard movement grew rap-idly. Beijing was the epicenter, with Red Guard organizations spreadingacross high schools in early June, and with imitators soon to appear in theprovincial capitals. Figure 2.1 charts the spread of this initial surge of stu-dent political activism, as recorded in local annals. The trend lines tracethe cumulative percentage, by month, of the first mention of local RedGuard activity at different levels of China's political hierarchy,from pro-vincial capitals to other large “prefecture level” cities, to smaller “county-level"”cities,and rural counties.Red Guard activities typically were ex-pressed in critical wall posters, the subjection of teachers and schoolofficials topublic denunciation meetingsknown as“struggle sessions,”orthe destruction of temples, churches, artwork, and books deemed to beremnants of the reactionary cultures of feudalism and imperialism. RedGuardswererare across ChinainJune andJuly,but this changed dramati-cally after the nationwide publicity given to the first Red Guard rally onTiananmen Square on August 18.Students rushed to form Red Guardorganizations, make political accusations against faculty and administra-tors in their schools, vandalize temples and artwork, and take advantageof free travel around the country—especially the coveted opportunity totravel to Beijing and attend the Tiananmen Square rallies. Almost all ofChina’s cities reported Red Guard activity by the end ofAugust,as did themajorityofcounties.ByOctobermorethan85percentofcountiesreportedlocal Red Guard activities.27These figures represent a remarkable level of popular political mobiliza-tion.

Thesenumbers do not convey the relative size of student mobilizations—theysimply record the first reports of any local Red Guard activity. One mightsuspect, given the large differences in the size of local student populations,that the Red Guards were a more disruptive force in the larger cities. Clearly,however, students were mobilized nationwide for activities that had the ap-proval of the highest political authorities, and they were free to organizethemselves to do so.The Rebel MovementRed Guard activists initially focused on their own schools and nearbyneighborhoods, and early Red Guard actions were directed primarily atschool faculty and administrators,remnants of former“exploiting”classesin nearby residences,and the destruction of historical artifacts and build-ings that represented China’s old “feudal" culture. But a minority of RedGuards, led by university students who had clashed with the officials whostaffed work teams, began to target these offcials and their superiors in thegovernment agencies that had sent them. This new trend began in Beijing.34AGENTSOFDISORDERwhenstudentswhohadclashedwithworkteamsmarchedtonationalministriesanddemandedthattheofficialswhohadstaffedworkteamsreturn to their universities to be criticized, apologize for their errors,andturn over dossiers that they compiled on students that had challenged theirauthority.

Itdisplays the cumulative percentage of jurisdictions, by month and juris-diction level,whose annals first mention activity by“rebels”(zaofan pai) inopposition to local authorities.

Near the end of the meeting, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaopingwho had been designated as responsible for this “bourgeois reactionary line(zichan jiejifandongluxian),gave self-criticisms;immediatelyafterward theywere demoted in the party hierarchy, and they soon disappeared from publicview.30From this point on, Mao and his allies signaled their strong support forthe rebel movement. In mid-November, two central directives met the pri-mary demands of rebel factions:that all rebel activists who had been pun-ishedafter earlierclasheswithworkteams or other authoritieswouldhavethe charges against them withdrawn, and that the related “black materials"would be destroyed and removed from their permanent files.31As Figure 2.2 makes clear, only after October did rebel activity beginto approach the levels of Red Guard activity seen in Figure 2.1. The rebelmovement spread earliest in the provincial capitals and large cities,moreslowly in the small cities, and slower still in the counties. By the end ofDecember, it appears to have been established in most jurisdictions, thoughthe percentage reporting rebel activity was still well below the percentagesreporting Red Guard actions. In counties, only two-thirds of the annalsmention any rebel activity at all during1966.36AGENTS OF DISORDERRebelWorkersAs long as rebel insurgencies were limited to universities and highschools,theirimpactwasrelativelymodest.Shouldindustrialworkers andother salaried employees form rebel groups, however, this would greatlymagnifythelevels ofpoliticaldisruption.Therewere only674,000uni-versity studentsinChina inthe springof1966,but therewere52millionurbanworkers and staff.32Ifurbanworkers joinedintherebel attacks onlocal government officials, their sheer numbers could fundamentally alterthe scale and impact of the popular rebellion. Unlike the student rebellion,the large-scale mobilization of rebel workers could potentially lead to shut-downs of factories and paralyze the national transportation networks. Theentry of workers into the rebelmovement threatened to greatly escalate boththe scale andimpact oftherebelinsurgencies.These implications were well understood by officials in charge of man-aging China's economy, and they argued against the spread of independentpolitical activitiesintoproductivesectorsoftheeconomy.Thelimitsprovedveryhardtoenforce,becauseaminorityofworkerschallengedtheirfac-toryleaders almostfromtheoutset.InShanghai,whereworkteamsweresentintolargestatefactoriestoconductthecampaigninJune andJuly1966worker opposition emerged in ways that paralleled that in the universities.Individualswhowouldlaterestablishacitywideallianceofworkerrebelschallenged the work teams sent to their factories during June and July.

InAugustandSeptembertheseincipientrebelleadersbegantoformsmall“fighting groups" that mimicked the student rebels, and they openly con-tested with work teams over control of the campaign.33In Nanjing a somewhat different pattern of confict emerged, and onethat generated a prominent campaign against the Nanjing party authori-ties much earlier than in Shanghai. The workers' rebellion in Nanjing wassparked by cleavages created in large state factories by work teams sent intwo years before, during the Socialist Education Movement—in particular

MOBILIZING A NATION37at the Yangzi River Machine Works.34 The earlier campaign had dividedthe factory's management and workforce, with one side bearing the bruntof a draconian loyalty investigation. Large percentages of the staff and man-agement were subjected to humiliating struggle sessions and charged withpolitical crimes, along with significant numbers of workers and technicianswho were associated with them. The campaign was halted in mid-coursein 1965 for being too harsh, and an uneasy compromise was fashioned thatpermitted a factory director who had been attacked in the campaign to re-tain his post, while the factory's party secretary, one of his tormentors,continued in office.When the Cultural Revolution began in June,thefactory's party secretary renewed the campaign against those he hadtormented two years earlier, and activists who supported him called forthe firing of the factory director for trying to“restore capitalism." Severalhundred of the factory director's supporters marched to the NanjingMunicipal Party Committee to submit a petition demanding his rein-statement in mid-August, and in response more than 2,ooo workers whosupported his purge marched to the Nanjing party offices to oppose his re-instatement. The Nanjing authorities refused to ratify the purge, leading toanother large demonstration on August 22 by more than 2,000 supportersof the factory Party Committee who denounced the decision of the Nanjingcityauthorities.This group of rebel activists, who called for the purge of their factorydirector but who supported their factory's party secretary, and who nowwere in rebellion against the Nanjing party authorities, formed a rebelorganization——Red Flag——near the end of August 26. Three days later theiropponents in the factory formed their own rebel organization—RedWorkers—who opposed their factory's party secretary but supported theNanjing Party Committee. Red Flag sent a delegation to confront the Nan-jing authorities at the end ofAugust, and after failing to change theNanjingparty's decision, they sent more than 1,ooo members by train to lodge acomplaint with national authorities inBeijing.TheRedFlagrebels,opposedto the Nanjing authorities, played a leading role two months later inorganizing the first citywide worker rebel alliance in opposition to the cityand provincial authorities. The Red Workers, who found the Nanjing au-thorities sympathetic to their stance, played a major role in the large alliance of workers who supported the city authorities and fought in the streetsagainst therebelworkersneartheendof1966.38AGENTS OF DISORDERResponding to incipient rebel activity in factories, Beijing issued a di-rectiveinlateSeptemberthatreiteratedofficialdisapprovalofindependentpolitical activity by workers. It restated the prohibition against indepen-dentpoliticalgroupsinworkplaces,publicinstitutions andparty andgovernment agencies. Groups that had already formed were told to disband.Contacts with groups in other workplaces and travel away from their placesofresidencewerebothforbidden.35Thisprohibitionhadlittleeffectincitieswhereworkerswere alreadyorganizing into rebel groups. This was especially evident in Shanghai, whereevents would soon have a major impact nationwide. Rebel activities amongShanghaiworkers,whicheventuallyledtooneofthefirstcitywidecoali-tions of rebel groups, accelerated in early October.A factory security of-ficer named Wang Hongwen put up a wall poster that accused his factory'swork team of carrying out the “bourgeois reactionary line." On October 10he formed thefactory's first rebel organization,issued a proclamation toallworkersin thefactory,and led a small delegation of rebelworkers toBeijing to lodge a complaint against the factory's work team.After Wangreturned to Shanghai in late October,he pulled together disparate rebelgroups into an alliance and pushed for the work team to withdrawfromthe factory.His group took over the factory loudspeaker system and invadedthe offices occupied by members of the work team.36In the wake of the October Party Work Conference and the intensifiednew campaign against the “bourgeois reactionary line,” opposition toworkers’ involvement softened in Beijing. Near the end of October, Maostated that workers should get more actively involved in the campaign,raising the question of what form this involvement should take.The issuewas brought to a head in Shanghai by the formation of a citywide allianceof worker rebel organizations, the Shanghai Workers Revolutionary RebelGeneral Headquarters, in early November. In their founding proclamation,they charged that the Shanghai party authorities had followed the bour-geois reactionary line.The group made three demands of the city authori-ties: that they recognize their coalition as a legal organization; that theMayor attendtheirplannedmassrally andheartheircriticisms;and thatthe authorities provide resources and support.37This placed the Shanghai authorities in a bind. They had turned a blindeye over previous weeks to the formation of rebel groups within individualfactories, even though Beijing had reiterated the prohibition against such

MOBILIZING A NATION39activities only weeks before.Now, however, they were faced with demandsfor the recognition of a citywide alliance of such groups—something thatwent far beyond Beijing's policies. The Mayor phoned officials in Beijingabout the demands,and theyinformed him that alliances ofworkers acrossfactories were still prohibited. The Mayor then refused to meet any of theworkers'demands. On November 9, Wang Hongwen led several thousandof his alliance's members to the city's party headquarters to press for rec-ognition of their group. Receiving no response, they decided to boardBeijing-bound trains en masse to petition national authorities for approvaloftheirdemands.38This action precipitated a standoff that required intervention by the Bei-jing authorities and that led to a shift in official policy. The large delega-tion of rebel workers departed on November 10, overwhelming trainsbound for Beijing. Thousands walked along the tracks and eventuallyblocked the rail lines near a station in the Shanghai suburbs.Beijing au-thorities, alarmed by the disruption of a major railway line, had Chen Boda,thehead oftheCentralCulturalRevolution Group,send a telegram toShanghai declaring that the blocking of rail traffic was forbidden, that theworkers'alliance was illegal, and that they should not travel to Beijing. Theworkers refused torelent,declaring the telegram a forgery.The next dayanother member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, Zhang Chun-qiao (who had until recently been the head of the Shanghai Party Com-mittee's Propaganda Department),was sent toShanghai to convince theworkers to drop their planned trip to Beijing. In the course of the negotia-tions, Zhang instead agreed to their demands in return for their agreementto go back to work. The agreement recognized the legality of the WorkersGeneral Headquarters, granted official support for its activities, and blamedthe crisis on the Shanghai Party Committee.39Zhang's actions surprised other leaders in Beijing and prompted a de-bate about the consequences of his action,but Mao quickly expressed sup-port. The question then became whether the Shanghai agreement appliedto the rest of the country. Officials in charge of the industrial economy ar-gued vehemently that making this a general policy would rapidly disruptthe economy. Mao was not persuaded and decided to rescind the prohibi-tion on worker participation in rebel groups. The resulting 10-point direc-tive, issued December 9, finally gave official sanction to worker rebels, butit tried to limit potential disruptions to the economy. The document did40AGENTS OF DISORDERnot explicitly sanction citywide coalitions of worker rebels,but for the firsttime it made clear that workers could form independent groups.40By the time this document was issued,it had already fallen behind de-velopments elsewhere. In Nanjing, worker rebels opposed to city authori-tiesimitatedthe actionsoftherebelworkersinnearbyShanghai.Theydemanded recognition of their alliance on November 14,only days afterZhang Chunqiao agreed to the Shanghai rebels' demands.After the Nan-jingcityandJiangsuprovinceauthoritiesfailedtorespondtotheirdemands,they sent a delegation to Beijing to seek support. On November 16, ZhouEnlai agreed to their demands (Mao already having approved the Shanghaiagreement).41 Alliances of worker rebels spread to other major cities inDecember. This opened the door to larger and more threatening rebel in-surgencies, especially in cities with large industrial sectors.LoyalistCountermobilizationLocal political authorities, targeted by incipient rebel movements, wereforbiddenfrom using the security services or armed forces to resist studentand worker rebels. Any moves to protect themselves from rebel threatswouldhavetotaketheformofcountermobilizationthatmimickedrebelinsurgencies. This took the form of nominally independent political organ-izations among workers and staff thatfrequently adopted an older andmoreorthodox term for“Red Guard,”commonly translated as“ScarletGuard”(chiwei dui).This term was used torefer toRed Guards that foughtfor the victory of theBolsheviks during the civil war in Russia.The termfor “Red Guard” invented by students early in the Cultural Revolution——"hongwei bing"—was entirely new and not based on standard usage. Theadoption of theolder term signaled a more orthodox stance of groups whoseaim was to“defend Red power."There were two common forms of Scarlet Guard mobilization.The firstwas widespread but relatively short-lived: Scarlet Guard brigades of loyalstaff within party-state organs. Their avowed purpose was to defend partyandgovernment officesfromincursionsby student andworkerrebels,andto protect their leaders from confrontations with them. The second devel-oped somewhat later and was limited to the major cities. This varietymobilized large numbers of industrial workers, utilizing the organizationalcapacity of the Communist Party and their subordinate trade unions in

This became much more disruptive, because it involvedlargenumbers ofworkerswholeft theirworkplaces toengagein streetpro-tests andconfrontationswithrebelforces.Theyeventuallyfedlocaldisorders,aftertheseScarletGuards turned against thelocal authorities.The first type of Scarlet Guards responded to rebels that staged protestsatpartyandgovernmentofficecompounds,andthatdeclaredtheirinten-tion to“drag out”the topleaders.A typical example was the reaction ofGuangxi provincial officials to the first sit-in protest by rebel students atthe party headquarters on September 9. Cadres and staff who worked thereformed Scarlet Guards“in order to protect the security of the regional partycommittee's compound, guard against Red Guard invasions of the offices,and preserve normal office operations."42Scarlet Guard organizations proliferated across Guangxi Province inSeptember 1966, and they were organized at all levels of the governmenthierarchy. They claimed to be rebel groups within party and governmentoffices,andtheyoccasionallyconfrontedstudentrebelswhotriedtoin-wade party and government offices.43 In Qinzhou Prefecture the party com-mitteeannouncedonAugust29,incompliancewithBeijing's directives.thatitwouldwithdrawallworkteamssenttoconductloyaltyinvestigations,butitalsocalledfortheestablishmentofScarletGuardsinadministrative units to protect offices and the documents they contained. Thehead of the prefecture's Public Security Bureau was put in charge of theeffort.44 In Wuming County, Scarlet Guards were established in early September, immediately after local Red Guards put up a wall poster declaringtheir intention to “burn alive” the county's party secretary. The heads ofthe county's Organization and Propaganda departments were put in chargeofScarlet Guard units,whose taskwas summarized as the“fourprotects":"protect Chairman Mao,protect the Party Center, protect the CulturalRevolution, and protect Party and government organs."45 Lingui Countyhad a militant student insurgency infuenced by Beijing student rebels. OnAugust 24, after rumors that a rebel group was preparing to invade theparty headquarters of nearby Guilin city, one of the county's leaders con-vened an urgent late-night meeting. Scarlet Guards were to confront thestudentrebels,treat them politely,but tell them firmly that there was noneed for them to meet with the county's leaders.46This type of Scarlet Guard activity was short-lived. This was exactly thekind of activity that was denounced at the October Party Work Conference42AGENTS OFDISORDERas a typical example of the “bourgeois reactionary line."After October itwas impossibleforlocalofficials to encourage such groups without openlydefying Beijing, and office workers who persisted in Scarlet Guard activitynowrisked accusationsthattheywere“reactionary.The second type ofScarlet Guard activity became more prominent afterOctober and grew rapidly in reaction to the permission granted rebelworkers toform cross-factory alliances.TheseScarlet Guardsweremobi-lized within workplaces, relying on party and trade union organizations,party members, and other politically loyal workers.47 They mobilizedworkersfor confrontations withrebelgroupsbothwithinlargeenterprisesandeventually onthecitystreets.ScarletGuardsinNanjinghad amajonimpact onevents thereinthelastmonthsof1966.Alreadyduringthefirstweek of September there was a violent clash in one of the city's districtsbetweenrebelworkers andScarletGuards—thefirstmentionof thisva-riety of countermobilization in Nanjing.48Nanjing's Scarlet Guard movement escalated during November in re-actiontotheroughtreatmentstudentrebelsmeted out totopofficialswhenthey were seized for interrogation and“struggle sessions."After rebels fromNanjing University captured and interrogated one of the provincial leadersduring the first week of November, workers from a large state factory putup wall posters denouncing its brutality.

A city-wideScarletGuardcoalitionwasformedonNovember19tocoordinateresistancetotherebels.This escalated the conflicts,andviolent confronta-tionscontinuedintomid-December.Although they were formed to defend the party establishment, the Nan-jing Scarlet Guards soon turned against the local authorities.

This was a re-pudiation of the Scarlet Guards, who responded by sending several thou-sand members to the provincial party headquarters, invading the officecompound, and demanding that provincial officials repudiate their agree-mentwith therebels.A crowdof morethan10,oooScarlet Guards assem-

After the WorkersGeneralHeadquarterswontheirdemandsforrecognitioninmid-November, the Scarlet Guards spread rapidly. They distributed handbillsdenouncing the rebels for disrupting rail traffic and stranding thousandsof student Red Guards who were on the trains. Angered by the outcome ofthisconfrontation,whichendedwith theShanghaiofficials cavingin toall demands, the party and union organizations of state factories began tomobilize workers to“protect the Shanghai party committee."Relying on the existing infrastructure of the party and official tradeunions, Shanghai's Scarlet Guards grew with astonishing speed. Immedi-ately after theWorkers'General Headquarters won their battlefor recog-nition,Scarlet Guardspoppedupall across the city,andwere strongestinfactories that had large rebel movements. The Scarlet Guards held a meetingtoplanfor acitywideallianceonNovember23,andtwoweekslaterit al-ready claimed 200,000members.At their December 6founding rallythere were an estimated 300,000 in attendance. By the end of Decemberthey claimed80o,000in a totalworkforceof2.7million.This remarkablyrapid expansion, which contrasted with the long and slow struggle by rebelworkers tobuild their organization, attested to the effectiveness of partyand tradeunion structures inmobilizing a countermovement.Althoughinitiallyintendedtoprotectlocalauthorities,Shanghai'sScarlet Guards, like their counterparts in Nanjing, eventually turnedagainst them.Despite clear signs that Mao and hisradical associates fa-vored the rebels,the Scarlet Guards objected that the Shanghai Party Committee was coerced into signing agreements. They turned out huge num-bers for large street confrontations with rebel workers in December,disrupting factories and transportation networks to a degree that rebel ac-tivities alonecouldnothave achieved.TheydemandedthattheShanghaiauthorities recognize them also and repudiate agreements earlier signedwiththerebels.Theypressed thesedemandswith a massive demonstration44AGENTS OF DISORDERat the party headquarters in mid-December. The Shanghai authorities couldnot comply, because the rebel alliance had the clear backing of Beijing.Open support for theScarlet Guards would further implicate them in a"bourgeois reactionary line.” The Scarlet Guards then turned against theShanghai authorities,staging large demonstrations at theparty headquartersthattouchedofftheconfrontationswithrebelsthatledtothecollapseand overthrow of the Shanghai Party Committee in early January.50CadreRebelsAfinaltypeofmobilizationdevelopedmuchlaterthanalloftheothers,and until recently has been almost entirely neglected in research on thisperiod—rebel movements among party and government functionaries.51 Aswe shall see, this type of mobilization played a decisive role in the nation-wide collapse of party-state structures and in the subsequent factional con-flicts that raged across China for more than a year afterward. At firstglance, rebel bureaucrats would appear to be something of a contradictionin terms—especially if one conceives of rebellions as popular movementsagainst states. As an interest group, party-state officials had vested inter-ests in defending their organizations from rebel attacks, and in preservingthe structures to which their relatively privileged positions were ostensiblytied.TheScarletGuardsthatformedwithingovernmentofficesinSep-tember expressed this fact.Yet in the wake of the mounting nationwidecampaign to target top officials for carrying out the“bourgeois reactionaryline,” individual bureaucrats turned against their superiors in growing num-bers, forming rebel groups that repudiated their superiors.Cadres in party-state organs began to criticize the “bourgeois reactionaryline”carriedoutby theirsuperiorsshortly after theOctoberPartyCon-ference in Beijing. In Zhejiang Province, a mass meeting was held onOctober 21 to denounce the actions of the provincial Cultural RevolutionCommittee.At a mass meeting attended by more than 8,ooo office per-sonnel who worked in more than 60 provincial departments, 45 “revolu-tionary cadres" from 22 provincial party and government organs read outtheir denunciations of the province's“bourgeois reactionary line." The criti-cisms focusedon theofficialinchargeoftheprovince'sCulturalRevolu-tion Committee, and the mass meeting was attended by many of the prov-ince's top officials.52 Following the mass meeting, organizations of rebels

MOBILIZING A NATION45who worked in party and government offices (referred to as jiguan zaofanpai) spread across the province,and held some 850 mass meetings with atotal of more than 30,000 in attendance.53 This kind of officially sponsoredactivity, a clear reaction to therecently concluded October party conference, was designed to cast blame on specific individuals within the regionalleadership. But as rebel bureaucrats began to mobilize on their own in thefollowing weeks, it would eventually prove impossible for top officials tocontrol the process of accusation and to limit blame to a small handful ofscapegoats.Theidea thatbureaucratsmightrebel againsttheir own superiorswasnot entirely absent from the thinking of the Cultural Revolution's spon-sorsinBeijing.Theyhad,from thebeginning,encouragedbureaucrats toexposetheirsuperiorsforrevisionistor anti-Maoattitudesandbehavior.In the first days of 1967, Mao Zedong himself emphasized the crucial roleof cadres in aiding the rebel movement: “The Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution in party and government organs is very important. If. .. thecadres in party and government organs do not actively throw themselvesinto the Cultural Revolution,it will not succeed. There are many important problems that can only be revealed by the cadres."54 Mao appears tohave had in mind the ability of cadres to expose inside information aboutthebehavior oftopofficials thatwasinaccessibletostudents or workersFrom this perspective, cadres could be indispensable allies of outside rebelgroups in their efforts toexpose the allegedpolitical crimes of top officialsIn many cities that had large popular insurgencies, this is exactly the rolethatrebel cadres would play.But therebel movements withinparty-stateagencies went significantly beyond this conception, and it is unclear whetherMaowas aware atthetimehemadethisstatementthatthecadrerebellionhad already advanced far across China over the previous month.Rebel cadres played a major role in the collapse and eventual over-throw of the Shanghai Party Committee.A December rebellion by ahigh-profile “writing group” in the Shanghai Party Committee Propa-ganda Department—described as “literati rebels" in one account of theperiod—has long been considered a key development in the crumbling ofthe Shanghai leaders? authority.?? But well before this group's public de-nunciation of Shanghai's top officials, there was an active rebel movementin“party and government organs."An authoritative history of Shanghai'sCultural Revolution describes this internal rebel movement as a crucial46AGENTS OF DISORDERbreakthrough.Without aninternalrebellionwithintheShanghaiparty andgovernment headquarters the contest between the rebels and Scarlet Guardswouldlikelyhaveendedinstalemate.56Theinternalrebelliongrewafterthe establishment of theWorkers'General Headquarters,and especiallyafter the issuance in early December of the document that signaled an ap-proval of rebel movements within factories and other workplaces.As theinternal rebelliongainedforce,it shook the resolve of topofficials,sappingtheir abilitytowithstandthedemandsofrebelstudents andworkers,anditunderminedtheir authority overtheirownsubordinates.When in mid-December one of Shanghai's ranking party secretaries de-clared his support for the rebel cause and the writers’ group openly chal-lenged their superiors, cadres at lower ranks in the party apparatus reconsid-ered their positions, and rebel groups expanded rapidly within variousdepartments.But thiswas just thelast andmostpublicmanifestation of arebellion of lower-ranking bureaucrats that had slowly grown over the pre-vious weeks. On December 16 these rebel bureaucrats held a large meetingto coordinate theformation of an alliance——themainleaders were cadres inthe editorial committee of a local party magazine, the Propaganda Depart-ment,andthe administrative officeoftheShanghaiPartyCommitteeitself.The cadre rebellion began even earlier in Nanjing. On November 14,rebel bureaucrats from the city's youth league offices entered the party head-quarters to recruit rebels in the Finance Bureau,post office,and the ad-ministrative office of the city government.They formed rebel groups acrossa range of party and government departments and held a mass meeting todenounce the Nanjing Party Committee. They declared their intention totake control over the party's archives and to supervise the activities of themunicipalparty secretariat.OnNovember18,close to500cadreswhohadbeen conducting a purge campaign in suburban villages returned to thecity to denounce that campaign as an expression of the bourgeois reac-tionaryline.OnNovember 24,several hundredof them assembled at theprovincial party headquarters to denounce top officials, and they seized aVice-Mayor and forced him to accompany them to Beijing. A coalition ofrebel bureaucrats in provincial organs was established on December 5, andrebels inside the city organs followed suit on December 9. On December 20,the latter coalition held a mass meeting at a stadium to denounce the cityauthorities. The rebel cadres intensified their activities until the provincialand city authoritieswere overthrown inlate January.57

MOBILIZING A NATION47Inside Guangxi's provincial party organs in Nanning, the earliest rebelgroups formed in late November in the Organization and Propaganda De-partments. By mid-December a reputedly “large majority” of the cadreswho worked in the provincial party headquarters had joined rebel groups.Even the staff office of the Provincial Party Committee, which served theparty secretariat, was riddled with rebelsthere were no fewer than eightsmall fighting groups, many of which had only a handful of members. OnDecember 11 more than 20 fighting groups in the provincial party andgovernment offices formed a coalition of rebel cadres in the provincial or-gans, with its headquarters in the Propaganda Department. They proceededwith a campaign to denounce the top provincial leaders for carrying outthebourgeoisreactionaryline.58Internal insurgencies by cadres spread across the party-state hierarchyin Guangxi.After theBeijing authorities issued the document approvingthe formation of rebel groups in factories and other workplaces, Nanning'smunicipal party secretary issued instructions to organs under the city'sparty andgovernment that extended this authorization to their cadres andsupport staff. Rebel organizations and small “fighting groups” soon mobi-lized within the city's bureaucracy to criticize the NanningParty Committee for its complicity with the bourgeois reactionary line. In mid-December the cadre rebels convened a large meeting of all cadres in thecity's administration to hear the party secretary's self-criticism, and the fol-lowing week they joined with student and worker rebels in a mass strugglesession against the city's top officials.59The cadre rebellions spread into Guangxi's prefectures and even ruralcounties. Cadre rebellions appeared as early as mid-October in the officesof Qinzhou Prefecture, and they continued to plague local authorities asthey gained strength in December.? By late November county-level cadreswere also focking to newly formed rebel“fighting groups”that aimed crit-icism at their own superiors. By the end of November, in the 29 govern-ment offices and departments inLingui County, there were more than 50small fighting groups with a membership of 520 out of the county's 883cadres and support staff.61 Fusui County had more than 80 rebel organ-izations, 22 of them in various county party and government offices, in-cluding the party's Organization Department, the party committee's staffoffice, and the Propaganda Department.62 In Tiandong County, cadres andstaff organized a number of fighting groups and one cross-department48AGENTS OF DISORDERalliance thathadmorethan100members.Ledby cadresfrom thepublicsecurity bureau, discipline inspection commission, and the court system,it coordinated the cadres rebellion against their superiors.63 In PubeiCountytheScarletGuardsturnedontheirmasters,reinventingthemselvesas a rebel group devoted to repudiating the bourgeois reactionary line—an attempt to absolve themselves for their earlier support of it.64The last half of 1966 saw an unprecedented level of political mobilizationboth within the state bureaucracy and in society at large. Most visible wasthe spread of the Red Guard and rebel movements, the first becoming al-most ubiquitous across China bySeptember, and the second spreading moreslowly and becoming widespread only after October.After permission wasgranted to industrial workers and other employees to form their own organ-izations and take part in rebel activities in early December, rebel groupsformed quickly in workplaces and cross-city alliances of worker rebels beganto appear. This greatly increased the scale and potential disruptiveness oftherebel campaign.Rebel activity sparked active countermobilization by those who soughtto blunt their impact.Within workplaces and government offices,“ScarletGuard"organizations formed to protect their organizations from rebel dis-ruptions and to shield their leaders from rebel attacks. In some majorcities, like Shanghai and Nanjing, Scarlet Guards in the industrial sectorspread rapidly, utilizing the authority of party organizations and officialtrade unions to rapidly mobilize large numbers, perhaps reluctantly, to con-front rebels. Street battles between these opposed groups disrupted publicorder andreducedlocalauthoritiestopowerlessness.Finally,byDecemberit appeared that officials and staffwithin party and government offices wererapidly defecting to the rebel cause.Rebel groups dedicated to the denun-ciation of their own superiorsinparty-state organsbegan toform on alargescale.One way of gauging the overall scale of this activity during this periodis to trace the number of reported victims of these various forms of political mobilization.An important, if not sole purpose of much of thispolitical mobilization was to identify and punish individuals who had al-legedly revisionist if not“anti-party” political leanings. A“victim” is someonewho is accused of revisionist orreactionary political leanings, subjected toMOBILIZINGANATION

Authorities-----InsurgentsFigure 2.3.Cumulative Number of Reported Victims of Insurgents and AuthoritiesMay1966-January196750AGENTS OF DISORDERpolitical authorities leveled off after it reached 126,000 in September andincreased only slightly afterward.The apparent halt in victimization bypo-litical authorities surely refects Beijing's condemnation of the “bourgeoisreactionaryline”inOctober,whichundercut activities controlledby re-gional and local officials.One might suspect that officially published sources would tend to ex-aggerate the impact of insurgent activity, while concealing the damagecaused by officials, and this may be true to some extent. But existing schol-arshiponthisperiod,whichdraws on an array ofinterviews,memoirs,and documentary sources, makes clear that officially organized loyalty in-vestigationsweremorefocusedthanRedGuardandrebelactivity.In-deed,by all accounts,in the early months of this period the authoritiesstruggled to contain violent Red Guard and rebel activity, and to narrowits scope.These same authorities wouldlaterbe condemnedfor their ef-forts to contain student and worker insurgencies and limit the number ofvictims.These trendlines are consistent withwhatweknowfrom othersources.66 Another consideration is that these same official sources, as weshall see, reported vastly more victims at the hands of authorities than in-surgents near the end of the period of mass mobilization.Anothernotablefeature ofFigure 2.3is that therapidrisein thenumberof victims tapers off after September.Theinitial wave of Red Guards broadlytargetedlower-statusauthorityfiguresandlargenumbersofindividualswith historical ties to politically stigmatized households. The rise of therebel movement, which first appeared in September, meant that attacks byinsurgent groupsbecameincreasinglyfocused on a muchmorerestrictedgroup of ranking officials in all localities (and perhaps also that insurgentshad exhausted the potential supply of lower-ranking targets). Not untilDecember 1966 did the number of thosevictimized by insurgents resumean upward climb, due to escalating attacks on local authorities. The shifttoward rebel attacks on authorities, increasingly focused on the way thattheyhad carried out their loyalty campaigns, also accounts for the apparenthalt in victimization by the authorities, who increasingly were put on thedefensive in the final months of 1966. How far had these trends, so pro-nounced in major cities like Shanghai and Nanjing, spread across Chinaby the end of 1966? And to what extent had local insurgencies developedtothepointwheretheyseriouslyunderminedpoliticalauthorities?3THEPACEOFREBELINSURGENCIES

THE POLITICAL MOBILIZATION THAT swept across China inthe last half of 1966 suggests a nation in turmoil. But the descriptive accounts in Chapter 2 draw on developments in selected locations, with themost dramaticfrom provincial capitals.Accounts in local histories suggestthat through the end of 1966 most local governments were not similarlydisrupted.HereI will examine this issue in more depth:how far had rebelinsurgencies developed prior to 1967, and how serious were the challengesthey presented to authorities?As we shall see, the dramatic upheavals ex-perienced in major cities like Shanghai and Nanjing were very unusual, anduntil the end of 1966—the eve of the early 1967wave of power seizuresthat overthrew local governments—rebel insurgencies remained small,poorly organized, and highly fragmented, and they were very late indeveloping.StatisticalPatternsStatisticalpatternsthat summarize accounts inlocal annals help us tracethe scale and impact of local insurgencies. Whatever their overall impact,we should expect that they were likely to be more developed and morethreatening to local officials in urban than in rural areas. There are largedifferences between cities and counties in the size and concentration of thepopulations that generated early rebel insurgencies. The cities had much

5152AGENTSOF DISORDERlarger and more concentrated populations,and much larger numbers of thestudents andworkerswhopropelledtheearlyrebelinsurgencies.Themore than170cities in our database contained an average ofjustover 500,000 people and 140,000 salaried workers. Twenty of the largestcities hadpopulations in excess of1 million,and ten of themhad morethan half a million salaried workers. On average, two thirds of their resi-dents were concentrated inurban districts,while the restlived on collec-tive farms in the nearby suburbs.1 The counties are a striking contrast.Fewerthan 9 percent of their residents lived in urban settlements, primarily inthe county seat.The rest were scattered widely across collective farms, mostof which were far from the county's party and government headquarters.The average county had a total population of more than 311,000 residents,butfewer than 23,000urbanresidents and 6,500 salaried employees.Thestudent populations were much smaller——in most cases they were limitedtoafewhundredjunior andseniorhighschool students.Thepopulationscapable of supporting significant rebel insurgencies in most county seatswereverysmall——inmostcasesmuchsmallerthantheworkforceofasingleindustrial complex in a large city.There are several types of events that might indicate the degree to whichthe local party and government authorities were seriously challenged byrebel activity.Thefirst is aninvasion of thelocalgovernmentheadquartersby rebel groups as part of a protest, whether or not the invasion was fol-lowed by a prolonged occupation.The second is the seizure of at least oneparty or government leader by rebels for denunciation at a mass meetingor any other purpose, whether or not the individual was subsequently heldcaptive.The third is thefirst mention of an alliance of student or workerrebels for the purpose of confronting local authorities. Together, these threetypes of events provide a broad sense of the extent to which local govern-ments were challenged, the degree to which the personal security of leaderswasthreatened,andthescaleandlevelof coordinationoflocalrebelactivity.PreviouslyItracedtimetrendsforthepercentageofalllocaljurisdictions that reported the presence of any kind of Red Guard or rebel activity.Theseactivitieswere sowidelyreportedby the endof1966that therewaslittle concern about the underreporting of events in local annals.

In other words, the aggregate trends that Ireportherearefairlyconfidentestimatesofthemaximumlikelyimpact ofrebelactivityduringthelasthalfof1966.OfficeInvasionsThe first indicator is an action that targeted party and government of-fices.

There are vast differences across jurisdictions:while close to 67 percent of provincial capitals reported an office invasionby the end of 1966, only 40 percent of prefecture-level cities had done so,and only 25 percent of county-level cities.Rebel office invasions were ex-tremely rare in counties—slightly more than 10 percent of those that re-ported such an activity did so before the end of 1966.

When such treatment was suffered by the top officials in a cityor county, this was a clear indication that a rebel campaign had begun toshakethelocalpowerstructure.

First Reported Appearance of Rebel Coalitions, by Month, 1966(N = 155)represents a level of organization and coordination that could result inlarger and more threatening collective action against local party and gov-ernment authorities. It therefore provides us with a marker of the scale andlevelof organizationof rebelinsurgencies and thepotential threattheyrepresent aschallengers tolocalauthorities.Figure 3.3 traces pronounced differences across jurisdictions in thetiming of the first reported rebel alliance, and it suggests clearly that bythe end of 1966, the rebel insurgencies were still relatively unorganized andfragmented outside of China’s provincial capitals. The first appearance ofa local rebel alliance was recorded in a total of 1,066local annals,but only155 of these reports were during 1966.Almost 67 percent of provincialcapitalsreported rebel alliances by the end oftheyear,butthepercentagefallssteadily as we move to lower levels in the political hierarchy, dropping tosome12percentforthecounties.These quantitative patterns in local annals are, to be sure, only roughindicators of fairly complex patterns of local events.The three trends thatI have described provide a summary sketch of the development of local rebelinsurgencies over time. They do not convey anything about what happened

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES57after thefirst event,or thefrequency and depth of the event's impact.Theydo tell us one thing that is very important—that these signature events hadnot occurred at all in a great many places by the end of 1966, and that onlythe largest cities, especially provincial capitals, were beginning to be seri-ouslyaffected.VariationinLocalNarrativesWhat dothesedifferenceslooklikein concrete terms?Toconveya morenuancedunderstandingofthevariedscaleandimpactofrebellion acrossjurisdictions,I will sketch capsule summaries of events up to the end of1966 across four different levels of China’s state hierarchy: provincial capi-tals, other prefecture-level cities, county-level cities, and county seats. Toensure that variation in these portrayals is not theproduct simply of dif-ferentlevels of detailinlocal annals,the narratives are drawn only fromthe longest and most detailed of the available accounts.As we shall see,there are many localities where it appears that little had occurred by theendof1966,andthatlocalauthoritieswerestilleitherfirmlyincharge orwere only beginning to be challenged by local rebels. In such case descrip-tions,this is notbecausethepublished narratives are short anduninfor-mative. It is because the vast majority of relevant political events describedin local annals took place only after the end of 1966.As we shall see, some of China's largest cities were deeply disrupted bythe end of 1966 and had already become ungovernable, with local authori-ties literally powerless to exercise authority or even to protect themselves.Other cities, and some counties, had only gone partway down this path.Many other jurisdictions, primarily small cities and counties, however, hadseen onlythebeginnings ofrebel activity,and somenone at all,with theauthorities stillvery much in control.The differences across jurisdictionswere in part due to their different demographic makeups——-large cities oftenhaddozensofuniversities andhundredsofhighschools outofwhich stu-dent rebellions could emerge, and they had hundreds of factories and sala-ried workforces that ranged from hundreds of thousands to well over a mil-lion.At the opposite extreme,the rural towns that often served as the seatsof county governments typically had only a handful of middle schools andsalariedurbanworkforcesthatnumberedinthehundredsorafewthousand. The consequences of these differences for the development of local58AGENTSOF DISORDERinsurgencies will become evident as I sketch a range of local cases, beginning with China's provincial capitals and ending with remote agrariancounties.ProvincialCapitalsIn 1966, China's provincial capitals averaged 1.3 million urban residentsand493,000salariedworkers.Thefourdescribedhere—Shanghai,Nan-jing, Guangzhou, and Nanning—range from China’s largest to the rela-tivelysmall.ExceptforShanghai,acitythatwas administrativelyequivalent to a province, provincial capitals were the home of two different levelsof government (province and city), and the headquarters of both were tar-geted by rebel insurgencies.3Shanghai.China’s largest city had an urban population of 6.4 millionand a salaried urbanworkforce of2.7millionin1966.4Therewere52,000students enrolledinits24institutionsofhigherlearning,and726,300stu-dents enrolled in its 519 middle schools.5 The first Red Guard organizationwas established onAugust 11 at FudanUniversity, and it eventuallyformedthecoreofa citywide allianceofuniversityrebelsknown astheRedRevo-lutionaries, an alliance that would play a central role in later developments.Others followed in quick succession later in August. A rebel orientation inthe Red Guard movement developed early, under the infuence of studentrebelsfromBeijing.The city was a magnet for traveling Red Guards:13,500of them arrived via train on just one day in mid-September, and more than4 million had visited by mid-December. On the last day of August, RedGuards from Beijing presented a list of demands to the Shanghai PartyCommittee. After receiving no response, they demonstrated at the partyheadquarters anddemandedthatthecity'sleaderscomeouttoheartheircriticisms. They tried to force their way into the building but were rebuffedafter a violent confrontation with staff and workers.This“August 31 Inci-dent” turned into a cause celebre for the student rebel movement—a symbolof the reactionary nature of the Shanghai Party Committee. Handbills crit-ical of the student radicals appeared in the name of Shanghai's workers,and the party and tradeunion organizations of factoriesmobilizedveteranworkers to go to the Shanghai Party headquarters to protect the building.Thefirstlocal alliance of studentrebels that defiedtheShanghai authori-ties’right tosupervise their political activitieswasformed onSeptember 29

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES59The first citywide alliance of university rebels appeared on October 12, anditeventuallyturnedintothelargest student organizationinthecity,theRed Revolutionaries. It became the dominant student alliance in Shanghaipublishing its own newspaper that by the end of the year had aprint run of800,oo0 copies.Twomore alliances ofuniversityrebels wereformed onNovember 3 and November 22.By end of year there were more than 5,400separatestudentrebelgroupsinShanghai.Duringthelasthalfof October,duetotheinfuenceof studentsre-turningfrom tripstoBeijing,the student movement turned decisivelyagainst the Shanghai authorities. Their primary demand was that theShanghai Party Committee must turn over “black lists”of students classi-fied astroublemakers by work teams sentinto schoolsinJune andJuly.Theauthorities balked at turning over their confidential files, arguing that theirrelease would spur retaliation against student informers and create deeperconflicts among students. During November, rebel students invaded officesinuniversitiesinsearchofthesefiles,andsoonturnedtheirattentiontotheShanghai Party Committee, which had organized the work teams and wheremany of thefiles were transferred after work teams were withdrawn.8After the confrontation over the recognition of the Workers? GeneralHeadquartersinmid-November,rebel students shiftedfromdemands toinspectthefilestotheoverthrowof theShanghaiPartyCommittee.Thestudent rebellion continued to grow, while theWorkers'General Headquar-ters rapidly expanded and aggressively confronted Shanghai's Mayor anditsPartySecretarywith a seriesofdemands.InlateNovemberthestudentrebel alliance, the Red Revolutionaries, demanded that their newspaper bedistributed along with the party's local newspaper, Liberation Daily. Aftenthis demand was refused, the students invaded the newspaper's offices andhalted its publication. The occupation continued into the next week, duringwhich the Workers'General Headquarters declared its support for the oc-cupation, and the nascent Scarlet Guards, who pulled together their city-wideallianceonDecember 4,senthundredsofworkerstosurroundthebuilding and force their way in, touching off a violent confrontation. Theoccupation of the paper's premises was not resolved until December 6, bywhich point the lines of conflict between Shanghai's student and workerrebels andtheScarletGuardshadhardened.As the confrontations between these groups escalated, the Shanghaiauthorities were helpless in the face of their conficting demands and60AGENTSOF DISORDERincreasingly violent street confrontations. The authorities had alreadyenteredintoagreementsthatrecognizedthedemandsoftherebelworkers,and they could not agree toScarlet Guard demands that theyrepudiatethem, fearing a backlash by the Workers' General Headquarters, who hadclear backing from Beijing. They warned the Scarlet Guards that theirorganizationshouldbedisbanded,but thisdidlittlemorethanturn thatgroup against them.The Scarlet Guards mobilized 20,000 of their mem-bers on December 12 to demand the repudiation of the agreement with therebel workers. They also demanded recognition of their alliance, the pro-vision of assistance andcooperation on anequalbasiswith theWorkersGeneral Headquarters, and an official apology.10Shanghai's leaders could not comply——this was precisely the period whenrebels within the city's bureaucracy were turning against them.After it be-came clear that theywerebeing cast asideinfavor oftherebel workers,theScarletGuardsmobilized anestimated30,0o0workersfor a massrallyinPeople's Square on December 23. During the rally, they forced Shanghai'sMayor to sign a formal agreement acceding to their demands. Before thedocumentcouldbepublished,Shanghai'sPartySecretary called anemer-gency meeting of the Party Committee and repudiated the pact.!lThe Scarlet Guards then decided to send a large delegation to Beijing tolodge a complaint, and on December 27 an estimated 30,000 of them as-sembled at theShanghaiPartyHeadquarters todemand a reinstatementof their agreement with the Mayor. They remained there for several days,leadingtoaviolentconfrontationwithrebelworkerswhosurroundedthem.These events touched off sporadic fighting between Scarlet Guard and rebelgroups across the city, in the streets and in schools and factories. Close to10,0ooScarletGuardsthensetofftoboardtrainsforBeijing,withmanyof them marching along the tracks. When they reached a station in thenearby suburbs, a large contingent of worker rebels, arriving in a convoy oftrucks loaded with their activists, intercepted them and another violent clashfollowed, again blocking railway traffic in and out of Shanghai. As the yearended,hundredsofthousandsofScarlet Guards andrebelworkershadlefttheir jobs to engage in protests and street battles with their opponents, andthe city's transportation networks and many large enterprises had ground toa halt. The impact on the city was similar to a general strike. Shanghai's PartyCommittee and government had completely lost control and were helpless inthe face of two large and violently opposed popular movements.12

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES61Nanjing. Jiangsu's provincial capital, 190 miles by rail from Shanghaiwas disrupted in similar, if not quite so dramatic a fashion.Nanjing hadanurbanpopulation of close to1.7million in1966,and573,000salariedworkers and staff.Ithad108,000students enrolled in147middle schools,and 30,000 students in 19 universities.13 With a large student populationand industrial workforce, the city was a hotbed of rebel activity.14 TheJiangsu Province and Nanjing city authorities were both beleaguered byrebel confrontations as early as September, and by December they hadalmostcompletelylostcontrolofthecity.Office invasions at the provincial and municipal government headquar-ters began in early September. On September 9 more than 3,000 studentrebelsinvaded and occupiedseveral offices attheProvincialPartyhead-quarters and began a hunger strike.The first large coalition of Red GuardsformedinearlyOctober,and asecondbroad allianceformedthefirstweekof November. Top provincial officials soon found themselves at the mercyof rebel groups. On October 10 rebels from Nanjing University attackedthe provincial party offices, demanding that a member of the party secre-tariatbeturned over tothemforcriticism.They tookhim intocustody onOctober31 andpubliclyhumiliated him at a massmeetingonNovember 2,wherehewasbeaten andforcedtokneelbeforeabust of ChairmanMaoto“askforgiveness."OnOctober 29,studentrebelsinvaded andoccupiedtheofficesoftheJiangsuPartyCommittee,sealingupthe archiveswhilesearchingfor thefiles compiled by university work teams on rebel students. In mid-Novembera large student rebel alliance held a mass denunciation meeting againstJiang-su's First Party Secretary along with other members of the provincialparty secretariat, during which he was physically abused and lost conscious-ness.After another leader gave a public speech to apologize for the prov-ince's “bourgeois reactionary line,” rebel students judged his self-criticism“insincere” took him into custody, and escorted him forcibly to Beijing topleadtheircasewiththecentral authorities.InearlyDecembertheserebelstudents, who had forcibly taken yet another leading Jiangsu official to Bei-jing,obtained a decree from the Beijing authorities ordering the Jiangsuleaders to agree to all rebel demands. The most important of these was thatall political charges made against rebel students in June and July be off-cially withdrawn, and that all files kept on the rebels be removed from thearchives.62AGENTS OFDISORDERThe Nanjing city authorities were similarly beleaguered. In early Sep-tember, after repeated confrontations with rebel students and workers atthe Nanjing Party headquarters,some operations were shifted to a com-pound of the Bureau of Public Security for protection.After this move stu-dent rebels invaded the party headquarters repeatedly, and on October 12workerrebelsoccupiedthebuilding.StudentrebelsseizedaVice-Mayorand held him captive on their university campus near the end of November.In mid-December, rebel students invaded the city's party headquarters andassumedcontrolofitstelephoneswitchboard,controllingitsabilitytocom-municatewithdistrictandneighborhoodofficials.Beginning in lateNovember, and continuing through the middle ofDecember, the Nanjing authorities tried to defuse local antagonisms bysending ranking officials to factories to read self-criticisms for carrying outthe “bourgeois reactionary line." They apologized for their prior actions andretracted all charges against workers lodged earlier in the fall. A memberof theparty secretariat went repeatedly to theYangzi River MachineWorkstoread aself-criticism onbehalfofthecity authorities.After the third time,rebel workers hauled him off toBeijing.With both the provincial and city governments paralyzed by office in-vasions and kidnappings of top offcials, matters worsened when ScarletGuards, composed of industrial workers,began to fight back against therebels.They had begun to resist rebel attacks on provincial and municipalleaders asearly asOctober,butinlateDecember,angeredthat the authori-ties had repeatedly caved in to all rebel demands, they turned against theJiangsu authorities and also accused them of carrying out a “bourgeois re-actionary line." On December 21, they held a mass meeting to denounceand“crush” the Jiangsu authorities, demanding that they repudiate all prionagreementswiththerebels,especiallytheirconfessionthattheyhadcon-spired with Scarlet Guards. Unable to induce the authorities to repudiatethese agreements, thousands of them assembled at a major railway terminusontheYangziRiver onDecember25andsetofftolodgetheircomplaintsinBeijing.Morethan10,oo0reached arailwaystationinnorthernJiangsubefore the trains werehalted,where most were convinced to return toNan-jing.After their return,streetbattles erupted betweenrebels andScarletGuards, disrupting transportation networks and paralyzing the city. As1966 ended, Nanjing was in disarray, with political authority having van-ishedentirely.

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES63Guangzhou. Guangdong's provincial capital had a large and activerebelmovement,butitdevelopedmoreslowlythaninShanghai andNan-jing.15 By the end of theyear it had not seriously undermined local authorityto the same extent. Guangzhou had an urban population of 2.2 million in1966,and a salariedworkforce of closeto900,00o.16Ithadmore than110,000students enrolled inits107middle schools,and 21,000studentsenrolled in its 14 universities and colleges.17 The city's large Red Guardmovement showed a rebel orientation in early September, when the firstcitywide alliances of student rebels appeared. By mid-October there werethree separate Red Guard alliances. In late November and early Decembergroups of worker rebels formed in individual factories, but they did notformcitywide alliancesuntiltheveryendof 1966.Popularresistanceagainst rebel students’ violent campaign against remnants of the oldsociety——pedicab drivers, street vendors, and people with relatives in nearbyHong Kong—was expressed as resistance to outside troublemakers fromthe north, and factoryScarlet Guard organizations formed in response.Thefirstrecorded seizure ofarankingcity officialby studentrebelswasonSeptember 5,and thefirst cross-city alliances of student rebels appearedat the end of October. Despite the growing scale and organization of thestudent movement, the provincial and city governments still operated. Theprovincial party committee convened a large cadre conference in early No-vember without incident, at which they discussed the implications of therecentOctoberPartyConference.BylateNovember,however,thesecurityoftheprovincialandcity authorities deteriorated. On November 23, a large force of student rebels in-vaded the office compound of the provincial party committee, and theydidsotwicelaterthatweekinsearchoffileskept onindividualspunishedby the work teams.These materials were used as evidencein mass ralliesheld on December 11 and 14 to denounce the provincial party commit-tee's bourgeois reactionary line. On December 13 rebels invaded and shutdown the two local party newspapers. This stimulated counterprotests or-ganized by trade unions in largefactories.More than one thousand workersdemonstrated at the newspapers'offices to protest the closing of the papers,shouting slogans declaring their intention to “protect the Party Center andChairmanMao."The newspapers'closings unleashed simmering resentment against out-siders, especially among party members and members of trade unions,64AGENTS OFDISORDERbecause the actionwasled byradical students fromBeijing.OnDe-cember 22,this came to a head at the newspapers’offices,where morethan 2,0o0 people gathered to protest the shutdown. When one of the stu-dentmilitants attempted tomake a speech,the crowdbeathimbadly.Thenext day another crowd of equal size destroyed a student propaganda truckthatbroadcast slogans over a loudspeaker.At yet another confrontation atthe newspaper offices on December 25, an angry crowd overturned a pro-paganda van, resulting in one death and eight severe injuries. The incidentcrystallized popular resentment against student radicals, especially thosefrom the north, and on January 2 two alliances, one of workers, one of stu-dents,formed out of those who opposed the closing of the paper. In re-sponse, students who supported the closing of the paper formed an alli-ance of their own. In the final two weeks of December the foodgatesopened,and rebel organizations were formed in workplaces across thecity—both in factories and within the provincial and city government of-fices. As 1966 drew to a close, Guangzhou was showing signs of the samedevelopments that were already far advanced in Shanghai and NanjingNanning.Guangxi's provincial capital was much smaller thanNan-jing and Guangzhou. Its urban population was close to 411,oo0, with153,000industrialworkers andstaff.18Therewereonly38middleschoolswithanenrollment ofcloseto23,000,andfewer than2,000 college stu-dents.19 It had a large and active student rebel movement, but worker rebelsdid not begin to mobilize until December.20 Rebels were able to extract aseries of apologies from local officials, but they had not yet underminedtheir authority or disrupted public order even in ways that approachedGuangzhou.Thefirst allianceofRedGuardswasformedonAugust25.Their activities had the approval of the city authorities, who gave them fa-vorable coverage in local newspapers.During September and October, theRed Guard movement was given a boost by more than 32,000 militantstudentswhovisitedNanningfromelsewhere.ThemostinfluentialofthesewereroughlyonethousandBeijingRedGuardswhoarrivedaspartof91delegations.Their activities escalated levels of violence against the victimsof home searches and struggle sessions. Their attacks soon turned againsttopofficials in theprovincial and cityleadership.The first rebel confrontation with party authorities was on September 9,when a group of Red Guards staged a sit-in protest at the offices of the Pro-vincial Party Committee to denounce its “reactionary line."21 In response

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES65to the threat,party and government departments,factories,and neighbor-hoods began to form Scarlet Guards to protect against the marauding stu-dents. These groups were active until early November, when they weredissolved after being denounced at the October Party Conference. The firstcitywide student rebel alliance was founded near the end of September, andin the coming weeks no fewer than 5 more large rebel alliances appeared.Thefirst direct challenge to the provincial and city leadership was an Oc-tober19wall poster that accused themof carrying out thebourgeois reac-tionary line by suppressing the student movement. The tide quickly turned,and the rebel movement gained energy. Large rebel rallies were held nearthe end of October, denouncing the provincial and city authorities.Manytop officials attended, making conciliatory speeches. On November 1, rebelsassembled at the city government offices to demand that heads of workteamsbeturnedovertothem.OnNovember22,thefirstalliance ofworkerrebels wasestablished ata mass meetingheld at theProvincialPartyheadquarters.Several provin-cial leaders gave speeches. One week later, the provincial leaders told cadresand staff in party and government organs that they had the right to formtheir own rebel groups, and they spread rapidly. In early December, theworker rebel alliance was expanded, reorganized, and renamed. Large massmeetings to denounce the provincial and city authorities were held in mid-December, with top offcials giving contrite and apologetic speeches. Atthe end of December, workers in the railway system and public bus linesformed rebel alliances and denounced the local authorities. The authorityof Nanning's leaders was rapidly evaporating, but public order had not yetdeteriorated to the extent it had in Shanghai, Nanjing, or Guangzhou.Prefecture-LevelCitiesThe prefecture-level cities were directly under the jurisdiction of pro-vincial governments. Excluding provincial capitals, they had an averageurban population of 350,594 and 121,100 salaried workers. The three citiesdescribed here—Qiqihaer, Qingdao, and Wuzhou——-range from the largeto therelativelysmall.22Eachof them had robust rebelmovements,but bythe end of the year none of them were as large, active, or threatening as theonesintheprovincialcapitalsIhavejustdescribed.Qiqibaer.This city in China’s northernmost province of Heilongjianghad an urban population of 957,068 and a state-sector workforce of66AGENTS OF DISORDER151,013.23Thecity's57middle schoolshad37,369students in theirlowerdivisions,and6,654inhighschool.Twocollege-levelinstitutes taughtcourses in industrial technology,andhad a total enrollment of1,498.24Thecity's rebel movement forced thereplacement of thelocal partyleadershipsurprisingly early, an accomplishment that appeared to satisfy the rebelsand stabilize party authority in the city.25 On August 6 the first rebel chal-lenge to the municipal party committee appeared in the form of a wallposter putup at thepartyheadquarters by studentsfromthelocal ma-chineryinstitute.It charged that theworkteamssent to theirinstitute hadcommittederrorsofpolitical line.Inmid-August,thecity'spartycom-mittee learned that students in that institute had seized the school's partysecretary and other officials, subjecting them to violent and humiliatingstruggle sessions. An official sent to the school by the Qiqihaer Party Com-mittee failed to convince them to stop, and it then issued a directive pro-hibiting similar rebel actions.When, on August 16,close to 700 studentsand others from the school paraded their party secretary in the streets,theywere surrounded and blocked by workers from nearby factories, who brokeup their procession. This became known as the“August 16 incident."Shortly afterwards,the students atthemachineryinstitute,defying thecityauthorities,pushedasidetheirschool'spartyleadershipandsetuptheinowncommitteetorun theCulturalRevolution.Dayslater,more than300rebelsfrom theprovincial capital'sHarbinIndustrial Institute disrupted amassmeetingunderway at alocalfactory.Theydenouncedthecity'sPartySecretary and other leaders.

The next day the Heilongjiang provincial authori-

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES67ties stepped in to remove Qiqihaer's First Party Secretary from his post. Ata mass meeting shortly afterwards in the city government's assembly hall,the deposed party secretary was denounced for his alleged political crimes.The city's Cultural Revolution Committee was reorganized to cooperatemorecloselywithlocalrebels.Attacks onleadingofficials continued,andon September 23 the remaining Secretaries on the Qiqihaer Party Com-mitteeallresigned.With the city's government already completely paralyzed by the end ofSeptember, Beijing sent in an offcial to stabilize the situation.The formerMayorwas denounced at amassrally,and on October1thefirstcitywidealliance ofrebel students was established.In early October,emissariesfrom Beijing met with rebel leaders to calm the situation, and a new tem-porary party leadership was established near the middle of the month.Near the end of October, the city's new leaders convened a mass rally ofrebels and denounced the “bourgeois reactionary line” carried out bytheirpredecessors.This unusually rapid overthrow of the city's leaders appears to have sat-isfied local rebels and stabilized the city until the year's end. In other cityannals, the months of November and December mark an upsurge of rebelactivity and often increasingly serious disruptions of local governments. InQiqihaer, however, little appears to have happened during these twomonths. In November, the student rebels divided into two opposed fac-tions, causing the collapse of an earlier alliance,but there are no reports offurther confrontations with the city's political leadership through the endo1966.

Qingdao.：This large seaport on Shandong Province's south coast hadanurbanpopulationof850,000 and aworkforceof366,718workers andstaff.26 The city had 175 middle schools with a total enrollment of 88,187,but only 2,987 students were enrolled in 3 university-level institutions.27The city had a large and active student rebel movement, and it engaged inspirited attacks on the city's party leadership, but by the end of the yeartheyhad not seriouslyundermined the city authorities.28Thefirst RedGuard protest at the offces of the Qingdao Party Committee was on Au-gust 24, when students from Qingdao Medical College demanded the re-moval of one of their school's Deputy Party Secretaries. The next day,workers confronted militant Red Guards on the streets. In response, a group68AGENTS OF DISORDERof students, blaming the workers' action on the local authorities, invadedtheofficesoftheQingdaoPartyCommittee.Thecity'sleadersreactedbyissuingadirectivethatcalledupon allworkers andcadrestorespectthestudent activists and not to attack or debate with them. Unappeased, anallianceofrebelstudentsfromvariouscollegesdenounced theQingdaoParty Committee for conspiring to incite violence against the studentmovement.Near the end of August more than a thousand student rebels from Bei-jing and the Shandong provincial capital of Ji'nan arrived to support at-tacks on the Qingdao party authorities. On August 28, the provincial partycommittee ordered Qingdao's Party Secretary to go to various colleges andmake aself-criticism.Whenhe didsothenextdayhewas subjectedto amass criticismmeeting,forcedtowear aduncecaponwhichwaswritten“counterrevolutionary oppressor of the revolutionary student movement,"and to wear a signboard that stated,“I am a counterrevolutionary." OnAugust 31, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, trying to placatethe students, removed him and appointed an acting Party Secretary forthecity.The next day workers and other citizens rallied at the gates of the Qing-daoPartyCommittee.Theydemanded thatthecity'sPartySecretaryberestored to his post, and that the student rebels be severely punished. Laterthat day more than10o,oo0 city residents demonstrated in the streets insupport, and an estimated 40,000 held sit-in protests at the party head-quarters and the city's assembly hall. On September 4, the Beijing authori-ties weighed in to defuse the situation, and ordered a halt to the quarrelsbetweenworkersandstudents.Maoconcludedthatthelocalauthoritieswere incitingworkers to oppose the student movement,and he ordered thepublication of a central party directive on September 11 that forbade theincitement of workers to oppose student rebels.29 Days later, Qingdao's stu-dentrebelsformedtheirfirstcitywidealliance.WiththepublicationofMao's directive,rebelworkersfromseveralfactorieswent to university cam-puses to declare their support for the students.The firing of Qingdao's PartySecretary, and the firm suppression of thecontroversysurroundinghim,appearedtotakethesteamoutoffurtherrebel attacks on the QingdaoParty leadership.Not until October13wasthere another reported protest at the city's party headquarters, when a del-egation of more than a thousand university students, returning by train

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES69from Beijing,went there to demonstrate. In late October, the city govern-ment estimated that there weremore than 490 separateRed Guard groupsin the city, with close to 23,600 members.Despite occasional disturbances,the reshufled Qingdao party leadership continued to operate normally,holding regular conferences through the end of the year. Worker rebels hadyet to form a cross-city coalition and did not yet play a significant role inlocal events. Having been firmly rebuked by Mao in early September, cit-izencountermobilizationindefenseofthelocalauthoritiesdisappeared,andthereisnomentionofworkerScarletGuards.Wuzhou.This city in Guangxi Province had an urban population of118,120 and anindustrialworkforce of 39,514.Ten middle schoolshad8,300 students in the junior divisions and 1,204 in high school. There wasno significant population of college students.30 The first challenge to thecity's leaders came from a group of rebel students from Guilin, anotherprefecture-level city in Guangxi, in early September, when they vowed tothrow Wuzhou into“great disorder."31 When the Guilin rebels traveled toschools andworkplaces around thecity,theyweremetbyScarletGuardsandlocalRedGuards,whostronglyobjectedto theirmessage.TheGuilinrebels denounced this as“suppressing the masses,”and some local activistsbegan to agree. Offcials in the city government put up wall posters de-nouncingoutsideagitators.The tide started to turn whenmore than 7oolocal students returnedfrom Beijing in mid-October and formed a rebel group that denounced theWuzhou Party Committee for suppressing the students. Responding to theOctober Party Conference in Beijing, the Wuzhou Party Committee is-suedaself-criticism on October 23.Therebelstudentspushedtheir ad-vantage and organized a series of mass meetings to denounce the city'sleaders. They denounced Scarlet Guards as tools of the “bourgeois reac-tionaryline.”Responding tothisturn of events,andrecognizing theim-plications of the OctoberParty Conference, theScarlet Guards disbandedinNovember.Manyofthemdistancedthemselvesfromtheirsuperiors andtheir earlier actions.They formed new rebel organizations that attackedlocal officials, demanding that they step down from their posts. Until theend of December, however, there was no broad rebel alliance opposed totheWuzhou Party Committee.Through theend of the year there were noreported seizures of city leaders or invasions of government offices.70AGENTS OF DISORDERCounty-LevelCitiesCounty-level cities, directly below prefectures or prefecture-level citiesin the national hierarchy, averaged 169,400 urban residents and 40,800salariedworkers.The threethat are described here—Shijiazhuang,Anshunand Beihai—were even less disrupted than the larger cities, and their rebelinsurgencies appearedvery late.32Shijiazhuang.This city in centralHebeiProvince was alsothe seat ofShijiazhuang Prefecture. It had 643,000 urban residents and 156,800 sal-aried employees, 91,300 of whom were industrial workers.33 Its 19 middleschoolshad14,909studentsintheirlowerdivisions and2,681intheirhighschool divisions.There were also5,253studentsin3university-levelinsti-tutions.34 The rebels targeted both prefecture and city governments.35 Thefirst wall poster to challenge the local authorities appeared very early, Au-gust 12,when students from a local university called on all students to"bombard the city party committee"” At the end of August, Red Guardsdemanded tobe let into government office buildings to read wall postersput up by their staff, but the city offcials refused. They next day they brokeinto the building and occupied the premises, forcing government staff outof their offices. The first citywide alliance of Red Guards was formed onSeptember 10, but the first alliance of rebel students did not appear untilmorethan onemonthlater,on October 25.The first group of worker rebels did not appear until early December. Aclashbetweenworker factions occurred at atextilemill onDecember 5,injuring more than 300 employees and causing considerable damage. Thisincidentled to the formation of a citywide coalition ofworker rebels onDecember 8.Just over one week later, two separate alliances of student andworker rebels declared their intention to“bombard”the city authorities.The first reported invasion of a government office was on December 25,when university students occupied the offices of the party newspaper, Shi-jiazhuangDaily.At this point in time,rebelgroups began toform withinparty and government offices:19 rebel groups in the prefecture's party of-fices established an allianceinDecember.The accounts for Shijiazhuang portray a rebel movement that developedmuch more slowly than in the larger cities. Unlike in some of the largercities, there were no reported seizures of top officials and no reported inva-sions of government offices until the newspaper's editorial offices were

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES71occupiednear theendoftheyear.Therewasnocitywide allianceofworkenrebels until mid-December, and the primary activities of rebel workers werelimited to workplace clashes with workers who were loyal to the factoryofficials. As 1966 came to an end, Shijiazhuang's rebels were only beginningtogatherstrength.Ansbun.This small cityin GuizhouProvince,whichserved as theseatofAnshunPrefecture,hadonly78,422urbanresidents,twomiddleschools,and no universities.36 During August students began to denounce the ac-tions of work teams sent into their schools.37 Red Guard organizations ap-peared,and the local authorities tried to keep ahead of their demands.OnSeptember 6, the city authorities organized a mass meeting attended by areported 30,000 students,workers, and cadres, at which the leaders of workteams were denounced and subjected to struggle sessions.Perhaps recognizing that militant students would be less threatening ifthey left the city, in early October the city's Party Committee began sendingdelegations of local Red Guards to Beijing and elsewhere at the city's ex-pense, and the majority of local students soon left. This had the effect ofstabilizing thepolitical situation until students returnedfrom their travelsinNovember,havingbeenradicalizedby theirexperiences andinspiredbythe directives of the OctoberParty Conference.Eventually,in late De-cember, the prefecture and city authorities were finally faced with rebelgroups that called for “kicking aside” local leaders. Top leaders of both theprefecture and the city were seized and subjected to violent treatment. Bythe very end of 1966,local leaders had lost the ability to protect themselves.While the accounts describe aggressive student groups, there is no evidenceof coordination or organizational capacity among them. There is no men-tionofanycitywide allianceofstudentorworkerrebelsthroughtheendof the year, and there is no mention of any activities by worker rebels.Beibai.This small port city on the Gulf of Tonkin is located on thesoutherncoastofGuangxiProvince.Ithad anurbanpopulationof48,400a salariedworkforce ofonly11,484,and3,187students enrolledin12middleschools,only 495 of whom were high school students.38 The local rebelmovementwasveryslowtodevelop,andtheBeihaiPartyCommitteewasfullyinchargeoflocalevents until thevery endofDecember.39Red Guardsemerged in middle schools with official encouragement and cooperated72AGENTS OF DISORDERwith work teams sent to purge the ranks of the teachers and principals inthesummer.Remarkably,these work teams were not withdrawn untilmid-October, two and a half months after they were denounced by MaoandwithdrawninBeijingandothercities.Thefirst challenge to the city's party committee was by rebel studentsfrom Beijing. On September 1, a small contingent put up a wall poster thatcalled for“bombarding”the Beihai Party Committee,which in responseimmediately put up wall posters attacking the Beijing students. ScarletGuards were quickly set up in party and government organs,factories andother workplaces.AttheendofSeptember,hundredsoflocal student ac-tivists left for Beijing, and there were no challenges to Beihai's leaders untilthe students began to return in late December. The first wall poster com-posed by local high school students calling for “bombarding” the BeihaiParty Committee did not appear until December 22. In response, city of-ficials quickly issued an apology for carrying out the “bourgeois reac-tionary line,” and later that week they went further, ordering cadres at alllevels to support rebel organizations then being formed among workers,teachers,students,and cadres.On theverylastdayof1966,an alliance of16 rebel organizations denounced the local People's Congress as unrepre-sentative, and they disrupted the session then underway. This was the firstrecorded rebel attack on a party-government organ in Beihai, where a rebelinsurgency had barely emerged by the end of 1966.UrbanizedCountiesChina's counties were primarily rural, and their urban settlements em-ployed an average of only 6,433 salaried workers.The remaining countyresidents lived in villages organized as collective farms, and their politicalactivities during this early period, if any, were focused on the villages onsmall rural towns that served as their headquarters.The counties,however,are enormouslyvaried.Some containrelatively largeurban settlements.Thetop quintile in terms of urbanization had urban populations that averaged60,312(anurbanizationrate of 15percent)and13,073salariedworkers.Weshould expect thatrebel movements developedmorerapidlyin themoreurbanized counties than in the least urbanized, and perhaps that therewouldbelittleifanyrebelactivityduringthisperiodinthemostagrariancounties.Toprovideaconcretesenseofthesedifferences,Iwilldescribe

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES73events in several counties in the most urbanized quintile and the least ur-banized two quintiles.40Ankang.TheseatofaprefecturewiththesamenameinsouthernShaanxi Province,Ankang County had a relatively large urban populationof67,140 and anindustrialworkforceof roughly4,500.Thecountyhad8middleschoolswith3,462students,butonlyoneof theschoolshadanupper division, which had 646 high school students.41 The local rebel move-ment grew during September, as student rebels from the provincial capitalof Xi'an poured into Ankang.42 The first local rebel organizations wereformed on September 15 by Red Guards who returned from Xi'an,wherethey had observed rebel attacks on the provincial party committee. Theserebels distanced themselves from the officially approved Red Guards, whichthey denounced as conservative.During this period rebel groups also beganto form within the Ankang party and government offces. After the Oc-tober Party Conference, the rebel movement grew and became more ag-gressive. The gates to the prefecture party offices were plastered with wallposters, and on October 15 the prefecture's leaders were forced to come out-sidetohear the students'denunciations.Rebelmiddle-school students in-vaded the county's party offices on November 12, and Ankang's first alli-ance of student rebels was established the next day. In late Decemberworkers finally began to form rebel groups, and on New Year's Day 1967,they established an alliance. Ankang's rebel movement had yet to seriouslychallenge the county authorities, and was just gaining momentum as theyearended.Yulin.Located in southeastern Guangxi Province, this county was alsotheseat ofYulinprefecture.Ithad58,433urbanresidents and20,100salaried workers.Its 11 middle schools had 10,134 students.43 The first studentattack on local authorities was on September 7, when a group of 500 highschoolstudentsinvadedtheprefectureheadquarters,forcingtheirwayintothe building and holding struggle sessions against a number of officeworkers.44 In response to invasions of the prefecture offices, officials inthe party and government organs formed Scarlet Guards, as did cadres inthe county government offces. The first student rebel organizations formedinlateSeptember,andtheyproliferatedinthecomingweeks74AGENTS OF DISORDERFortunately for local authorities,student rebels began hopping trains toBeijing in late September. The government encouraged this by subsidizingstudent travel expenses. This temporarily quieted the local rebellion. How-ever,whenrebel students returned,they turnedtheirfire ontotheprefec-ture authorities.They initially targeted the head of the prefecture's Cul-tural Revolution Committee, forcing his removal in mid-December, andtheysubjectedtwoprefectureofficialsonthiscommitteetoapubliccriti-cism and struggle session.On December 25 and 26 they convened massmeetings to denouncethe“bourgeoisreactionaryline”oftheprefecture’sparty committee. In attendance were more than 10,000 people: cadres fromthe offices under the prefecture and county government, workers and cadresfrom factories and mines, and Red Guards from the local schools. The pre-fecture's top official gave a self-criticism and was denounced on the stage,andseveralotherleadersweredenounced andinterrogated.Therewas,asofyet,nomentionof anyworkerrebelorganizations.Zengcheng.Located in Guangdong's heavily populated Pearl RiverDelta,Zengcheng had an urban population of 42,453 and 11,377 salariedemployees.It had 6junior middle schools with an enrollment of3,353,andtwohighschoolswithanenrollmentofonly476.45Thefirstwallposter toattack the county authorities, authored by Red Guards at the local highschool, appeared on September 7, and set off a sharp backlash.46 Cadresattending a conference in the county seat reacted strongly, charging thatopposition to the county party committee was tantamount to opposingChairman Mao. A number of them wrote wall posters denouncing the rebelstudents and demanded that they be punished. But the students refused,and instead distributed handbills charging that party committee had or-ganized attacks on the Red Guards. Alarmed by the charge, the county'sleaders convened an urgent cadre meeting and ordered a halt to counterat-tacksagainstthestudents.Despite this incident, local Red Guards gave Zengcheng's leaders littletroubleoverthenexttwomonths,largelybecausethe authoritiesorganizeddelegations of student activiststo travel toBeijing at government expensein September and October.The students returned radicalized,however, andthe rebel movement grew during December. By the end of the year morethan 100 rebel groups had formed with a total membership of more than6,00o.They formed in schools andfactories,and also in the government's

Despite the rapid formation of rebel groups, the year endedin Zengcheng without any reported attacks on the county offices, no sei-zures of offcials, and no alliances among the many small rebel groups thathadformedinthecounty.AgrarianCountiesThe counties in the least urbanized two quintiles contained an averageofonly3,693urbanresidents(anurbanizationrateof5.8percent)and2,130 salaried workers.Often relatively remote,and with tiny populationsofstudents andworkers,rebel activityin these agrarian counties was evenslower todevelop,andinmanycaseswasvirtuallynonexistent.Shanglin.Located near the geographic center of Guangxi Province,Shanglin had an urban population of 7,871 in 1966, and just over 5,000salariedworkers andstaff,manyofwhomlivedon collectivefarms.Thecounty's 7 middle schools had 2,375 students enrolled in their lower divi-sions, and only 231 in high school.47 After independent student organ-izations appeared in late September, county officials organized ScarletGuards within the county offices to defend against office invasions.48 Thisproved to be unnecessary, because student activists soon began to travelwith the assistance of local authorities. In October, the county sent threedelegations of Red Guards to Beijing to participate in the large mass ral-lies on Tiananmen Square. Perceiving new opportunities for travel, rebelgroups formed in workplaces and nearby villages and demanded that thecounty government also fund their travel. Recognizing that potential rebelswould be less troublesome if they left the county, the authorities allocatedlarge sums of money to pay for the trips.Left unmolested, the county authorities continued to issue directivesabout theconductof theCulturalRevolution,andtheyheldmajorgov-ernment meetings in the county seat well into the last half of December.Trouble did not appear until the last days of December, and not from stu-dents, but from rebel cadres.A group of rebels who worked in the countyofficesdemandedthatthecounty'sleadersmakeaself-criticismfortheinearlier loyalty investigations of teachers and students, which in their view76AGENTS OF DISORDERwas a clear case of the“bourgeois reactionaryline.”OnDecember 30,at amass meeting held in the county's one movie theater, the county magis-trate gave a speech apologizingfor errors committed earlierin the CulturalRevolution and rescinded the verdicts against those persecuted during Julyand August. Several rebel cadres stood up to make further accusations, andthemeetingfellintobedlam anddispersed.Thelast activityfor theyearwas an intriguing order issued by the county government for all firearmsin the possession of cadres and staff to be turned over to the bureau ofpublicsecurityforsafekeepingZichang.：Locatedin aremoteregioninnorthernShaanxiprovince,Zichang had an urban population of 5,970 and a salaried workforce thatnumbered only in the hundreds. The county had only two middle schools,one of which had an upper division,with a total of 935 students.9 RedGuards appeared in late August and attacked remnants of feudalism andcapitalism, including violent actions against private food stall vendors inthe county seat.50 At the end of October Red Guards began traveling toBeijingtoattendmassrallies inTiananmenSquare.Thefirstrebel organ-ization was formed after some of these students returned toZichang at theend of November. Rebels also appeared among the staff of the county'sradio station, cultural center, and government offices.At the end of De-cember there were 79 small rebel groups in the county. They had a rangeofviewpoints and constantly disagreed with one another. OnDecember 23rebel students dragged members of their high school's work team back totheir school to denounce them for carrying out the bourgeois reactionaryline—an action that was common in provincial capitals three monthsearlier. They destroyed the files compiled during the school's loyalty inves-tigations,andtheschool'sPartySecretary andthehead andmembers ofthe work team were seized and subjected to violent publicinterrogations.By the end of the year the rebels had yet to form an alliance, they had yetto invade and occupy party and government offices, and they had yet tochallengethecounty'sleaders.Zhang.Located in southern Gansu Province, Zhang County had anonagriculturalpopulationofcloseto2,oo0andalmostnosalariedemployees outside of the party and government offices.

THE PACE OF REBEL INSURGENCIES77struction.51 The county authorities organized local political activities, un-challenged, until the end of the year.52 The first Red Guard group is men-tionedonDecember8,whentheZhangCountyPartyCommitteegavethem permission to travel to Beijing. During the last week of Decembercounty officials were making travel arrangements for local students andplanning their itinerary. While on their trip to Beijing students from theZhangCountyMiddleSchoolformed a rebel organization that would even-tually target the county authorities after their return home early the nextyear. Given the tiny student numbers it is hard to imagine them as a se-rious challenge.Until the end of1966 there was nohint of a localrebelmovement.There is a vast gulf between the massive upheavals that shook Shanghaiand Nanjing to their foundations in November and December and themodest Red Guard and rebel activity in the agrarian counties.The popularinsurgencies in Shanghai and Nanjing developed early, they were large, wellorganized,and effectively reduced local political authorities to complete im-potence by the end of the year. In both cities, large popular mobilizationsof Scarlet Guards served only to further destabilize public order and un-dermine local authorities. The insurgencies in other cities that we have de-scribed had not progressed this far by the end of December, although insome cases they appeared tobe heading toward a similar outcome.Mostof the other cities had just begun to deal with rebel insurgencies in the lastweeks of the year. Qingdao and Qiqihaer faced serious disruptions early inthe autumn, but interventions by higher-level authorities to reshuffle thelocal leadershipinresponse torebeldemands stabilizedgovernment au-thority and slowed the further development of rebel insurgencies. RedGuards appeared virtually everywhere, but as we move from provincial cap-itals down through smaller cities, and from urbanized counties to agrarianones, student rebels were smaller in numbers, less well organized, less likelyto form city or county-wide coalitions, less likely to invade party and gov-ernment offices,and lesslikely toseizeleadingofficialsfor struggle sessions.If they did any of these things, it was not until the following year. Outsideof the large cities,worker rebels were less likely to appear, and where theydid, they rarely formed coalitions. Outside the large cities, we are alsoless likely to observe large and well-organized Scarlet Guard groups that78AGENTSOF DISORDERconfrontedrebelforcesandunderminedpublicorder.Andwe arelesslikely tofind that the authority of local officials was seriously undermined,even if they faced challenges from local rebels.By any comparativestandard,however,these developments stillreflecta remarkable nationwide level of popular political mobilization. This is es-pecially noteworthy given the complete lack of independent political ac-tivityinChinapriortothesummerof1966.TherewerestudentRedGuardseven in the most remote rural counties by the end of 1966,and rebel groupswere beginning to appear even there. Yet outside of the major cities, stu-dent andworkerrebels hadyet toseriously disrupt local governments orshow a capacity for coordinated political action.Despite a remarkableoverall level of popular political activity, theinsurgencies in existence bytheendof1966werefartoomodesttoaccountfortheextraordinarywaveof power seizures that toppled local governments across China during thefirst weeks of 1967. More importantly, as we shall see, the fragmented anddisorganized character of rebel insurgencies presaged the struggles thatwouldfollowfromthepowerseizuresanddrivethemuchlarger andmoreviolentconflictsthatdevelopedduring1967andpersistedwellinto1968.4THEIMPLOSIONOFTHEPARTY-STATE

THE NEXT PHASE OF CHINA's POLITICAL upheaVal Was initi-ated by spectacular developments in Shanghai during the first week of 1967.The mobilization of two massive and antagonistic alliances of workers——theWorkers'General Headquarters and the Scarlet Guards—paralyzed the cityat theendof December.TheScarletGuards,frustratedbytheirdemandsfor equal recognition with rebel workers, turned against the Shanghai au-thorities. Cadres within the city's party and government offices, includingsome ranking officials, were rapidly forming rebel groups of their own inopposition to Shanghai's Mayor and First Party Secretary. Street fightingbetween factions began during the last days of December and escalated inearly January. Masses of workers loyal to the two alliances left their jobsfor rallies and street confrontations. Railway traffic was interrupted and theport and dockyards were paralyzed.Factories were idled and parts of theelectrical grid shut down. Deliveries of coal for heating and cooking wereinterrupted and supplies of staple foods dwindled. Workers demanded andreceived cash from beleaguered offcials. As balances dwindled in the bankaccounts ofstateenterprises andoffices,residents swarmed toretailout-lets, causing runs on scarce consumer goods.Citizens rushed to withdrawtheir savings from banks, and public transportation was paralyzed.!Officials in Beijing who had earlier warned of the risks of worker rebel.lion had been proven correct, but they were not vindicated by these events.Instead,it was up to Mao and his followers to ensure that their movement

7980AGENTSOFDISORDERwould accomplishmore thansimply throwChinaintodisarray.Their so-lution was a power seizure by rebel forces on January 6, which overthrew theMayor, theFirstPartySecretary, and the vast majority of the city's rankingofficials. The power seizure was led and organized by the Maoist radicalZhangChunqiao,whoinNovemberhad signed the agreement legitimatingShanghai's new alliance of worker rebels. Zhang returned to Shanghai onJanuary 4, and working with cadre rebels inside the party apparatus andleaders of the Workers' General Headquarters, he pulled together a coali-tion to overthrow Shanghai's government, placing himself in charge.At a mass rally attended by more than 100,0o0 on the city's main publicsquare, Zhang's coalition declared victory for the rebel movement. Theyordered all workers to return to their posts, and relayed Mao's denuncia-tion of the Scarlet Guards. Relying on workers’ militias and troops in thelocal garrison, they acted quickly to restore factory production, transpor-tation links, and public order. They denounced the disruption of the city'spublic order as a plot devised by underhanded party officials to save them-selvesbyluringworkers tomake demandsforworkplacebenefits and cash.Somedayslatertheywouldmarktheirrevolutionbyrenamingthecity'sgovernmentthe“ShanghaiCommune,”alabel thatwaseventually aban-doned in favor of“Revolutionary Committee."2 This signaled a new formof governanceby cadrerebels and theleaders ofpopularinsurgencies.Mao viewed the Shanghai events as a victorious conclusion to the rebelcampaign.He issued a congratulatory telegram showering theShanghairebels with praise; it was published nationwide and read out on radio broad-casts on January 12.3 This made clear to rebel groups throughout thecountry that the overthrow of local governments was not only acceptable,but encouraged. The response elsewhere in China was initially slow, as theimplications of Shanghai's example sunk in.Prior toMao's declaration ofsupport on January 12, only 8 other localities reported power seizures. Thepace sped up on January 12, and over the next 10 days, no fewer than 75cities and countiesreported one.The power seizures turned into a tidal wave after January 22, 1967. Onthat day the national media, going beyond praise for Shanghai, urged rebelsnationwide to seize government power. Several articles on the first page ofthat day's People'sDaily called onrebels to overthrowlocal leaders and seizepower. The title of the authoritative front-page editorial captures the tone:

By the end of January, only 9 daysafter January 22, a total of 1,090 local governments were overthrown—just under half of all cities and counties in the entire country. By the endofFebruary,the number reached 1,563,and by the end of March,1,736.A few months later there were confirmed power seizures in 80 percent ofall cities and counties. Table 4.1 charts the remarkably rapid spread ofpower seizures, and it reveals a top-down pattern, with provincial capitalsfallingfirst,followedby other cities and after some delay,rural counties.Despite the small size oftheurban populations ofruralcounties,theirfrequentlyremotelocations,and theirmuch smaller numbers of studentsand workers, almost half of all county governments were already over-thrown in January, and more than 75 percent had been overthrown by theendofMarch.Figure 4.1shows inmoredetail the explosiveimpact of theJanuary 22call for power seizures, drawing on the subgroup of localities that reportedthe exact date.

Recall the trends noted earlier: the first reportedseizures of at least one party-state offcial occurred in fewer than half of

THEIMPLOSIONOFTHEPARTY-STATE83county-level cities and fewer than 40 percent of counties by the end of De-cember. The first reported rebel invasion of party and government officesoccurred in only 26 percent of county-level cities and only 11 percent incounties by the end of December. Virtually the same percentages were re-cordedforthefirstreportedrebelcoalition.How seriously were local authorities undermined by rebel insurgenciespriortopowerseizures?Local annalsfrequentlyreferto a situation wherelocal governments were so disrupted that they were no longer able to func-tion.The common term for this is that governments were“paralyzed”(tan-huan). This term was used to describe the condition of local governmentsat some point in time in 1,415 out of 2,246 local annals—63 percent ofthe total (see Table 4.2). It is possible that some annals did not use thisterm where it was warranted. It is also possible that the term was not usedbecause local authorities were never seriously undermined. The percentagesreported in Table 4.2 refer only to those localities where “paralysis" wasreported, and to the timing of the paralysis of local governments.Only 30 percent of provincial capitals that reported an inability to governhad reached this point by the end of December. As previously describedShanghai and Nanjing were among them, but Guangzhou and Nanningwere not. Less than one quarter of other cities, and 19 percent of counties,reported a state of paralysis by the end of December.Yet government pa-ralysis spread very rapidly during January 1967. By the end of that monththe governments of almost all provincial capitals were reportedly paralyzed,Table 4.2.

THEIMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE85monly reported event was the seizure of a local leader—still well below30percent of local governments.Rebel coalitions and government paral-ysis both remained around 10 percent. In January 1967, the trend lines foreach move upward more rapidly, but the line for power seizures shoots pastall of them during January and February and stays well above all three otherindicatorsofrebelinsurgenciesthereafterHints abouttherelationshipofpriorrebelactivity topowerseizures areevident in the subset of the most detailedoflocalnarratives.When wasthe first seizure of a local leader by rebels relative to the date of a powerseizure?There were 420 annals that reported the exact date of both events.Slightlymorethanhalfofallseizuresofgovernmentleadersoccurbeforethe day of a power seizure, but in the remaining localities the first seizureof a local leader occurred only on the day of a power seizure or afterwards.In this subgroup of localities, the median date for the seizure of an officialwas only10daysbeforethepowerseizure.When was the first report of the formation of a rebel coalition relativeto a power seizure?There were 415 annals that reported theexact date ofboth events. In only 42 percent of these localities were rebel coalitions re-ported before the day of the power seizure, and in close to 30 percent ofthe others the first rebel coalition was reported on the day of the powerseizure itselfwhich suggests that rebel coalitions were often formed onlyfor the purposes of seizing power. This conclusion is reinforced by the factthat the median date of the first report of a rebel coalition in this subgroupofcasesis thesameday as thepower seizure.A final hint can be found in reports of local government paralysis. Ofthe 368 cases where the date of both government paralysis and the powerseizure is known, only 13 percent report paralysis before the day of the powerseizure.This suggests that the paralysis of most local governments——unlikeShanghai and Nanjing—was in fact a consequence of power seizures ratherthan aprecursor.Power seizures,in other words,occurred far more widely, and far morerapidly, than indicators of the strength and impact of rebel insurgencieswould have predicted. This is true even if we assume that seizures of offi-cials,rebel alliances, and government paralysis were reported less fully thanlocal power seizures.Essentially, there were far more power seizures, oc-curring far earlier, than what we would expect if they were the product ofrebel insurgencies based on popular rebellions.86AGENTS OFDISORDERTheSpreadofPowerSeizuresAlthough there is a puzzling lack of connection between popular rebel-lion and power seizures, there is a clear relationship between the timing ofpower seizures at different levels of the national government hierarchy.Power seizures spread in a top-down pattern. This was already indicatedby Table 4.1,which showed that power seizures spreadfirstin theprovin-cial capitals, later in other cities, and later still in the counties. The top-down pattern was in fact tighter and more systematic than these aggregatefigures suggest. Within each province, prefecture-level cities and prefecturesoverwhelmingly experienced power seizures only after their provincial cap-ital.Within prefectures, county-level cities and counties overwhelminglyexperiencedpower seizures only after theirprefecture.Power seizures oc-curred in a top-down cascade that radiated downward through the linesofthenationalbureaucratichierarchyWe have seen that January 22 was the starting point for the rapidlyspreading wave of power seizures.It was also the starting point for a down-wardcascadeofpowerseizureswithinthestate'sbureaucratichierarchyBeforeJanuary 22,power seizures occurred more or less randomly acrossregions and levels of the bureaucratic hierarchy. Afterwards, a clear top-down pattern takes hold. Before January 22 the majority of power seizuresoccurbefore apowerseizure attheimmediatelyhigherjurisdiction.Inthesubset of 1,110cases where the exact dates areknown,63percent of cityand county power seizuresbeforeJanuary 22 occurred before a power sei-zure over the province; 67 percent of prefecture power seizures occurredbefore their province; and 47 percent of county power seizures occurredbefore their prefecture. After January 22, the pattern is reversed: only15 percent of counties and 17 percent of prefectures seized power beforetheir province, and only 18 percent of counties before their prefecture.In this top-down pattern, distance did not matter. The distance ofprefecture-level cities from provincial capitals, and the distance of coun-ties from their prefecture capitals, did not have an impact on the likelihoodor timing of a power seizure. Table 4.3 divides jurisdictions into five quin-tiles by distance from the next higher level in the bureaucratic hierarchy,among the subset of cases where the date of the power seizure is known.The second column shows the average distance from the immediately higherjurisdiction in thegovernmenthierarchy,andrangesfromlocalities that

There is no relationship between distance and eitherthe percentage of jurisdictions that experienced a power seizure or the me-dian date at which a power seizure took place. Whatever the pressures gen-erated by a power seizure at the immediately higher level of government,and whomever these pressures acted upon, it was just as strong where thehigher-level jurisdictionwas distant aswhenitwasnearbyThe apparent lack of connection between the strength of popular insur-gencies and power seizures is accompanied by clear signs that power seizuresdiffused in a top-down fashion within the bureaucratic structures of thiscentralized dictatorship. What political process generated this pattern?These patterns raise a fundamental question: what, exactly, was a“powerseizure"?Who seizedpower,and what was it that spurred them todo sowhen they did, creating such a clear top-down pattern? These questions areespecially puzzling because of the extraordinarily rapid spread of power sei-zures, representing the virtual collapse of what had been a disciplined andhighly centralized state structure.WhoSeizedPower?Who, if not rebel students and workers,generated the rapid wave ofpower seizures across China? I have already described rebellions by partyand government cadres against their own superiors. These rebellions got88AGENTS OF DISORDERinderwaymuchlater thanthestudentandworkerrebellions,andtheyonlybecame amajorforce near the end of1966.In citieslikeShanghai andNan-jing, which had very large and highly disruptive popular insurgencies wellbefore the end of 1966, rebellions by party-state cadres appeared duringDecember and criticallyunderminedlocal governments from within.Inlarge cities with sizable popular insurgencies, cadre rebels cooperated withworker and studentrebelsin overthrowing their superiors and declaringnew organs of power. In one typical example, the January power seizurefrom the Zhejiang provincial authorities was carried out jointly by an alli-ance of 30 mass organizations together with an alliance of cadre rebelsknown as the“Allied Command of Revolutionary Rebels in the ProvincialOrgans."/But theinfluenceof cadrerebelswasmuchgreater outsidethelarge cities. In smaller cities and counties, as we shall see, these rebel bu-reaucrats actually organized and led power seizures. They sometimes co-operated with relatively small groups of students or workers,if there wereany in existence, but they frequently seized power unilaterally. Only throughreference to the political action of rebel bureaucrats can we account for theremarkablyrapidspreadofpowerseizures across China,andinparticulartheir top-down spread within the national bureaucratic hierarchyIt seems counterintuitive that cadres would act to undermine the verystructures towhichtheirvested interestswereintimatelytied.Thisran en-tirely counter to their presumed group interests. Yet the motives for rebelbureaucrats,on closer examination,are nothard to understand.In thesummer of 1966 they were already mobilized into loyalty campaigns inwhich selected individuals at all ranks were stripped of their posts and de-nounced. During these initial months, the vast majority of party and gov-ernment functionaries sought to demonstrate unquestionable loyalty totheir superiors, who coordinated these loyalty campaigns. As rebel move-ments among students gathered momentum in September and October,some of them actively participated in Scarlet Guard groups that werefounded explicitly to protect their offices and especially their superiors fromrebel attacks. After the end of the October Party Conference, however, theloyalty investigations conducted by local governments were denounced,andofficial efforts to restrict the student movement and coordinate counter-mobilization——-in particular theScarlet Guards——were declared tobe severepoliticalerrors.In this altered context, it appeared increasingly likely that leading offcialsat all levels would lose their posts. Subordinates in party and government

THE IMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE89offices who had previously supported their superiors actively, especiallythose who had been active in Scarlet Guard organizations, found it neces-sary to distance themselves from their superiors and show sympathyforthe rebel movement. In provincial capitals and other large cities, cadresbegan to form rebel groups of their own, and they found it in their interestto cooperate actively with student and worker rebels who were preparingtoseizepower.Onlyinthiswaycouldpartyandgovernmentofficialshopeto avoid becoming victims of the escalating campaign.In the small cities and counties,there was little threat from popular insurgencies, which were small and weak, and in many remote localitiespractically nonexistent. Cadre rebels in these localities were spurred to seizepowerby news of a power seizure at theimmediately higher level in thebureaucratichierarchy.If theyfailedtofollowsuit,theyriskedbeingde-posed by rebels at higher levels who had seized power before them. Andthey risked being preempted by other local cadres contemplating their ownpower seizure, or by a sudden offce invasion by a small group of studentor worker rebels who might declare themselves in charge. Under such rap-idlyshiftingcircumstances,theonlywaytocontrolyour ownfatewastoactquicklybeforeothersdidso.Beforesubstantiatingthisanalysiswithexamplesdrawnfromthemostdetailed local accounts, we should take note of the size, distribution, andcharacteristics of this crucial group. China in the mid-1960s was a highlyorganized and centralized dictatorship.Twointertwined hierarchies reachedfrom the capital to the grass roots. The central government presided directlyover 29 province-level jurisdictions, which in turn presided over a hierarchyof more than 200 prefectures, close to 170 cities, and more than 2,100 ruralcounties,each ofwhichwas directly subordinate to a unit at theimmedi-ately higher level.8Paralleling the government hierarchy was a network ofparty committees whose personnel overlapped with and controlled govern-ment agencies at each level. On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, therewere 2.4 million full-time party and government functionaries in these twohierarchies. Close to 300,000 were full-time party functionaries in 4,400party committees and related offces. The remaining 2.1 million staffed gov-ernmentoffices,andmorethan80percentofthemwerepartymembersorganizedinto117,0o0partybranches.Communicationwithinthishierarchy was highly effective. Offcials were woven into a national networkthat spanned levels in the hierarchy, and that promoted discipline withinlocal agencies.90AGENTS OFDISORDERNo occupational group in China had a more direct interest in the courseand outcomes of political campaigns,especially if they took the form of aloyalty investigation. No group enjoyed more privileges in this centrallyplanned economy. As an interest group, party-state cadres had enormousvested interests in the preservation of a system in which they held a highlyfavorable position.But their positions as individuals were not secure.Morethan any other group, the loyalty of party-state officials was monitored, andsignificant numbers were periodically found wanting and were sanctioned.Throughout the1950s and asrecently as1965therehadbeenperiodicloyalty campaigns, during each of which significant numbers of cadres losttheir positions in disgrace, and in some cases were expelled from the citiesor sent to labor camps. Survival in such a hierarchy required vigilance toensurethat one'sloyaltydidnotcomeundersuspicion.Therewasnoalter-native form of employment, and no palatable exit option. Cadres lackedpersonal assets or business interests that could support a post-bureaucraticcareer.Theycouldnotresigntotakeupemploymentin aprivatesector orindependentpublicinstitutions.Theycouldnotinitiate atransfertoan-otherlocationorworkplace.Finally, the distribution of cadres across government jurisdictions en-sured that theywere animportant political force invirtually every localityin the country. While this may seem obvious, it is less obvious that theycomprised afarhigherpercentage of thenonagricultural laborforcein Chi-na's vast rural hinterland, where their political influence was thereby mag-nified.InTable4.4we cansee the enormous differencesbetweencities andcounties in both thenumbers of cadres and their relativeweight in the non-agricultural workforce. Cadre numbers were largest in the provincial capi-tals, where they averaged more than 50,0oo. But the provincial capitals hadmassive nonagricultural workforces, so at the median, cadres as a groupwere only 9percent of the total.The ratios were similarin cities ofall sizes.Butin the counties,themedian number of cadres relativetoworkers andstaffwas34percent,one third thesizeofthetotalsalariedworkforce.10Thismeansthatinhalfofallcounties,thenumberofcadreswasmorethan34 percent of the salaried workforce.

cates that it is precisely where the populations of workers and students weresmall that the relative numbers of party and government functionaries werehigh—and by extension, that they would be the main force behind powerseizures.TheRebellionoftheCadresThis reasoning is borne out by the most detailed available accounts ofpower seizures. Published local annals for the cities routinely mention cadrerebels and describe their participation in power seizures alongside workerand student groups. Published annals for the counties and small cities some-times mention their existence,but providelittle detail about their activi-ties or motives. Fortunately, we have access to highly detailed internal in-vestigationreportsforGuangxiProvince,and theyshedconsiderablelighton the cadre rebellions. These materials describe a late but very rapid spreadof cadre rebellions. Only 33 percent of all cities and counties in the prov.ince reported active cadre rebels by the end ofNovember,but the numberreached60percentby theendof December 1966,and98percentby theendofJanuary1967.llThe intrabureaucratic rebellion emerged slowly, after some delay. TheOctober Party Conference was a crucial turning point and signaled the im-minent end of local leaders’ strategies to contain rebel insurgencies. Heldin Beijing in mid-October and attended by thousands of offcials from92AGENTS OF DISORDERacross the country, the meeting's purpose was to“clarify thinking" aboutthe Cultural Revolution. The key event was Chen Boda's speech of Oc-tober 16, in which he denounced local leaders’efforts to restrict the scopeof the rebellion and specifically repudiated mass organizations whose pur-pose was to protect power holders. Chen declared that these and other ef-forts represented a“bourgeois reactionary line”(zichan jieji fandong luxian)that was anti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao. He called for all such ac-tionstocease,andforstudentrebelstotargetleaderswhocarriedoutthisreactionary line. Chen's speech was issued nationwide as the key documentto come out of the October meetings.12Local accounts in Guangxi mention the October Conference as causinga major shift in local politics, and some specifically mention Chen's speech.13When the meeting's decisions were relayed to lower levels, they signaled toall who had been targeted in loyalty campaigns directed by party officialsthat their punishments might be overturned. More importantly, however,they signaled to all who had cooperated loyally with theirleaders that theyhad to reconsider their position, because they were now exposed as collab-orators in an erroneous political line. Should their leaders fall from power,loyal subordinateswould fall along with them.As the implications of theOctoberPartyConferencesankin,cadres throughout Chinarapidlyreevaluatedtheirstances.The rebellion began in the Guangxi provincial party and governmentofficesshortlyaftertheOctobermeetings.Accountsfromvariousprovin-cial departments mention independent rebel groups later that month, andthey are mentioned with increasing frequency in November and December.By the end of 1966,virtually all of the departments in the provincial partyandgovernmentheadquartersharboredrebelorganizationswithnamessimilar to those adopted by student and worker groups. By January 1967,these internal rebellions appear to have become nearly universal in provin-cialagencies.14After Beijing's early December directive authorizing the formation ofrebelgroups among workers,Nanning'sMunicipal Party Secretary in-formed local office personnel that this authorization applied to them aswell. Rebel organizations and small fighting groups soon mobilized withinthe city's bureaucracy.

The following week they joined with student and workerrebels in staging a mass struggle session against the city's top officials.15Scarlet Guards in the party and government organs fell apart rapidlyafterOctober.InQinzhouPrefecture,theyweredisbandedshortlyafterOctober and cadres and staff began to form their own independent rebelorganizations.1° In Lingui County the Scarlet Guards rapidly disappearedas cadres and staf reportedly“rushed”to establish autonomous rebelgroups. By the end of November, in the 29 offces and departments in thecounty administration there were more than 50 small fighting groups, withamembershipof520outofthecounty's883cadresandstaff.1/FusuiCounty had more than 80 rebel organizations at this point in time, with22 of them in various party and government offices, including the organ-ization department, the party committee's staff office, and propaganda department. The rebel leaders were ordinary cadres, political instructors,and press correspondents.18 In Tiandong County, cadres and staff in theparty and government offices organized a range of small fighting groupsandone cross-department alliance,the“Rebel Headquarters”(zaofansilingbu),whichhadmorethan100members.LedbycadresfromthePublicSecurity Bureau, the Discipline Inspection Commission, and the courts, ittook the lead in a rebellion against their own superiors. In Pubei County,the Scarlet Guards, instead of disbanding, turned on their masters, simplychangingtheirname andrebrandingthemselvesasrebelorganizations de-voted to repudiating the bourgeois reactionary line.20In Qinzhou County, ordinary cadres in the county office and tradeunion formed a rebel brigade of more than 400 individuals who had fallenunder suspicion in recent loyalty investigations. They agitated to overturntheir cases and held struggle sessions against the county officials who hadorganized the campaign that victimized them.2l Cadre “fighting groups"became common in Lingchuan County in November 1966. In December,they formed an alliance across the departments under the county's partycommittee. Cadres formed a separate rebel alliance in the offices under thecounty government. They held struggle sessions against the county's PartySecretary,Vice-Secretaries,CountyMagistrate,andViceMagistrate.Notsatisfiedwithrepudiatingthecurrentleaders,theytraveledtotheheadquarters of Hechi Prefecture to seize the county's previous Party Secretary,who recently had been promoted to a higher post there, and subjected him94AGENTS OFDISORDERto struggle sessions. The cadre rebels charged that the county's Party Sec-retary and the Chief Judgewere“historical counterrevolutionaries,”leadingeventually to the Judge's suicide in January 1967.22BylateDecember,cadrerebelsbegantoclaim authority over the con-ductofthelocal CulturalRevolution.RebelsintheofficesofYulinPrefec-turepushed theofficial CulturalRevolutionCommitteesaside andelectednew ones.23 In Lingshan County, cadres in the county offices formed newcommittees to“bombard"the county's Party Secretary and other leaders.They put up wall posters, held struggle sessions, and formed an alliance ofthe many small fighting groups in the county offices.24Party leaders found it increasingly diffcult to control regularly sched-uled meetings. Near the end of December, the Guangxi provincial authori-ties,hoping to stem the spiraling loss of their authority, ordered partysecretaries to apologize to rebels for conducting a bourgeois reactionary line.In Mengshan County, party leaders convened such a meeting, speaking toanassemblyof some2,ooo.On the secondday,theheadof thecounty'srural department stood up to denounce them. He revealed incriminatinginformation about wrongdoing that the county's Party Secretary had failedtomention,and he called forhis removal.The meetingbroke up in dis-array. On January 6, this beleaguered Party Secretary convened anothermeeting to repeat his self-criticism to an even larger audience. Shortly afterthe meeting began he and other officials were kicked off the stage, and theylost control of the proceedings. Cadre rebels in the county offices heldstruggle sessions against members of the county party committee and theheads of all 27 county departments. They were paraded through the streetsand their homes were searched.25 During December the leaders of Ling-shan, Hepu, Wuming, Qinzhou, and Pubei Counties all lost control ofregularly scheduled party congresses, which were taken over by cadre rebelswho subjected them to struggle sessions and called for their removal.26A series of interviews withfivelong-retired officials in Zouping County,Shandong, shed further light on the type of cadre rebellions described inthe Guangxi Province materials.27 Fifty miles from the provincial capitalof Ji'nan, Zouping had 9,461 urban residents, 1,262 cadres, and only 1 highschool in 1966.28 All of the interviewees were junior staff members in thecounty headquarters at the time, and all were active in rebel groups. It wasclear during thecourse of theinterviews that thevastmajority of cadres in

THE IMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE95the county seat were active in rebel groups, and that they played pivotalrole in the conflicts of the period.One cadre worked in the planning office of the county government andled a rebel group of office staff. According to him, rebel groups formedbased on the structure of the party branches in party and government de-partments. Each party branch formed its own fighting group, and fre-quently the party branch secretaries ended up as rebel leaders.In this sense,the party organization turned back upon its own leaders, and the party'sown organizational structure facilitated an internal rebellion. His groupwas formed in December 1966, after they sent delegates to Beijing andfound that there was already widespread rebellion within party and gov-ernment offices in the nation's capital.29 When the delegates returned fromBeijing and reported what they had learned, they immediately organizedtheirrebelgroup.A second cadre worked in the county industrial bureau, where he wasthe leader of a rebel group that included some 30 of the 40 cadres. The onlycadreswhowere excludedwere thosewhowere department or sectionheads.According to his recollection, those who were most active in the re-bellion against the county's leaders were political activists who were al-ready infuential and trusted by leaders prior to the Cultural Revolution.In this sense, the leaders’favored subordinates were among the key orga-nizersoftherebellion.TheRoleofCadresinPowerSeizuresWhat role did cadre rebels play in power seizures? In Guangxi, therewere growing rebellions within party and government organs at each levelof government by December 1966. These rebellions became larger and moremilitant in response to the publicity about Shanghai. After a coalition ofrebels seizedpower over Guangxi Province onJanuary 23,power seizuresspread rapidly to cities,prefectures, and counties in the province.The nar-rative accounts make clear that cadre rebels were active at all levels of gov-ernment,but theyplayeda muchmore centralroleinruralprefecturesand counties. In the provincial capital of Nanning and the prefecture-levelcities of Guilin,Liuzhou,andWuzhou,cadrerebelsformed allianceswithstudent and worker groups that had been active in late 1966. In the rural96AGENTSOF DISORDERprefectures with headquarters in small towns, and especially in counties,cadrerebelsplayed adominantrole,andinmostcounties,theyseizedpowerunilaterallywithlittle attentiontostudent andworkerrebels,whoweremuch less formidable than in the large cities.In Nanning, there were separate power seizures in each of the govern-mentheadquarterslocatedin the city:GuangxiProvince,NanningMunicipality, and Nanning Prefecture. Within the Guangxi provincial officesthere were a series of separate power seizures during the third week of Jan-uary. The cadres that seized power were not department or bureau heads.Thehighestrankingof therebelleaders——inroughlyhalf oftheoffices—were section chiefs orbureau vice heads.The remaining rebel leaders wereprimarily ordinary cadres,personal aides,or officestaff.Theydisplaced thetop officials in their units—bureau and department heads—who wereforcedtoyield control totheirsubordinates.Thecadrerebels alignedthem-selves with coalitions of workers and students and participated in thepower seizure over GuangxiProvince on January 23.3° In theNanningMu-nicipal offices, a large cadre rebel alliance joined a simultaneous powerseizureovertheprovincialandmunicipalauthoritiesaspartofalargeralliance known as the“Grand Rebel Army”(zaofan dajun),whose mainforce was a group of rebel workers. On the day of the power seizure thecadre rebels elected new leadersfor their departments.31In the Nanning Prefecture offices, a rebel group within the party com-mittee office issued an urgent communique on January 23 and called to-gether rebels from various administrative departments for discussions.Along with rebels from five other departments, they issued a call for animmediate power seizure. On January 24, delegates from the prefecture of-fices met to plan a power seizure. Some argued for immediate action: iftheydidnotmoveimmediately,worker andstudentrebelsmightseizepower first, making things“difficult to manage."On January 25, they helda mass meeting of more than one thousand prefectural cadres to denounceall of the party Secretaries and Vice-Secretaries, who were all expelled fromtheir posts.32 Unlike their colleagues in Guangxi Province and NanningMunicipality,cadrerebelsinNanningPrefectureseizedpowerunilaterallywithout any participation by students or workers.33Guilin was another large city with militant student and worker alliancesin thefall of1966.Guilin was the seatof GuilinPrefecture,but it alsohadaseparate city administration.Thecadrerebelsin thecity administration

THE IMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE97acted as partners in power seizures carried out with large student and workeralliances. Their “Revolutionary Rebel Regiment of Staff and Cadres in theCity Administration”established on December 10,eventually joined stu-dents andworkersinseizingcontrol of Guilin'scity administration onJanuary 24.34 As in Nanning, the cadre rebels in Guilin were simply part ofan alliance in which they were outnumbered by much larger groups of rebelstudents and workers, and with whom they cooperated in seizing power.In the offices of Guilin Prefecture, however, cadre rebels played a muchmore centralrole.OnJanuary24,theyformedan alliance across departments andalignedthemselveswithotherrebels.Latethateveningtheycalledtogethertheleadersof their alliance anddecidedtomoveforwardimmediately with a power seizure before other rebels could do so.Shortlyafter midnight they placed the entire leadership of the prefecture underhouse arrest and issued a proclamation that they were now in charge.35Narratives for the city of Liuzhou describe a central role for cadre rebelsLike Guilin, Liuzhou was the administrative seat for a large prefecture. Theprefecture administered 11 counties, and Liuzhou City had separate partyandgovernmentoffices.Rebelsinseveralcity andprefecturedepartmentsdeclaredpowerseizureswithintheirownoffices aftertheJanuary12PeopleDailyeditorialpraisingShanghai,and thedepartmentalpowerseizures ac-celerated in response to the January 22 articles in the same newspaper.The leader of one of the main rebel groups, an aide in the party committeeoffice,calledtogetherrebelleadersfrom other citydepartmentstodiscussan alliance, and they planned for a power seizure on January 25. They be.latedly realized,however, that theyhad forgotten toinclude representa-tives from rebels in the prefecture government. They were unaware of thefact that delegates from 29 rebel groups in the prefecture's party and government organs were simultaneously meeting to prepare a power seizure.The prefecture cadres learned that cadres in other offices were discussingtheir own power seizures,sothe group decidedimmediately toproclaim apower seizure and forced the prefecture's leading cadres to sign an agree-ment to hand over power.The power seizures in city and prefecture there-foreproceededsimultaneouslywithoutcoordination,andwithnoinvolvementbyworker and studentrebels.36In Yulin Prefecture, a rural jurisdiction of 8 counties, cadre rebels de-clared a unilateral power seizure explicitly in order to preempt a power sei-zure by an alliance of rebel workers. On January 18,a group of worker98AGENTSOF DISORDERrebels based in the prefecture’s offcial trade union formed a“power sei-zure committee.”Rebels in the prefecture headquarters hurriedly pushedthrough their own power seizure to prevent this“outside group”from doingso.On January 24,theyissued a proclamation and summoned the PartySecretary andPrefectureHead to amassmeetingofallcadres,and removedthem from office.37 Cadres in Bose Prefecture, by contrast, included stu-dents and workers intheir alliance.There were two rebel alliances in theprefecture offices,and theyformedapowerseizure committeecomposedof leaders from 16 rebel groups. On January 25, they called together 69rebel groups for a power seizure rally on the premises of the prefecture,takingcontrolofthebuilding.38The accounts of province, city, and prefecture power seizures indicatethat it was primarily in the large cities that alliances of student and workerrebels played an important role,but in each case,they were joined by alli-ances of cadre rebels,who frequently acted as coordinators. In some of thecities and in themore rural prefectures,however,the narrativesmake clearthat cadre rebels were instrumentalin organizing local power seizures,sometimes choosing to include workers and student groups, sometimes not.Below the prefectures and prefecture-level cities in Guangxi were 82counties and county-level cities, almost all of which experienced power sei-zures. There were three basic patterns in accounts of these power seizures.In the first, cadre rebels are described as seizing power unilaterally, withoutany mention of student or workers.In the second, cadre rebels voluntarilyincluded students and workers in alliances that they organized. In the third,cadre rebels unilaterally seized power precisely in order to avert the possi-bility that outside groups might do so, or in order to preempt rival cadrerebels.Examples of first pattern, in which cadre rebels seized power withoutany mention of mass organizations,are Bose,Beiliu,Wuming,Dongxingand Lingshan Counties. In Bose, two large alliances of cadre rebels tookthe lead: one was headed by a cadre in the party committee staff office, theother by a cadre in the planning committee. The members of their powerseizure committee, which moved on January 27, were all ordinary cadres.39InBeiliu,cadres formed a power seizure committee on January 26,the dayafter theywereinformedthatthecadresintheYulinPrefectureofficeshaddone so. The rebel leaders all held lower-level staff positions.4o Cadres inthe Wuming county headquarters seized power on January 26,under the

THEIMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE99leadership of a clerk in the county court. In Dongxing, the power seizurewas carried out entirelyby rebels in the county offices,after hearing newsof the provincial power seizure.42 Although Lingshan had a large and ac-tivestudentRedGuardmovement,thepowerseizuretherewascoordinatedby cadre rebels in the county offices. In mid-January, they selected a cadrefrom the bureau of public security as their leader, and seized power fromtheirsuperiors.43Examples of the second pattern, in which cadres cooperated with out-side rebels, are Fusui and Pubei Counties. In Fusui, a cadre in the organ-ization department and an investigator from the discipline inspection officeled the effort. Formally declaring their power seizure on February 1, the30-personpowerseizure committeeincludedordinary cadres,staff,tech-nicians, workers, teachers, and students.44 In Pubei County, the leader of arebel alliance in the county administration, a staff member in the countyparty office, convened meetings of more than 90 rebel leaders from acrossthe county to discuss a power seizure, and a separate meeting for rebelswithin the county administration, culminating in a power seizure.45The third pattern was more common: cadre rebels seized power due tothe imminent threat of an attempted power seizure by an outside group,or by rival cadre rebels. Imminent threats by outside groups or rival rebelsare mentioned in the accounts from Guiping, Chongzuo, Qinzhou,Gongcheng,Laibin, and Lingui Counties. In Guiping, cadre rebels, wor-ried that studentRed Guards would soon act,seized power over the countyin anticipation.46 In Chongzuo, Red Guards led by a high school studentjoined together with a group of worker rebels to seize power in severalcounty offices. This spurred cadre rebels to seize power the same day overtheir own offices, and they quickly formed a committee to seize overallpowerin thecounty twodayslater.f/InQinzhou,cadrerebelsrushed toseizepower aheadofarebel allianceledbyahighschoolRedGuard,buttheyfailed todosobeforethe students acted.Thecadresnonetheless de-clared their own power seizure, setting off controversy between the twosides.48 In Gongcheng, two rival groups in the county administrationplanned separately to seize power, prompting one of them to act preemp-tively, sparking strong protests by the excluded cadre rebels.4 In Laibin,cadre rebels were spurred to action by a proclamation by student RedGuards that they intended to seize power. They held an urgent a late-nightmeeting and seized power the next morning.50100AGENTS OF DISORDERThemere possibility that outside groups might eventually attempt toseize power appears to have been enough to spur cadre rebels to seize powerin Tiandong, Luzhai, and Lingyun Counties. In Tiandong, cadre rebelsnotedthattheinclusionofstudentandworkerrebelsintheprovincialpowerseizure had created confused lines of authority, making it very difficult forthem to conduct business. This argument was enough to spur them to seizepower in the absence of any imminent moves by student or worker groups.51In Luzhai, cadres were spurred into action by news of the power seizure inLiuzhouPrefecture.Cadres whohad observed the power seizure inLiu-zhou rushed back and argued that failing to act quickly would risk powerseizures by others——they seized power two days later.52 In Lingyun, cadrerebels planning their power seizure disagreed about the severity of thecountyParty Secretary's errors,delaying their planned action.After a delayof several days, the head of the county People's Armed Department per-sonally convened a separate power seizure committee, arguing that if thecadres did not act immediately outside groups might invade the county of-fices and take over. They proceeded to seize power a few days later.53In Guangxi Province, the top-down pattern of power seizures was verypronounced. On January 23, one day after Beijing's urgent call for powerseizures, there were simultaneous power seizures over the province and itscapital city (Nanning). One prefecture experienced a power seizure on thesame day.ByJanuary26,three dayslater,all12prefectures andprefecture-level cities had experienced a power seizure, along with 19 counties. ByJanuary 31,power seizures had spread to all but 17 of the 82 counties andcounty-level cities. Only 7 county-level jurisdictions had yet to experiencea power seizure by the end of February; two of these would have powerseizuresinearlyMarch,andfivewouldneverhave one.Guangxidisplayeda top-down pattern almost perfectly, as power seizures spread rapidly fromhigher- to lower-level jurisdictions. There were simultaneous power seizuresin different levels of the hierarchy on 8 occasions, but none occurred priortoone attheimmediatelyhigherlevel.StateCollapseasaCascadingProcessThe cascade of power seizures was not the product of popular rebellion.In fact, most power seizures were either organized by or unilaterally car-ried out by government functionaries who worked in party and governmentTHEIMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE

101agencies. The speed with which they spread, and the clear top-down pat-tern,are indicators of internal political processes within the structures ofthe party-state. In this sense, the collapse of civilian political authority inthis vast political hierarchy was more an “inside-out" than a “bottom-upprocess.Astheyspreaddownwardinthehierarchy,powerseizuresaremore ac-curately described as a series of internal political coups—with varying de-grees of popular participation—where government functionaries turnedagainst their own superiors. Given the central political role of cadres,whoenjoyed high status and privilege in this political system, one might legiti-mately question whether this was a“real” rebellion. As we shall see, powerseizurescarriedoutunilaterallybycadreswerelatervulnerabletoaccusa-tions that they were “fake”nothing more than palace coups. Whateverone'sviewonthisissueofinterpretation,theserebellionswereundeniablyvery real in their consequences. They marked the collapse of civilian po-litical authority across much of the country, and in most regions paved thewayfor another18monthsoffactionalconflictandpoliticalviolence.Two decades later, similarly organized communist regimes collapsed rap-idly and unexpectedly across Eastern Europe. In response, social scientistsbegantoquestionprevailing theories ofrevolution,whichseemedunableto predict such events or adequately explain them in retrospect.54 Oneresponsewasrenewed attentiontothreshold andcriticalmassmodels ofcollective behavior, which emphasize the interdependencies of individualdecisions that shift propensities of individuals to participate in collec-tive action.55 Applied to protests in these settings, these models explainedsudden escalations in protest as a function of information fows or socialnetworks.56These analyses appeared, at least implicitly, to treat the collapse of a re-gime as a function of the scale of popular protest. State-centered theoriesof revolution, by contrast, insist that the impact of mass mobilization ishighly contingent on the prior existence of structural weaknesses that makeregimes vulnerable to mass mobilization from below. Especially importantareprior cleavages amongrulingelites or organizationalweaknesses of thestate apparatus.′7 These theories emphasize preexisting conditions——theorganization of state authority, fiscal strains, or pressures emanating fromthe international system.They leave unexamined the internal politics ofstatestructures duringthecourseoftheeventswhoseoutcomestheyseek102AGENTS OF DISORDERto explain. Popular challenges are assumed to place pressures on states:strongstates aremorelikely towithstandthem,whilestructurallyfawedstates aremorevulnerable.How andwhy states unravel remains unexam-ined,and is assumed tofollowfrominitialstructural circumstances.What emerges from our examination of China in early 1967 is a state-centeredanalysisthat appliesdynamicmodelsofcollectivebehaviortotheindividuals who are agents of the party-state. These state-centered processes,however, do not depend on structural faws or preexisting cleavages in statestructures.Infact,thesamefeaturesthatlent thesepoliticalstructures theirextraordinary discipline and mobilizational capacity——their unitary struc-ture and close monitoring of agents——-in fact promoted the movement-likebehavior ofstate agents.Dynamicmodelsofsocialactionviewthedecisionsofactorsasinterdependent—theyareinfluencedbychoicesreflectedintheprior ac-tionsofrelevant others.Thresholdandcriticalmass theoriesemphasizetheinterdependencies of individual choices that shift groupbehavior in waysthat do not refect the average or aggregate fixed preferences of individualsinasocial category.Theseideas alsomotivatefamiliardiffusionmodelsofpolitical events. The rate at which strikes, riots, or protests spread acrosstime and space is not affected solely by fixed structural features indicatinggroup motives or capacity to act. There is a dynamic temporal dimensionthatindicatesmutualinfuence.Aperiodofheightenedprotestactivityemerges through“imitation,comparison,the transfer of forms and themesof protest from one sector to another."58 There is typically a wave-like pat-tern in which the influence of prior actions by others eventually diminishesovertime.59Diffusion models are fundamentally about two processes: the first is howinformationistransmitted.Actorscanbeinfluencedby the actions ofothersonly if they learn of them, and the mechanisms fall into two broad typesrelational and nonrelational.6 Relational mechanisms of transmission op-erate through either local or distant social networks or formal organ-izations.6 Nonrelational mechanisms operate among actors who are notconnected through networks or formal organizations—information istransmitted throughthemass media.°Forpresentpurposesthequestionofhowinformation is transmitted is not much of a puzzle.The actors de-scribedwere awashininformationtransmittedviamassmediathatwereuniform throughout the country and through the formal bureaucratic

THEIMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE103hierarchy ofthestate.There were,in addition,face-to-facesocialnetworkscreated by the travel of Red Guards across the country and the constantparticipation of cadres in meetings at different levels in the governmenthierarchy.Of much greaterrelevance to our present case is the second preoccupa-tionofdiffusionmodels——howactorsevaluatetheinformationtheyreceiveand how and why they act on it. In some analyses of collective action andprotest, the prior occurrence of a type of protest event signals the vulner-abilityof authoritiestoachallenge,and thelikelihood that a similarchal-lenge of their own might be successful, something that affects the propen-sity to act.63 In other analyses, what is transmitted is information abouteffective techniques of organization or strategies of protest, which are sub-sequently imitated by similarly motivated actors.64Most diffusion models appear to assume that the preferences of actorsare given——individuals' propensity to act on these shared preferences shiftsin response to the actions of others.In this case,however, what shifts isnot the propensity to act on political preferences. Instead, we observe a shiftin political preferences.In a trivial sense, of course, the preferences of individualcadresarestable—theywanttosurvivetheupheaval.Whatshiftsdecisively,however,arethechoices theymake andthepoliticalorientationsthat they adopt in pursuit of this end. Active or passive support of one'ssuperiors shifts toward criticism and eventually open rebellion.The shift isespeciallypronouncedinthecase of theScarletGuards,manyofwhomreversedcourse andbecame among themost active andeffective critics oftheir superiors after having defended them for many weeks.As the politicalcontext shifted, they had the most urgent reasons to turn against theinsuperiors.In my analysis, I have portrayed a top-down process of diffusion, es-sentially a form of collective behavior by party-state cadres. Rebellionsamong the cadres grew in response to signals emanating from Beijing inthe wake of the OctoberParty Conference.This signaled to allcadres inthehierarchy that the actions of their superiorswere viewed inBeijing asmanifestations of a “bourgeois reactionary line.”The next shift in the na-tional political context was the favorable publicity given to the Shanghaipower seizure in early January, which stimulated internal rebellions bycadres, culminating in the January 22 call for rebels to seize power in imi-tation of Shanghai. This touched off a top-down wave of power seizures104AGENTS OF DISORDERacross the country, one that was accelerated by a power seizure at the im-mediatelyhigherlevelin thebureaucratichierarchy.When apowerseizureoccurredinaprovinceor aprefectureabove alocalgovernmentjurisdic-tion, this immediately placed pressures on local cadres to act and ensurean opportunity to control their own fate.I have built up this portrayal through a close examination of selectedlocal narrative accounts of cadre rebellion and power seizures, along withan examination of broad descriptive patterns in the data set. Is such a pat-ternreflected systematicallyin the data set asa whole?Elsewhere,theanalysis presented herehas been evaluated morerigorously with event his-tory models, applied to the entire data set that predicts the timing of localpower seizures.65 Here I will summarize the results of that analysis.The model estimates conform closely to my descriptive analysis. Overallthecitiesexperiencedpowerseizuresbeforethe counties.However,powerseizures were not delayed by either distance from the next higher level ofgovernment or by the percentage of cadres in the nonagricultural laborforce.In other words,distant counties with small, cadre-dominant work-forces did not experience power seizures later than less remote and moreurbanizedcounties closer to administrative centers.The top-down pres-sures that spurred power seizures operated uniformly across lower-leveljurisdictions.The crucial test of the idea that power seizures spread in a top-down cas-cade is the contrast in the impact of a power seizure at the next higherlevel of government in the periods before and after January 22. Earlier(Figure 4.1) we saw that power seizures spread slowly before January 22,but accelerated rapidly in response to signals from Beijing issued on thatday.Event history models confirm that this decisively altered the dynamicsofpower seizures.In theperiodpriortoJanuary22,powerseizures weremore likely in a locality if one occurred nearby at the same level in the gov-ernment hierarchy.66 But a power seizure in the immediately higher levelof government had no discernible impact. During this initial period, inother words,relativelyfamiliar diffusionmechanismswereevident,withnearbyeventsinfuencinglocalpoliticsin amanner often observedin otherpoliticalsettings.After January 22, top-down infuences within the state hierarchy over-whelmed local infuences, and the earlier pattern was reversed.After thisdate,theprobabilitythatalocalitywouldexperienceapowerseizurewas

The dashed line traces the impactof a higher-level power seizure before January 22.

In a manner ofspeaking,the statebureaucracydestroyeditself,as cadres atall levels turnedagainst their own superiors. This was not interest group behavior, but in-steadacascadingseriesofactsbyindividualsofthekindpositedinthresholdand critical mass models of collective behavior. Interest group behavior, tobe sure, was evident at certain points in time. The Scarlet Guard mobiliza-tion that was designed to protect bureaucrats and their offices from inva-sions by outside rebel groups is a clear example. However, the cascadingdefectionsofcadresinitiatedinthewakeoftheOctoberPartyConferencemarked an end to this instance of interest group politics, initiating a dynamicprocess that undermined state structures in a growing wave. The processculminated in the celebrated Shanghai power seizure, and was acceleratedby Beijing's January 22 declarations, creating pressures that spurred cadresto overthrow their superiors and effectively destroy structures of civilianauthorityacrossthecountry.The rapid and extensive spread of power seizures went far beyond whatcould be accounted for by local popular insurgencies, which had not pre.viously advancedveryfar outside provincial capitals and large cities.Some-what paradoxically, the rapid spread of power seizures outside the largecities was due primarily to internal rebellions by party-state cadres.

It is impossible to explain the speedand extensive reach of the wave of power seizures, not to mention their dis-tinctive top-down pattern of diffusion,without reference to the activitiesof rebels within the structure of theparty-state.

THE IMPLOSION OF THE PARTY-STATE107This wave of power seizures represented the collapse of China's civilianstate.Party organizations were decapitated and they no longer functioned.A variety of new actors, representing a range of students,workers, and cadrerebels, laid claim to government authority, and they now had to defendthese claims. Rebels who were left out of power seizures, or preempted byrivals,typicallyrefused torecognizethese claims,and immediately con-tested them. Cadres had played a central role in the destruction of party-state structures to which their group interests were closely tied.The axis ofconfict was about to shift fundamentally, and the most destructive andviolent phase of this political upheaval was about to begin.5THEFORMATIONOFFACTIONS

THEwAVE OF PowER SEIZURES alteredpoliticalrelationshipsacross China.New factional identities would soon form in response topower seizures, and violent warfare between these factions would becomethe primary story of the Cultural Revolution well into 1968.As detailedin this book's Chapter 1, theinitial wave of research on this period specu-latedthat thesefactional divisions weresomehow a continuationof thecon-flicts prior to the wave of power seizures.In other words, these were dis-putes between the defenders of the party system and their challengers—asexemplifiedintheconflictsbetweenrebelalliancesandScarletGuardsinthe streets of Nanjing and Shanghai in late 1966. From this perspective,the conflicts were a contest between those with interests tied to the statusquo and those who pursued grievances against it.Previously we uncovered one major problem with this interpretation.Party-state cadres,whose interests were more closely tied to the status quothan any other, were a major force in the overthrow of local governments,and they were themselves frequently divided against one another. Here Iwill address another aspect of this interpretation——the designation of fac-tions as “radical” and “conservative,” with presumably different politicalorientations toward the status quo. The lynchpin of the argument was thatthese preferences were presumably expressed in a faction's stance towardmilitary units dispatched to enforce order. Factions that supported the ef-forts of military units were deemed“conservative”because they appeared108

THE FORMATION OF FACTIONS109to yearn for the restoration of order.Factions that continued to resist mili-tary units were deemed“radical,”because they stubbornly opposed the res-torationoforder andwantedtokeeptheirrebellion alive.My alternative explanation does not presume that the foundation forthefactions canbefound in the social andpoliticalpositionsofactivistsprior to the fall of local governments. Instead, they emerged through anobservable series of path-dependent interactions among rival rebel groupsand military units that intervened in the wake of power seizures. The fac.tions, in other words, did not express collective orientations that were fixedby the social or political categories of their individual members. Instead,they emerged out of contingent interactions among rebel groups and mili-taryunitsinadefinedperiodof time—theyweretheproductofthejointactionsof two ormore actors.After an initial period of ambiguity and uncertainty that affected all par-ties, factional identities emerged around a central axis—orientationtoward local military control. This did not express a general orientationtoward the restoration of political order, but instead a rebel faction's posi-tion relative to specific actions taken by military officers during this for-mativeperiod.Factionalorientationtowardmilitarycontrol,in otherwords,expressedpreferences towardtherestorationoforderonwhattermsThis is a fundamentally different portrayal of what these factional conflictswereactually about.TheRootsofRebelDivisionsThe origins of the ubiquitous splits that emerged in rebel movementsearly in 1967 are already visible in the wave of power seizures. Rebel move-ments were everywhere highly fragmented and had a pronounced“cellular”quality. This was essentially an extreme version of bloc recruitment, a pat-tern often observed in the study of social movements that achieve scale bymobilizing blocks of adherents who are tied to one another in smaller organ-izationsorsocialnetworks.Althoughblocrecruitmentfacilitatesrapidgrowth of an insurgency, it also lends itself readily to fragmentation anddivision.2Rebel groups initially formed within the organizational structures ofplaces ofwork orstudy;withinadministrative offices,workshops,academicdepartments; and even within communist party branches. The evidence fon110AGENTS OFDISORDERthis cellular structureis overwhelming.Studentrebels organizedbased onsections within their entry classes and academic departments.At PekingUniversity in October 1966,there were a reported 92 different student“fighting groups”with close to 3,0o0 members, which were aligned with 3broad rebel alliances. In the months that followed, 358 different “fightinggroups”authored essays in the university'sfactional newspapers.At nearbyPeople's University, there were no fewer than 196 separate rebel fightinggroups.3 In large cities, power seizures were carried out by alliances thatcontained scores of different rebel groups from schools, factories, and government agencies. In Zhejiang, the provincial power seizure was carried outby a coalition of more than 30 rebel organizations, including a coalition ofcadre rebels. Each of these coalitions were in turn aggregations of smallerblocs.4 Guangdong's power seizure was carried out by a coalition of morethan 20 separate rebel alliances. The fragmentation was evident even withinsingle government offices. The executive office of the Communist PartyCommittee of Guangxi, for example, had no fewer than 8 small fightinggroups among its staff on the eve of the provincial power seizure.6 The frag-mentation was equally evident in rural counties. The local party historyfor Zhenyuan County,Guizhou,stated thatin early1967,“all manner ofrebel organizations sproutedlike bamboo shoots after the spring rains,forming in each of the offices of all of the government divisions." The ac-count went on tolist by name more than 50 different rebel groups distrib-uted across government departments and enterprises, which were evenlydivided into two broader alliances.7 In December 1966, Lingui County hadmore than 50 rebel fighting groups in the county's 29 administrative de-partments; in Fusui County there were more than 80 rebel fighting groups22 of them within the county's own headquarters.8This fragmented and cellular pattern of blocmobilization played a cen-tral role in the later emergence of factions, and its impact was felt at thepoint of power seizures. We have seen that power seizures spread rapidlyin acascade-likepattern,even thoughtherewaslittleevidence ofpriorrebelcoalitions outside the largest cities in immediately preceding weeks. Mostrebel coalitionswerehastilypulledtogetherforthepurposeofseizingpower.Coalitions had little prior history of cooperation, and the leaders of thesmaller fighting groups often were unfamiliar with one another.The sheer number of rebel groups, and the speed with which power sei-zureswerecarried out,meant thatitwasvirtuallyimpossibletoinclude all

But inevitably thereweresignificantnumbersthatwereexcludedfrompowerseizuresduesimplyto the fact that there were far too many to coordinate in a brief period oftime. Pressures to act created by power seizures at the immediately higherlevel of government contributed to this pattern. The exclusion of rebels frompower seizures contained the seeds of disputes that would eventually co-alesceintomorecoherentfactions.RivalRebels:DiscordoverPowerSeizuresIn virtually every case that I am able to detail, power seizures excludedsignificant numbers of rebel groups. They objected to their exclusion al-most immediately, denouncing power seizures as “fake” or unrepresenta-tive of thebroaderrebelmovement.Theproblemwas evidenteveninShanghai's celebrated January 6 power seizure,which generated stridentopposition from major rebel organizations. This opposition came fromprominent rebels,notfromformer Scarlet Guards,whohad tried to de-fend the Shanghai authorities before turning against them in late De-cember.?AfterBeijingpublicized a congratulatory telegrampraisingtherebel power seizure in the city on January 12, the massive Scarlet Guardmovement simply collapsed, and they issued a public statement,“BeggingForgiveness from Chairman Mao,” apologizing for their previous opposi-tion to the Workers' General Headquarters. Instead, vociferous oppositionto the Shanghai power seizure came from within the city's large and di-verse rebel movement. The Workers' General Headquarters was a loose co-alition of several large “regiments” each headed by a well-known rebelworker.Several of theseregiments objected stronglywhen theyperceivedthat they were being given a subordinate position in the new power struc-ture. They protested that the new form of government was being plannedwithout their participation, and they refused orders to merge into theWorkers' General Headquarters. One of these worker regiments mobilizedto challenge these arrangements and announced the formation of their ownrivalgovernment.112AGENTS OFDISORDEREven more dramatic was militant opposition to the power seizure by thelargest studentrebel alliance,theRedRevolutionaries.These studentshadbeen themainforce oftherebel movementlongbefore workersbelatedlyjoined in near the end of November, and they protested thefact that theywere now excluded from a significant share of power. They noted thatZhang Chunqiao, the senior offcial who coordinated the power seizure andwho was now the head of the new government, was a ranking member ofthe former Shanghai Party Committee, and that he was now suppressingrebel activity and was forcing workers back to work. To them this lookedsuspiciously like the suppression of their mass movement. At a January 27meeting, they detained Zhang Chunqiao and his deputy Yao Wenyuan andheld them for two hours, trying to extract an apology for using troops tosuppress rebels. After the two were freed without making any concessions,the Red Revolutionaries kidnapped one of their top aides and held him onthe Fudan University campus. After Zhang dispatched troops to free theaide,the students distributed wallposters andhandbills across the city at-tacking Zhang for suppressing the student rebellion.The January 26 power seizure in Nanjing also generated strong opposi-tion from a disaffected wing of the city's large rebel movement.1° The pro-vincial and city governmentshad become paralyzed after the emergenceof street fighting between Scarlet Guards and worker rebels in late De-cember. After Mao's approval for the power seizures in Shanghai becameevident in early January, Nanjing's large Scarlet Guard alliance, like Shang-hai's, simply collapsed,and they were no longer active in local politics.Their last mass action was in the street fighting of January 3. Jiangsu's FirstParty Secretary sent an urgent telegram to Beijing on January 22, reportingthat the provincial party committee could no longer function, and he andother top provincial and city leaders were taken into custody by rebels. Con-cerned that the city was spiraling out of control with no end in sightyZhou Enlai contacted rebel leaders and urged them to seize power. Rebelleaders met from January 22 to 24 to plan a power seizure, but discordemerged at the meeting. The leaders of several key groups objected to thebalance of power on the power seizure committee and the“absence of de-mocracy” in the meetings. In protest, one of the city's most celebrated rebelleaders,the head of a large student alliance,withdrew from the negotiations, and others joined him. The power seizure went forward without themshortly aftermidnightonJanuary25.

THE FORMATION OFFACTIONS113Noting the split in the city's rebelmovement,ZhouEnlai hesitated tosignal his approval, andinstead summoned representatives of thetwo sidesto negotiate in Beijing. Encouraged by this, the rebels who were excludedfrom the power seizure went on the attack and denounced it.In responsethe rebelswho seized power charged that opposition to their power seizureamounted to counterrevolution.The fact that negotiations were ongoingin Beijing provoked battles on the streets of Nanjing, as leaders on eachside sought to strengthen their claims by weakening the other side. Therewere8violentstreetconfrontationsduringtheweeksthatnegotiationswereunderway. Not surprisingly, the Beijing negotiations failed to bring the twosides together. Jiangsu and the provincial capital of Nanjing were placedunder military control on March 5, and the struggle between the pro- andanti-power seizure rebels dominated the region's politics well into 1968.A similar sequence of events unfolded around the January 22 power sei-zure in Guangzhou. During the preparatory meeting to establish a powerseizureallianceonJanuary21,disagreements emergedover tactics andtiming. Several leaders of large rebel alliances argued that a power seizurewas premature—preparationsfor abroad-based alliance of rebel organ-izations had only just begun, and unity needed to be established beforemaking such an important move. The leaders of other rebel groups, how-ever, argued that they should act immediately, and that unity would comefrom the struggle to seize and consolidate power. Failing to forge an agree-ment, the leaders of a large portion of Guangzhou's rebel movement with-drew from the negotiations. The remaining rebels proceeded to seize powerthenextday.Provincial leaders, realizing that resistance was futile, welcomed therebels and negotiated an agreement whereby they would continue to oc-cupytheirpostsbutwouldforthetimebeingworkunderrebelsupervi-sion. The rebels that had withdrawn from the power seizure negotiationswerealreadyunhappythattheyhadbeenleftbehind,butnowtheyseizeduponthefactthatGuangzhou'stopofficialswerenotforcedtostepdownfrom their posts. They denounced the power seizure as“fake” and began apropaganda campaign that denounced it as a fraud for excluding largeswaths of Guangzhou's rebel movement, while permitting revisionist offi-cials to stay on the job.Several violent clashes between the rival rebel groupssoon occurred, and after an attempted “counter power seizure" on Jan-uary25，therhetorichardenedthedifferencesbetweenthetwosides.114AGENTS OF DISORDERThesedivisionswoulddefinefactional confictsinGuangzhouformonthstocome.12In Guangxi's provincial capital of Nanning, the splits did not originatefrom rivalries between rebels included and excluded from power seizures.13Instead,therebel alliancebroke apart afteritspowerseizure.Simultaneouspower seizures overbothGuangxiProvinceandNanningCityonJan-uary23werecarried outby abroad allianceof cadre,worker,and studentrebels. However, the alliance quickly fell apart over the behavior of itsleaders and by controversies over which rebel groups had more genuine rebelcredentials. The rebel group that dominated the coalition refused to acceptformerScarletGuardswhohadeventuallyturnedagainsttheirsuperiors,andtheydenouncedthem andothersasconservativeswhohadinitiallydefended local authorities. Other rebel groups in the coalition objected tothelackofconsultationwithotherrebelleadersabout these actions.Thissplittherebel coalition,and thosewhowithdrewformedrivalalliances.Inlate February this new rebel alliance dispatched more than a thousand ac-tivistsin50truckstoattackthepowerseizurecommittee'sheadquartersThis split Nanning's rebel movement into two antagonistic camps, and eachside moved to consolidate its position and reorganize its forces, campaigningagainstoneanotherinwallpostersandhandbills.A range of different event sequences led to similar outcomes at the sub-provincial level. Minor variations on this theme are described in detailedaccounts from three Guangxi Prefectures—Yulin, Bose, and Guilin. TheJanuary 24powerseizureinYulin,whichwas carried outby cadrerebelsintheprefecture administration,fell apartbecause of arivalrybetweencadres who seized power and an alliance of worker rebels who were left out.The excluded rebels immediately denounced it as“fake.”They called to-gether other rebels from close tofifty small rebel groups, and on January 29they invaded the prefecture's administrative offices to seize power. Thepower seizure committee collapsed, and on February 8, the workers? alli-ance declared a second power seizure.14The power seizure in Bose Prefecture fell apart even though cadre rebelshad included a broad range of outside rebel groups. Cadres in the prefec-ture offices coordinated the power seizure by reaching out to student andworker rebels, and pulled together an alliance of 69 small rebel organ-izations. The next day, 13 rebel groups that had been excluded from thepower seizure sent representatives to protest.The power seizure committeeTHE FORMATION OFFACTIONS

115charged that the challenge was a “conspiracy to overthrow the power sei-zure,”declared the group's handbills“counterrevolutionary,” and seizedmore than 20 leaders of the rebel opposition for humiliating public strugglesessions,placing them under arrest.After widespread protests about theseactions, the power seizure committee made a public apology and releasedthe prisoners,but the divisions remained.15The power seizure in Guilin Prefecture fell apart primarily due to divi-sions among cadre rebels in the prefecture offices. The power seizure wascoordinated by an alliance of cadre rebels who pulled together a coalitionthat included student Red Guards and worker rebels. The problem was thatalmost every one of the offices in the prefecture party and government ad-ministration had at least two active groups of cadre rebels, and the powerseizure had been carried out hurriedly, without pulling together a broadalliance across the prefecture offices. The excluded groups objected. More-over, the rebels in the power seizure committee themselves fell into disagree.ments, and those who felt that their views were being ignored began todissent as well. Both began to argue that the power seizure was carried outwithoutsufficient consultation.Some ofthosewhospokeoutwerepres-sured, followed, and detained, deepening local antagonisms.16Further variations on this theme were evident atthe county level.InTiandong County, rebels in the county's security bureau had hurriedlyorganized a power seizure on January 26,precisely in order to preventoutside rebels from doing so.The excluded outside groups,including somecadrerebels,objected.They denounced thepower seizure as unrepresenta-tive, and in violation of Beijing's directives. They refused to acknowledgeits authority, and commenced a wall poster campaign that denouncedthe power seizure as a“counterrevolutionary” act by a small group ofconspirators.A second power seizure was declared a week later by a largeralliance.17In Gongcheng County,cadre rebels decided to push ahead with a powerseizure on January28 and only afterwardsbuild up a broader coalition oflocal rebel groups. Predictably, the excluded rebels objected immediately,andvigorous debate ensued.Widespreadresistanceparalyzed thepower sei-zure committee within days.18 In Wuxuan and Luzhai counties, powerseizuresledby cadrerebelswereimmediatelydenounced as“palacecoupsand “fake power seizures” by rebel groups excluded from the act, and bothsides mobilized to defend their positions.1InLingshan County, after a116AGENTS OFDISORDERpower seizure organized by cadre rebels,student and worker rebels bargedinto their first meeting and denounced the power seizure, subjecting itsleaders to struggle sessions and putting dunce caps on their heads. The ac-tion split local rebels.2° Opposition to the power seizure in Lingui Countywas expressed at the very moment that it was being carried out.A rival rebelgroup crashed the meeting where cadre rebels were planning a powerseizure,and immediately denounced it as“fake.”Their main objectionwasthatthe alliance'sleadersincludedcadreswhohadbeenScarletGuardsbefore turning against their superiors. The power seizure committeecounterattacked.2lThese case descriptions illustrate the local processes that generated di-visions in rebel movements precipitated by power seizures. These splits ap-pear to have been almost universal, but they had yet to coalesce into twoclearlydefined andrelativelycoherentfactions.Thiswould comelater,anda key event in crystallizing coherent factions was the intervention of mili-taryunitsthatwereorderedtosupportlocalpowerseizures.TheProblemofRebelPowerThese narratives make painfully clear that rebels who seized power lackedthe ability to enforce their claimswhether they were coalitions of populaninsurgentsandcadrerebelsorcadrerebelswhoactedalone.Withouttheability to legitimately use force against challengers,political power wouldremain contested and unenforceable.Anticipating this fact, near the endof January, shortly after the call for rebels to seize power, Mao ordered mili-tary support for the rebels who responded to this call.Troops were or-dered to support“genuine leftists”who had seized power from local gov-ernments.22Fromthispointforwardlocalpoliticalconflictspivotedawayfrom attacks on local party-state authorities to a new issue: the consolida-tion of a power seizure. For the first time in the Cultural Revolution, armyunits were thrust into the middle of civilian political conflicts.Militaryinterventionwasintendedtoconsolidaterebelpowerinthemanner that was achieved successfully in Shanghai. The order for militarysupport had two objectives. On the one hand, military units were to en-sure that rebel insurgents were able to unseat incumbent party and gov-ernment leaders. On the other hand, they were also to ensure that the po-litical upheaval did not throw public order and China's planned economyinto disarray.23 The potential economic damage was magnified by the fact

THE FORMATION OFFACTIONS117that government agencies played a central coordinating role in all economicactivity—industrial,agricultural,andcommercial.Muchmorethanin amarket economy, the paralysis of government agencies would have a largeand immediate economic impact. The tension between these twoobjectives—consolidating rebel power while stabilizing local order—became evident asthe armedforces soughttofulfil theirmission.This tension was exacerbated by conflicting political priorities amongthe surviving national leaders under Mao Zedong. The civilian radicals whosupplanted veteran party leaders in the initial Beijing purges, and uponwhomMaorelied tolaunchthe Cultural Revolution,were overwhelminglypreoccupied with ensuring that genuine“leftists”replaced local leaders thatthey suspected of revisionism. Zhou Enlai, however, along with many vet-eran military commanders,was more preoccupied with ensuring that thedisorders did not undermine the planned economy, public order, and na-tional security(theUnitedStateswasescalatingtheVietnamWaronChi-na's southern border). Mao Zedong sought tomodulate the conflict betweenthese two objectives,shiftingback and forth in the months to come between support for rebellion and for the military's consolidation of order.The shifting directives from Beijing served to crystallize and harden localfactionalconflicts.The orders,issued to thePeople's Liberation Army (PLA)on January 28,were broad and vague.As a“proletarian revolutionary army,”the PLAshould stand on the side of the“revolutionary masses of the left”and serveas“an instrument of proletarian dictatorship.”Previously the PLA was for-bidden from interfering with rebel insurgencies but now, the documentdeclared, the only question is on which side the PLA stands.Military officers were told to“resolutely support the genuine revolutionary left,” butthey were also ordered to“resolutely oppose rightists and counterrevolu-tionaries and counterrevolutionary organizations" and to “take necessarymeasures against them."Oneclearly statedtaskwas to"safeguardproduc-tion and normal work."What were military commanders to conclude iflocalrebelspersisted inactivitiesthat disrupted“production andnormalwork"? What if rebels resisted military units when they proceeded to carryout their orders? The juxtaposition of these prohibitions, and the order to“resolutely oppose rightists and counterrevolutionaries" and “take neces-sary measures against them,” seemed to suggest a firm hand in dealing withpersistently disruptive rebels.24 This required soldiers to make political judgments in the feld, without clear guidelines; inevitably, it forced military118AGENTS OF DISORDERofficers to choose winners and losers in active rebel disputes over powerseizures.TheReachofMilitaryInterventionSystematicandwidespreadmilitaryinterventionwasfacilitatedbyChina's deeply intertwined civilian and military hierarchies. Regional forceswere dispersed around thecountryin29military districts(jun diqu),whichwere divided into subdistricts (jun fen diqu). Military districts were largelycoterminous withprovinces;military sub-districtswithprefectures.Theyhaddetachmentsoftroopsonlocal bases.Below theprefectureswereGar-rison Commands (weisbu qu) in large cities, and People's Armed Depart-ments(renminwuzhuangbu)incountiesandsmallercities.People'sArmedDepartments did not have full-time troops, but they led local militias (minbing) consisting of reserve forces with stockpiles of light weapons. Sepa-rate“mainforce”combatunitswerenottiedtogovernmentjurisdictions.There were 36 army corps under the command of 13 large Military Re-gions (jun qu). These forces were jointly under the Military Region head-quarters and the Central Military Commission.They included mainlineinfantry forces,as well as specialized armored,artillery, air force, and (alongthe coast)naval divisions.Detachmentsfrom these forces could be calledupon for domestic political tasks as needed,and they were indeed calledupon repeatedly in the months to come.25The structure and distribution of army units facilitated widespread mil-itary intervention to “support the left." Figure 5.1 traces the cumulativepercentage of cities and counties, by month, of local intervention by mili-tary units.26 Military intervention was extensive and rapid, reaching thevastmajorityoflocaljurisdictionsbyMarch.Themilitaryhadintervenedin 90 percent of all cities by April. Counties lagged somewhat behind, butreached 80 percent by May. The coverage of“military support”was remark-ably complete.

If military officers supported the claims of those who had declareda power seizure (as implied in their orders), they immediately earned theopposition of rebels who contested that power seizure. This could place thearmed forces in a virtual alliance with one faction, which warmly applaudedthe military's stance. It also turned rebels who opposed power seizures intoopponents of military intervention—not as a matter of political principlebutbecause the armydidnotsupport their side.Even if military forces initially tried to maintain strict neutrality in localfactionalrivalries,they couldinadvertentlybecome entangled inthembecause of their neutrality.Rebels who had seized power viewed a neutralstance as a failure to support their legitimate claims—essentially a stanceof nonrecognition. They also suspected that a neutral stance implicitly cred-ited the claims of rivalrebels.A noncommittalstancewas applauded bygroups opposed to the power seizure, because it essentially refused to ac-knowledgetheclaimsofthosewhohadseizedpower.When in these circumstances military units tried to maintain the normaloperations of factories,public services, and local infrastructure,they often120AGENTS OFDISORDERmetwithresistance.Whentheymovedtoimposecontrol overradiostations,train depots, courts, banks, post offices and public security organs, rebelgroups that controlled them frequently resisted, clashing with soldiers, andthis deepened their antagonism with the military. The fragmented nature ofrebel coalitions made these kinds of conflicts more likely.There was little ap-parent prior preparation by rebel groups to establish a unified and consistentposition regarding military intervention. If a rebel fighting group in charge ofa bank or a railway station got into a confrontation with an army unit, otherrebelsinthecoalitioncouldbepulledintoconflictwithlocal commanders.When militaryunits met with rebel opposition,they had to decidehowto respond. Even when they declared neutrality in local rebel rivalries, theystillwereforced todefend themselveswhenrebelsresisted their moves toexercise control over local installations that were crucial to maintainingpublic order and the operations of the planned economy. In some regionsmilitary units responded with arrests and thebanning of entirerebelgroups.Provinces,Cities,andPrefecturesActs of resistance by rebels to army actions——and army responses—areevident in local annals. There were 122 reported confrontations with armyunits initiated by rebel groups during the first four months of 1967. Thereis even more evidence during this period of the suppression of rebel groupsbyeither thearmedforcesorbythosewhoclaimedtohaveseizedpower.There were only 12 such reported events in January 1967, but there were181inFebruary and March.It is likely that there were many similar ac-tionsinotherjurisdictionsthatwerenotreportedinlocalannals.These developments were especially clear in provincial capitals. In Nan-jing, after February negotiations conducted in Beijing failed to reconcilethe divided rebels, Jiangsu Province was put under military control in earlyMarch.27 Troops from the Jiangsu Military District moved into Nanjingand other major cities.When they tried to take over key communication,transportation, and other sites, they met with resistance from rebels thathad carried out the power seizure in those units. The troops responded witharrests of hundreds of rebels who forcibly resisted military control. Therebels who had carried out the power seizure referred to this as the “MarchSuppression."These rebels viewed military control as an overthrow of theinlegitimate power seizure, while the rebels who had objected to the power

THEFORMATION OF FACTIONS121seizuresaw the army's moves as avindication oftheirclaims,and applaudedthe army's actions. The arrests became a major political issue for that wingoftherebelmovement,andreinforcedtheirviewthatthe armywas theretosuppresslegitimaterebels.In Guangzhou, violent confrontations over the power seizure occurredwithin days of the event, and the rebels who carried it out charged thattheir opponents were counterrevolutionaries.28 In late January, troops fromthemilitary district moved in to take control ofkey sites inthe city.Theywere under strictorderstotake a neutral stance,andnot dislodgetherebelgroups.Although one wing of the rebel movement had declared a powerseizure over theprovincialandmunicipal administrations,rivalrebels stillcontrolled a number of units across the city.When, in early February, rebelsaffliated with the power seizure attacked the radio station to dislodge rebelsopposed to the power seizure, the troops on site helped them to repel theinvaders.This convinced the rebelswho had seized power that the armydid not support their claims, and they staged a mass protest at the militaryregion headquarters, invading the building, putting up wall posters, cut-ting telegraph lines, and detaining several officers.Finally, Guangdong wasput under military control in mid-March, and the armed forces quicklymoved to suppress the rebels in the power seizure alliance who had resistedthem with force. In actions later called the “March Black Wind,” close to1,200 rebels were arrested,more than16,000 rebels were registered as mem-bers of “reactionary organizations,” and several rebel alliances that werepart of the power seizure were banned as illegal. The exercise of militarycontrol in Guangzhou turned the military region's forces into virtual alliesofonewingoftherebelmovement,despitetheirinitialintention toremainneutral. A similar sequence of events occurred in Wuhan.29Patterns in provincial capitals were replicated at the sub-provincial level,althoughthemilitary's entanglementinlocal rebelrivalries came about ina variety of different ways. In the northern Jiangsu prefecture of Xuzhou,the armed forces became deeply involved in localfactional politics,despitetheir recognition of the power seizure and its rapid move to certify it as arevolutionarycommittee.30Whilepreparingtocertifythepowerseizureas a revolutionary committee, some of the rebel groups in the coalitionchafed atmilitary authority,andwantedaleadingrole thatwas independent of army tutelage. When the leaders of one rebel group criticized thearmy's moves, its leaders were arrested and the organization banned. When122AGENTS OFDISORDERother rebelleaders charged that thepunishments were excessive,they toowere arrested and banned. By mid-March the army had banned 34 rebelgroups, arrested close to 150 leaders, and placed several thousand rebels“under supervision.”Some rebel groups complied with the army's authorityreluctantly,but others enthusiastically approved of the army's moves. Thisdivided the rebels who initially were allies in the power seizure into twoantagonistic groups,now defined by their differentresponses to the army'sactionsasitpreparedtocertifyanewregionalgovernment.CountiesIn the cities,military control usually took place in the context of largeand diverse rebel coalitions. In counties rebel movements were smaller, andcadrerebelsinthecountyadministrationplayedadominantroleinpowerseizures.We have already seen that disagreements over power seizures werealmost as common in counties as in the large cities. In counties, however,the local People's Armed Department (PAD) played a much more directrolein sorting outfactional disputes,and they insinuated themselves moredeeplyintolocalpolitics.Theheadof the countyPADalmostinvariablywas amember of thecounty's party leadership, though rarely among the top-ranking members.In many cases the PAD head had only recently been appointed to the postontheeveoftheCulturalRevolution.31TheJanuary28ordersregardingmilitary support for power seizures essentially made local PAD heads theonlymembersofacounty'sleadershipthatwereimmunefromoverthrow,andinfact turned theminto arbiters oflocal disputes amongrebels.Theywere initially the only figures with any authority to make decisions and en-force them.Rebel groups turned to the PAD to support their respectivepositions in disputes about power seizures.When the PAD threw its sup-port behind one group oflocal rebels, the rebels whose claims they deniedinvariably claimed that they had a conservative bias against“genuine”rebels.Whiletheywere obviouslyvulnerabletosuch a claim,thehead ofthelocalPADfaced thesamedilemmas asPLAunitsdidinlargerjuris-dictions. They may well have preferred cadre rebels over others, but theyusually faced a choice between rival groups of cadre rebels, and their ac-tions as describedinhistorical accountsindicatethattheirdecisionsde-

THE FORMATION OFFACTIONS123pended on a range of contingent events. Like military units elsewhere, theyoftenvacillated and shifted supportfrom one group to another, trying toforge a coalition that would stabilize the locality.In Cangwu County, Guangxi, the PAD set up a “support the left” office even before the power seizure by a large rebel alliance. When a rebelalliancewithinthecountyadministrationrefusedtoacknowledgethepower seizure and appealed to the PAD for support, they counseled thecadre rebels that the power seizure was indeed legitimate and in accord withBeijing's policies. The cadre rebels persisted in their objections, and con-ducted a campaign against the power seizure that prevented it from exer-cising power. In the interim, the PAD head set up a production commandpost. The propaganda war between the two rebel groups continued, whilethe PAD continued to administer the county. Gradually the PAD's attitudetoward the original power seizure cooled, and they convinced several keyleaders to withdraw from the power seizure alliance and join together withthe dissident cadrerebels.Under thePAD's direction,they formed a newalliance,which made them backers of one party to the evolving confict.32Shortly after Beiliu County's power seizure, the PAD was thrust intothe middle of rebel disputes.The power seizure was carried out by cadrerebels in the county offices. To prevent paralysis, the PAD moved in onFebruary 5 to set up a command center. A week later certain rebels in thepublic security system and other county departments declared that a localrebel organization contained“bad elements”and was counterrevolutionary.They banned it and seized two of its leaders. The PAD tried to defuse thesituation, stating that mass organizations could not arbitrarily be declaredcounterrevolutionary.Therebels on the power seizure committee split overthe PAD's stance,and those who disagreed withdrew from the power sei-zure andformedarivalalliance.Thepower seizurecommitteepromptlycollapsed, leaving the PAD's command center as the only effective authorityin the county. Shortly thereafter, the rebel alliance whose “counterrevolu-tionary”label had been disputed by thePAD,counterattacked against itsprimary accusers,invading their offices andimprisoning theirleaders.ThePAD approved of the action, which drew them into support for one side inBeiliu's ongoing factional struggles.33The head of Lingyun County's PAD directly orchestrated a power sei-zure.Near the endofJanuary,cadre rebelsinthe county administration124AGENTS OFDISORDERmettoelectapowerseizurecommittee,buttheydisagreedabouthowtotreat the county's Party Secretary,delaying their deliberations.The headof the county PAD argued that a delay might permit outside rebels to seizepower first, and he worked with one of the rebel groups to form a new powerseizure committee.

Military officers were forced to assess a local political situation andmake judgments about which course of action would facilitate the suc-cessful fulfillment of their assigned task. They did not automatically sup-port a group that had declared a power seizure, and often tried to remainneutral. Their stances toward a local group—whether or not it had seizedpower—depended on the reaction of that group toward them.They oftentried initially to remain neutral, and could be drawn reluctantly into analignment with one wing of the divided rebel forces. They often hesitatedto choose sides, and could switch their support from one group to anotherin reaction to local developments. They would decisively respond whenrebel groups resisted them by force, arresting leaders and banning organ-izations—an action that could create irreversible schisms with onewing ofthe rebel movement, while drawing their rivals into a tighter alignment withthe military. Rebel groups, for their part, responded to military units pri-marilybased onwhether they perceived that their actions supported theinstanceinlocal disputes.Thiswastrue whether theyhad seizedpower orhad been excluded from the power seizure. The eventual alignment of rebelfactions for and against military units was the contingent outcome of theseinteractions. The emerging political orientationswho ended up on whichside—were the product of joint actions by two parties,not the expressionofinterestsdefinedunilaterallybeforetheperiodofinterest.

THE FORMATION OFFACTIONS125There was an undeniable random element in determining which rebelsended up on which side of emerging factional divisions.But the mecha-nismsthatcreatedthedivisions andalignedrebelgroupsforand againstthe military are observable and lend themselves readily to explanation.Aninteresting feature of these processes is that a wide variety of local interac-tions allleadtowardasingleoutcome—factions alignedwith,andagainstmilitary forces. This is an example of a “robust” multi-level process:collective-leveloutcomes arenotdependenton the specificform ofmicro-level processes.35 In these instances, the formation of factions with differentorientations tomilitary control did not depend on the specific sequence ofinteractionbetweenrebels andsoldiers.Itdidnotmatterwhichsidethearmysupported;howthey came tothisdecision;whichrebelsseizedpowerfirst, or which were left out. All of these interactions converged on a singleoutcome: factions with opposed preferences regarding military control.The processes that are described here are an example of what Tilly de-fined as“category formation” in collective conflicts, which generate foun-dations for political identities——-ways to identify oneself and one's allies indistinction from others. These categories form the basis for “stories” thatthe resulting groups tell about themselves and others——in this case, narra-tives about the correct or incorrect actions of other rebel groups, and thecorrect or incorrect actions of local military commanders.36 Confict pro-cesses of this sort bring previously unrelated individuals into closer asso-ciation, based on their shared antagonism toward military units and theirfavored rebel groups.37 As conflict grows, the ties that bind these individ-ualstogetherstrengthen.38In terms of social networks, the emerging pattern of relationships amongrebel groups and military units represent a realignment of local social tiesbased on“structural equivalence"——the occupation of equivalent positionsin local networks that create common interests among individuals or smallgroups that previously had no ties with one another.39 The collapse of localgovernments in the wake of power seizures, and of the formally organizednetworks of local party organizations, sorted rebels who were included inandexcludedfrompowerseizuresintostructurallyequivalentpositions.Rebels who were excluded from power seizures found themselves with oneattributein common:their exclusionfrom,andoppositionto,power sei-zures.Aspolitical interactions evolved in the wake of militaryintervention

AGENTS OF DISORDER126new political categories emerged that became the basis for factionalidentities——rebels whose claims were supported by the military, and thosewhoseclaimswerenot.Thiswas thecontextinwhichhighlyfragmentedrebelmovementsbegantocoherefor thefirsttimeintomoresolidary andself-consciousfactions.Thefragmentation due to the ubiquitous pattern of blocrecruitment beganto reverse itself. In many regions, under the right circumstances, this re-sulted in much more disciplined and coherent factions that would later de-velop specialized combat units. Power seizures served as a catalyst forcloser alignment among the smaller rebel groups included in power seizures,as they drew together to defend their claims against rival rebels. Disparaterebel groups that were excluded from power seizures also drewtogether topress their claims and protest their exclusion. The interventions of militaryactors crystallized these emerging new factions, often inadvertently, andtheir actions hardened these emerging new identities and further promotedtheirinternalsolidarity anddisciplineAs each side sought to draw others who were in structurally equivalentpositionsintotighter alignment,they alsobegantorecruitother citizenswho were not previously aligned with rebel factions into their fold.Thesewere, in a sense, rival local governments in formation, in a situation ofdeeply contested sovereignty. For the first time each side began to settle ona single name for their emerging alliances, and they began to develop narratives about local conflicts that portrayed their rivals in a negative light,while justifying their own past actions and present stances. These narra-tiveswere expressed in petitions sent tohigher authorities,in handbills andwall posters issued locally, and in some regions by periodically publishedbulletins and news sheets. These processes account for the somewhat anom-alous growth of factional rivalries after power seizures and militaryintervention—widespread combat between rebel factions developed onlyafterwardsinmostregionsofChina.These were the structural bases and interactive processes that generatedthepoliticalidentitiesthatwouldspawnfactionalwarfareinmanyChi-nese regions. We now turn to the process of consolidating larger and morecoherent political factions,and the emergence of organizedviolence be-tweenthem.6oTHEEMERGENCEOFFACTIONALWARFARE

DISPUTES AMONG REBELS IN THE WAKE of power seiZures wereubiquitous. They were an inevitable product of the fragmented and cellularstructure ofrebelinsurgencies,andofthe rapid downward diffusion ofpower seizures in the national political hierarchy. In localities where anew structure of political authority was created quickly and certified byBeijing——as in Shanghai——these disputes were unlikely to coalesce into largeandantagonisticfactional alliances,andfactionalwarfarewasunlikelytoemerge.When a newstructure ofpower—a“revolutionary committee"received the direct sanction of Beijing, military units defused oppositionrelatively quickly in support of new structures of political power.In the vast majority of Chinese provinces,however, a revolutionary com-mittee certified by Beijing would not be established for well over a year.These regions were instead placed under military control, forcing militaryofficers to operate on their own. They intervened in the midst of festeringrebel disputes, and they inevitably inserted themselves into the middle oflocal conflicts.Theinitialimpact ofmilitaryinterventionwas toshifttheaxes oflocal conflictsfromdisputes amongrebels over thepower seizureto stances of support or opposition tomilitary authority.Thesewere newfactions, defined by a rebel group's initial position relative to local powerseizures,andbytheirevolvingrelationshipswithmilitaryunits.Figure 6.1 traces the emergence of factions relative to power seizures andmilitary intervention.

NeitherpowerseizurenormilitaryinterventionFigure 6.2.Kaplan-MeierProbabilities for the Formation of Factionsare ignored, in particular regional political developments, which becomeincreasingly important over time. The trend lines show that localities thatexperienced both power seizures and military intervention developed opposedfactionsfaster and more extensively than localities that experiencedneither.Localities that experienced eitber a power seizure or military inter-vention alone generated factions at roughly the same pace. But they did somore slowly and less extensively than localities that experienced both, andmore rapidly and extensively than localities that experienced neither.2ExplainingtheEmergenceofFactionalWarfareClearly, military intervention did not curtail the development of fac-tions, and appears instead to have contributed to its development.But thisfalls well short of a satisfying explanation for the development of violentfactional warfare.We need to examine more closely the timing of signalsemanating from Beijing,which decisively influenced the actions of bothmilitary units and rebel groups during the periods when factional identi-ties solidified and their violent antagonisms first emerged.130AGENTSOFDISORDERThefirst andmost important of these signals was a drastic reversal inthe military's orders in early April 1967, which prevented local army unitsfrom taking direct action against rebel groups that opposed their decisions.A simple interpretation of this reversal is that this altered political oppor-tunity structures to permit dissident rebels to pursue their objections to thedecisions ofmilitarycommanders.Butsuch aninterpretationwouldmissan equally important consequence. If military units were no longer able tosuppress rebel opposition, and if dissident rebels now seized the opportu-nity to organize and mobilize to press their claims, rebels who benefitedfrom and supported therecent decisions of military officers were now com-pelled to mobilize to defend their stances, and in particular to defend thearmed forces. The reversal of the orders under which military units oper-atedhastenedtheformationoffactions andeventuallyservedtogenerateviolentwarfarebetweenthem,unrestrainedbymilitaryunits.Thereasonsfor this reversal arewellunderstood.Radical figuresinBei-jing, who had supported and steered rebel movements in late 1966 andhad helped to orchestrate regional power seizures in Shanghai and else-where, became alarmed about the actions of military units during Feb-ruary and March. They began to suspect that the army was bringing theCultural Revolution to a premature end without fundamental transforma-tions of thekindtheyfelttheyhad achieved inShanghai.Thesesameradical figures were willing to rely on military force to suppress oppositionto revolutionary committees that had their approval. Zhang Chunqiao, whonow headed Shanghai's Revolutionary Committee, openly acknowledgedthis when he said that anyone who challenged his seizure of power“wouldautomatically be labeled a counterrevolutionary and arrested."3 Similar sup-pressions of rebel opposition to provincial power seizures occurred in Hei-longjiang, Guizhou,Shandong, and Shanxi, the other provinces where newrevolutionary committees were approved between January and March 1967.There was little elite disagreement in Beijing about these outcomes. Maoandhisradical associatesviewedthem asvictoriesfortheirmovement,whileZhouEnlaiwelcomedthisasarestorationoforder andtheendtodisrup-tions of theplanned economy.Disagreements arose over the remaining 23 provinces where a revolu-tionary committee had yet tobe approved. There were two common rea-sonsfor this delay.First,therewas nolocalleader acceptabletoMao andhis radical subordinates and alsodeemed suffciently seniortohead an en-THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE

131tire province. Second, rebel alliances were too deeply and evenly dividedto forge an agreement to support new arrangements. After a frenetic earlyeffort toresolve the disputes that had alreadybroken out over provincialpower seizures, Beijing placed one province after another under militarycontrol.5Although the Central Cultural Revolution Group,staffed by youngerradical figures,had become a powerful forceinBeijingby thispointin time,Zhou Enlai convened and chaired the group's meetings and still wieldedthe surviving machinery of government. Zhou was an active proponent ofpower seizures as a means to restore a rapidly deteriorating economy andpublic order, and he urged rebels in Nanjing, Guangzhou, and elsewheretoseizepower shortly after the eventsinShanghai.6Suspicious of Zhou'smotives,Beijingradicalswere alsodisturbedby trendsintheprovincesthatwere placed under military control.They were initially sympathetic tocharges by the large rebel alliances left out of the power seizures in Guang-dong and Jiangsu—-that the power seizures were “fake."7Reports from some provinces reinforced their suspicion that the armedforces were suppressing genuine rebels. In Sichuan, two large rebel organ-izationslaid siege to theheadquarters of theChengduMilitaryRegion forone week, and in response the commander ordered the arrest of tens ofthousands of rebels across the province. An unarmed student was shot andkilled while demonstrating at an army post in Inner Mongolia, and 169rebel protesterswerekilled and 179 wounded during a confrontation inXining, the capital of Qinghai province.8 Hunan's provincial capital ofChangsha was placed under martial law in early February, and local troopssuppressed a large rebel organization that had attacked an army commandpost, arresting some 10,000 rebels.? These events bred suspicion that re-gional military commanders were hostile to rebels and were prematurelyshutting down an insurgency that was to bring about China's politicaltransformation.Developments in Beijing intensified worries about the political sympa-thies of army commanders.An angry confrontation at a leadership meetingin mid-February pitted senior PLA marshals against radical members ofthe CentralCulturalRevolution Group.Severalmarshals angrilyde-nounced them for attacking veteran revolutionaries and throwing Chinainto chaos.Mao was informed of the confrontation and responded byordering the marshals to step down from their posts. The incident was132AGENTS OFDISORDERpublicized to rebel organizations across the country,who expressed outrageover this“anti-Mao"incident and the attempts of certain military leaders tosuppress their movement.1° The strident propaganda campaign against se-nior military figures signaled to rebels across the country that militaryauthorities could legitimately be opposed, and that there was support forsuchoppositioninBeijingThese developments culminated in an abrupt reversal of the army'sorders. The initial directive had given them the authority to act decisivelyagainst “counterrevolutionary” organizations. Two directives from Beijingdrastically reformulated these orders on April 1. They prohibited militaryunits from condemning any rebel organization as“counterrevolutionary"All rebel groups previously banned were tobe recognized as legitimate, andtheir arrested memberswere tobereleasedfromprison and exonerated.Inthe future, rebels who challenged army units must be treated lenientlythrough“education”and“criticism.”Attacks on military units nolongerjustified arrests, and no actions were to be taken against rebels for opposingthemilitary.Itwasnow absolutelyforbiddentouse armedforceagainstmass organizations. The new orders were accompanied by arrests of armyofficers in regions where some of the worst suppression campaigns had beencarried out.2 These punishments signaled to the military officers that failureto adhereto theneworders could haveseverepersonal consequences.The new orders tied the hands of PLA units and undermined the au-thority of local PAD commanders. Rebels who had initially opposed them,and who had been the objects of suppression, were able to reassert theiropposition andmobilize to contest the initial actions of army officers andthe local PAD. Certain senior officials in Beijing encouraged resistance tothe army. In a meeting with rebels from Shandong Province near the end ofApril,oneleader asserted that local PADcommanders“are nothing morethan local cadres who wear a military uniform."13 Local PAD officers werelater prohibited from mobilizing rural militias to stabilize their control, en-suring that the impact of these directives would reach into rural counties.14Theimpact of this reversalis clearly reflectedinlocal annals.Figure 6.3traces the reported actions of rebels and military or government authori-ties from January 1967 to December 1968. The dashed line traces actionsby military or government authorities to repress rebel activity. The spike inrepression in February and March of 1967 refects the initial interventionof the armedforces and the arrests thatfollowed in someregions.Theim-pact of the new April orders was immediate.

Insurgentactivity-----ActionsofauthoritiesFigure 6.3. Monthly Counts, Insurgent Activity and Acts of Repression by Authorities,1967-1968disappeared almost entirely until the end of the year. The solid line tracesthe number of reported actions by rebel groups—their attacks on civilianor military compounds, or violent clashes between rebel factions. The trendlineis almosttheinverse ofthatforrepression—rebelmobilization accel-erated rapidly after April 1967 and reached its height the following summerbefore subsiding, but rebel activity persisted at high levels into mid-1968,before finally ebbing in response to elevated levels of repression.The upsurge in rebel activity does not indicate a simple story of politicalopportunity. It also represents the mobilization of rebel factions that sup-ported military forces and fought to defend military control in a contextwhere the armed forces were forbidden from directly intervening——this iswhat factional clashes were about. The curtailment of repression representednot merely an opportunity for anti-army rebels to mobilize—-it compelledpro-army rebels to defend their sponsors and themselves.RedrawingtheLinesofConflictThe army's new orders undercut their ability to enforce their decisions,and in some cases even to defend themselves. They were forced to release134AGENTSOFDISORDERfromprisonrebelstheyhadpreviously arrested andtopermit themtore-build their banned organizations, although in some regions they delayeddoing so,further stoking rebel animosity.After their release, these rebelleaders pulled together increasingly coherent rebel organizations, whichadopted an intensified hostility to the armed forces. There was,however,an additional consequence.Rebelswhohad cooperatedwith the armedforces and who felt that the army's intervention favored their side in localdisputes,also became the targets of rebel factions now making a comeback.New factional identities were forged and reinforced as resurgent rebelfactions denounced the army's actions and their rebel supporters. Denun-ciationofmilitaryunits andtheircommanderswasintendedtode-legitimizerival rebel groups.If the army's actions were politically reactionary, thenthe rebel groups who cooperated with and benefited from the army's pre-vious moves could be portrayed as“conservative” collaborators with armyunits opposed to the Cultural Revolution. These charges left their oppo-nentswithlittlechoicebuttominimizethe army'serrors anddefendtheirearlieractions.Indefending the army,they drewon thefactthatLinBiao,thecommanderof China's armedforces,hadrisentothenation'ssecond-highest position at the outset of the Cultural Revolution as Mao's“closestcomrade-in-arms”and designated successor.This stanceimpliedthat theprevious charges against their rivals were justifiedthose who opposed thePeople's Liberation Army in their mission to“support theleft”had com-mitted grave political errors. The anti-army rebels, on the other hand, por-trayed themselves as the only genuine rebel force. The comeback by thesuppressed rebels sharpened and intensified earlier divisions over power sei-zures, driving one wing of the rebel movement into a closer and mutuallysupportive relationship with the armed forces, and the other wing into in-tensified hostility to both the military and their rebel rivals.The rhetoric generated by this confrontation made it appear that theanti-army rebels were more radical than their rivals.Their position was notradical in the sense that they sought more thoroughgoing change in thestatus quo ante.Instead,it was radical only in the sense that they refusedtoacceptthelegitimacyofthe army's actions andopposed there-impositionof political order on the army's terms. Resurgent anti-army rebels con-sciouslycultivatedtheideathattheyweresuppressedpreciselybecausethey were the only genuine revolutionary force. In their view, the supportiverelationship that rival rebels developed with the military showed that theyTHEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE

135lacked revolutionary spirit, and were aligning themselves with forces in-imical to the Cultural Revolution. This impression was reinforced in themonths to come asresurgent rebel factionspressed their campaigns againstthe army, actions that made them a disruptive force. Early analyses of thesefactional divisions adopted thelabels“conservative”and“radical”to de-scribe these splits, and saw them as expressing inherent political orienta-tions of the leaders and members of the two wings of the rebel movement.15These analyses suggested that there were orientations inherent in the twogroups that were fixed beforehand. But these political orientations were theproduct of theinteractions that split rebels inearly1967,not their cause.The contingent and interactive construction of factional orientations isalso evident in the shifting reaction of radical figures in the Central Cul-tural Revolution Group to the developing splits among provincial rebels.As we have seen, power seizures in Guangzhou and Nanjing were carriedout by one wing of the local rebel movement, while excluding a number oflarge and prominent rebel groups. In both places the rebels who were leftout loudly denounced the power seizures as “fake." Beijing radicals initiallysupported the cause of these excluded rebels, in large part because they sus-pected that the power seizures were part of an expedient effort simply torestoreorder.Atthatpointintimetheexcludedrebelscouldbeviewed as"radical." In supporting their opposition to the power seizures, radical fig-ures inBeijing hoped to keep the spirit of rebellion alive and ensure thatpowerseizuresweregenuine.As pro-power seizure rebels in these two provinces became antagonisticto army units that imposed military control without certifying their powerseizure, and as rebels opposed to the power seizures became more supportiveof the armed forces, the Beijing radicals shifted their support from one rebelfactionto another.Theirinitial concernhadbeenthatregionalpower sei-zures had to be broadly representative of rebel forces. By April, however,their primary concern was to push back against the army. The anti-armyrebels, who had earlier carried out power seizures in Guangzhou and Nan-jing initially denounced as“fake,”now became their preferred rebel force,because they now clashed with army units. In this context, they now ap-peared to be the “radical” force. In subsequent months, the Beijing radi-cals developed supportive relationships with anti-army rebels and steeredtheir activities through liaison personnel that were stationed in the provin-cial capitals. In other words, even in the perception of Beijing politicians136AGENTSOFDISORDERwho tried to steer the direction of the rebel insurgencies, the definition of“radical"” and “conservative” was malleable and entirely context-dependent.16TheFormationofRegionalAlliancesTo this point I have described local political processes that laid the foun-dationsforfactionalantagonisms.Thisimplicitlytreatedlocaljurisdic-tions as developing factions in parallel, relatively independently of eventsin nearby regions, as a product of contingent and intensely local sequencesofevents.Thefactionalwarfare thatfollowed,however,increasinglyin-volved coordinated action among like-minded factions across the bound-aries ofcounties andcities.Aslocalclashes escalated,factions soughtalliesand reinforcement outside local political boundaries. By 1968, as we willsee,thelargest andmostviolentfinalbattleswerebetweenregionallydefinedfactionsthatdrewuponfighters across entireprefectures.On what basis did cross-regional alliances form? How did local rebelschoose allies in another jurisdiction? Factions frequently aligned with oneanother based on their occupation of equivalent positions vis-a-vis localmilitaryauthorities.Solong astherewas aunifiedmilitarycommandstruc-turein amilitarydistrict or subdistrict,localrebels sought out allies whoshared the same orientation toward themilitary.Factional alignments within military districts were driven by the needfor allies outside one's own city or county. When factions crystallized inthe provincial capital that were defined by attitudes toward the provincialpower seizure and the army's actions, rebels in equivalent positions at lowerlevels pledged allegiance accordingly. In Guangdong Province, for example,when the rebels who were suppressed by the military rebounded in ApriandMay,theyformed a new alliance thatwashostiletothe army's actions;it eventually became known as Red Flag. Their opponents, who had origi-nally objected to their exclusion from the January power seizure and whodenounced it as“fake”(because it left the entire provincialleadershipinplace), came to be known as East Wind. They favored military controlbecause it refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the power seizure. EastWind therefore defended the army's earlier actions, and in so doing de-fended their own claims to legitimacy as a genuine rebel force.17After these factions crystallized in the provincial capital, they were soonreplicated at lower levels. Rebel groups in cities and counties aligned them-

THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE137selves with structurally equivalent groups at higher levels. In prefectures,cities, and counties across Guangdong, rebel groups whose claims had beenfavored by the army's intervention—and who as a consequence were fa-vorableto the army's local role,alignedthemselves withEastWind.Rebelgroups who dissented from local settlements imposed by the armed forcesaligned themselves with Red Flag.It did not matter which rebel factionhad benefited most from the army's decisions. It did not matter whetherthe faction favored by the local armed forces had seized power or had ob-jected tothepower seizure.It didnot matterwhether thosewhoseizedpower were cadre rebels or whether the cadre rebels had objected to a morebroad-basedpowerseizure.Whatmatteredwaswhowassatisfiedwiththelocalpoliticalsettlement asdeterminedbymilitaryunits.Ifyouweresat-isfied, which meant that you were not opposed to the army's actions sinceJanuary,youalignedyourselfpoliticallywithEastWind.Todootherwisewould undercut your own position. If you were dissatisfied with the resultsofmilitarycontrol andobjectedtothearmy'slocalrole,youalignedyourself withRed Flag and appealed to similarly identified factionsfor support.These province-wide political alliances were based on the structurally equiv-alent positions of actors across levels of government. The political afflia-tionswererootedinfactionaldivisionsthathadstructuralparallelsacrossjurisdictions.One example among many that could be cited is Haifeng County,located on the Guangdong coastline midway between Hong Kong andShantou.RebelcadresdeclaredapowerseizureinthecountyinlateJanuary 1967, and with the support of the People's Armed Department theyproceeded to consolidate their control in the name of a rebel alliance knownas the“Left Committee”(zuo wei). Rebels left out of these arrangementsformeda separate allianceknown as the“People's Headquarters"(renzong),and a violent rivalry followed.At the end of March regular PLA troopsmoved into the county and established a Military Control Committee anda production command headquarters dominated by theLeft Committee.In April, after some preliminary clashes with People's Headquarters rebels,they declared the alliance a counterrevolutionary organization and arrestedits leaders. After the April shift of the army's general orders the People'sHeadquarters made a comeback and began to reassert itself. In responsetheLeft Committeemobilizedmilitiaforces,obtained automaticrifles andmachine guns, and staged two massacres of their poorly armed opponents138AGENTS OF DISORDERin late August and early September. The two assaults left 91 dead and morethan 3,0o0 wounded. The massacre alarmed officials in Beijing and theGuangzhouMilitaryRegion,andthelocalMilitaryControl Committeewas dissolved. The PLA troops stationed in Haifeng were blamed for theincident, and they were transferred out and replaced by a new unit.18After the massacres, many activists in the Left Committee alliance quitand joined the People's Headquarters, which soon changed its name to RedFlag to identify with provincial factions that opposed military controlforces.Theremainingleaders of theLeftCommitteemaintained controlover the production command headquarters,but they changed their nameto East Wind, reaffirming their alignment with provincial military author-ities. The two sides identified themselves with province-wide factions byadopting the names of the corresponding factions in the provincial capitalofGuangzhou.19This pattern was replicated in many provinces, and identification of al-lies by lower-level actors was made easier by the colloquial labels given tothe province-level factions. In most of Jiangsu province and especially inthe region surrounding its capital of Nanjing, the pro-power seizure (andanti-army)factional alliance was known colloquially as the“good faction’(hao pai)——the power seizure was“good." The anti-power seizure (and pro-army) faction was known as the “crap” or “stinks faction" (pi pai)—thepower seizure “stinks."20 Rebel factions in neighboring Anhui Provinceadopted thesamenicknames.21In Guangxi, the crystallization of factional alliances is particularly welldocumented. The province's First Party Secretary, Wei Guoqing,was alsothe political commissar of the Guangxi Military District. He had been tar-geted by rebels as Guangxi's“number one capitalist roader”and as themastermind behind Guangxi's“bourgeois reactionary line.”He was kid-napped and held hostage for a period in January and was subjected to vio-lent struggle sessions. The rebel alliance that seized power in Nanning inJanuary 1967 saw his overthrow as one of their major accomplishments,but like rebels elsewhere they soon splitintofactions over representationin the provincial power seizure committee. Given the deepening divisionsbetween rebel factions and their inability to unite, Guangxi was put undenmilitary control in March.22Military control placed Wei Guoqing in charge of Guangxi's armedforces as political commissar of the Guangxi Military District.23 Many

THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE139rebels in the provincial capital vehemently opposed the decision to leavehim in charge, and organized mass rallies to call for his overthrow. Otherrebels in the capital accepted Beijing's decision, and supported Wei. Thedecision split the rebel alliances in Nanning. Under Wei's direction pro-duction command posts were formed in cities and counties.These tempo-rary organs of power were a first step toward establishing a permanent revo-lutionary committee. As military control was enforced across Guangxi,certain wings of local rebel movements were incorporated into them, andothers were opposed. The splits among local rebels derived from their orig-inal stances regarding the local power seizure and their reaction to thearmy'slocaldecisions.Opposition to military control under Wei Guoqing in the provincialcapital coalesced into the “April 22" faction (named after large and dra-maticprotests inNanning on that date), after which a delegation travelledto Beijing to plead the local rebels case.Shortly afterward, the April 22faction expressed their support for Wu Jinnan, the third-ranking officialin Guangxi's party leadership. In line with the new April orders to mili-tary units, Wu had criticized Wei Guoqing for the continuing suppressionof rebels opposed to military control. Across the province, local factionstook opposite sides for or against Wei and Wu based on their support oropposition to local military control.24 Rebels who had cooperated withPLA or PAD forces adopted the name Allied Command, while those op-posed to local settlements took the name April 22. By June these identitieshad spread across the province, leading to province-wide factional con-flict between rebel groups pledging allegiance to rival party leaders inGuangxi.By July 1967 these factional identities had spread across the province.Factional conflict had developed in 95 percent of Guangxi's eighty-six citiesand counties. Rebels opposed to local military control had adopted thename“April 22" in 77 percent of these localities, while rebels that supportedmilitarycontrolhad adoptedthename“AlliedCommand”in85percentof them. By the end of 1967, these labels had been adopted by opposed factions in almost every city and county in the province.25 At the local level,thisoftenleftthePADcommander astheheadof theAlliedCommandfaction.It would be a daunting task to try to identify one of these factionsas more favorable to the status quo than another——-each pledged allegiancetoadifferentprovincialleader.140AGENTS OF DISORDERThese alignments grew rapidly, for reasons that are easy to specify. Rebelgroups locked in violent rivalries needed outside allies. The support was mu-tual: factions in cities and prefecture capitals could call upon allied fac-tions in nearby counties, and factions in rural counties,in turn, could calonhelpfrom allies in nearby cities or counties.There was a structural foun-dationfor thesefactions,but the relevant structures were not the staticones defined by the relative positions of individuals and groups in prionstructures of power and privilege. Party and government cadres, the pil-lars of the status quo ante, had rebelled against their own superiors and inmanycases organizedpowerseizures.Cadrerebelswerethemselvesdividedinto opposed factions. Rebel students and workers,who had united in thelate-1966movementstooverthrowincumbentpartyandgovernment au-thorities,alsodividedintofactions accordingto theirpositionsvis-a-vis therecent power seizures. The antagonisms that resulted led, after the inter-vention of armed forces, to new structures of power, in which some rebelfactions had the support of military units while others'claims went unrec-ognized. Factions formed in local jurisdictions, and eventually across localjurisdictionswithinprovinces,basedonthelocation ofgroups instruc-turally equivalent positions in these evolving structures ofpower and con-flict. The ability of opposed rebel factions to identify with one another alongthese lines, and to form alliances with rebels across jurisdictions, boostedthe organizational capacity of both sidesin their growing confrontations.TheUpsurgeofCollectiveViolenceTherebelsliberated by thenew restraints placed on the armedforcesproceeded to build more coherent organizations to press their grievances.In many cases serious charges had been lodged against them that wouldhave serious repercussions if their opponents prevailed and the army re-mained to preside over a local revolutionary committee.As rebelsmountedcampaignsto undermine the armedforces andforce theremoval ortransferof local army commanders, antagonisms deepened.

Deaths- ---- InjuriesFigure 6.5. Casualties Due to Insurgent Events, by Month, December 1966-October 1967rapidly, as the impact of the army's new April orders was felt.The upwardtrend accelerates in July and into August, when there were more than onethousand reported insurgent conflicts, the highest monthly count duringthis entire period of upheaval.The striking overall rise in collective violence is apparent in Figure 6.5which traces monthly totals of casualties reported in connection with theevents tracked in Figure 6.4. Aggregate numbers suggest that the factionalbattles became larger and more violent, as factions obtained weapons andformed specialized brigades of fighters.These trends are clear in compari-sons of the first quarter of 1967 (January-March) with the third quarter(July-September). In the first quarter of 1967,there were a total of 337 vio-lent events; during the third quarter, there were 2,065, a 6-fold increase.Casualty counts, however, grew much faster. During the first quarter of1967,1,084 injuries were reported;during the third quarter,there were23,606,a 22-fold increase.The number ofreporteddeaths increased at aneven faster rate. During the first quarter of 1967 there were a total of 113reported deaths; during the third quarter, there were 4,210, a 37-foldincrease.

THE EMERGENCE OF FACTIONALWARFARE143Although levels ofviolence were rising,overall casualty rates remainedmodest. In thefirst quarter of 1967 there were 3 reported injuries per vio-lent event, and only 1 death for every three events.By the third quarter,there were 11 reported injuries and 2 deaths per event. These are large in-creases,but stillmodest casualty counts.Until lateJuly,streetfighters relied primarily on clubs, spears, and rocks thrown or propelled by slingshotsEven at theheight of the collective violenceinAugust1967,whenfirearmsand heavy weaponry first spread among combatants, the number of casu-alties remained relatively low. These were not trained and committedfighters and they did not yet appear willing to risk life and limb duringconfrontations.The events referredtoinlocalannals as armedbattles(wudou)duringthesummerof1967werenotyetthelarger andmoredan-gerous affairs described by that term in 1968.A more comprehensive and perhaps representative view is provided bysummary data compiled for individual regions. The annals for the Hebeiprovincial capital of Shijiazhuang stated that there were 132violent clashesbetween rebel factions in the city from May to July 1967—around 3 clashesevery2days.Theygenerated areportedtotalof10deaths,536seriousin-juries, and 1,918 minor wounds—an average of 1 death for every 14 events,and 4.1 serious injuries per event.26 Summary figures of this kind capturethe large numbers of small clashes between rebel factions that often wentunmentionedinlocal annals,whichtendedtoreportonlythelargest andmost dramaticclashes.They remindus thatwhileviolent clashes werein-creasinglycommon,large-scalecombatwasstillrare.Explaining theSummerUpsurgeDespite these caveats, it is clear that there was an upsurge in violent con-fict in August 1967 and a sudden drop shortly afterwards. How can weexplain this? Once again, signals emanating from Beijing shaped the paceand direction of local insurgencies. The April reversal in the army's ordersstrengthened the hand of rebel factions antagonistic to military control.They rebuilt their forces in May and June and mobilized to challenge rivalrebels who had developed a more supportive relationship with the armedforces. As these antagonisms and related violent clashes gradually increased,a sudden and dramatic shift emanating from Beijing intensified the violence.Central propaganda organs suddenly called for rebels to “drag out a144AGENTS OFDISORDERhandful of capitalist roaders in the army"—openly sanctioning direct at-tacks on army units. This was coupled with a directive originating withMao himself in mid-July that calledfor arms tobe distributed to genuinerebel factions.27 This was a dramatic signal to anti-army rebels, and for thefirst time it gave factions on both sides access to arms with which to wagetheirbattles.The frustration of radical figures in Beijing with the actions of thearmedforceshadpersisted sincetheAprilshiftinthe army'sorders.Manyregional commandersinitiallydelayed therelease ofarrestedrebels,andthe reversal of verdicts on their organizations.After finally complyingwith their new orders, they were perceived—justifiably——to favor the rebelfactionsthatwerefavorablyinclinedtothem.28Thisfrustrationcameto ahead after dramaticeventsinWuhannear theend ofJuly that were con-demned as an attempted rebellion by regional military forces——the“July 20Incident.The Wuhan events followed from a series of unusually aggressive actionsby regional military forces. Initially, events under military control in Wuhanfollowed the pattern in other regions—rebel forces who claimed tohaveseized power resisted military control and were suppressed, while rival rebelsapplauded the army's actions.Shortly afterwards,however,frictions devel-oped between the military command and the other rebel faction,and thearmy suppressed the other wing of the rebel movement as well. Both wingsof the divided rebel movement began a comeback after the reversal of thearmy's ordersinApril,andinresponselocalmilitarycommandersspon-sored a new mass organization that strongly supported the military forces.Known as the “Million Heroes" (baiwan yingxiong), the membership andorganizational foundations of this resurgent group resembled the ScarletGuardorganizationsthathadearlierdefendedparty authorities.TheMil-lion Heroes grew rapidly and waged a violent campaign against the now-unitedrebels,andhadthemonthevergeof totaldefeatinearlyJulyAlarmed by these developments,Mao sent theMinister of PublicSecurityalongwith a radical member of theCentral Cultural Revolution Group(WangLi)to negotiate an end to the hostilities,save the rebelforces fromextinction, and force the Million Heroes to stand down.Mao secretly ar-rived at a state guest compound to monitor the negotiations and sanctionthe anticipated cease-fire agreement.29

THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE145Events there took anunexpected turn when leaders of theMillionHe-roesrefused tobelievethatMao's emissariesrepresentedhisactualviews.Angered by their apparenthostility to their organization,militants fromthe group, along with soldiers from supportive military units, stormed theguest compound where theywere staying and took the two emissariesfromBeijing hostage. They did not realize that Mao Zedong was staying in anearby villa.Fearful for Mao's safety and unsure of the intentions of thelocal military commanders, Mao's security detail rushed him to board aAight toShanghai in themiddleof the night.30Beijingimmediatelydenounced theeventsofJuly20as a"counterrevo-lutionary rebellion"and an attempted military coup. Wang Li, the captiveemissary from the Central Cultural Revolution Group, who was beaten incaptivity and suffered a broken leg, was fown back to Beijing to a hero'swelcome that was publicized nationwide.The Million Heroes was con-demned as a reactionary organization and quickly collapsed. Wuhan'sarmy commanders were summoned to Beijing, stripped of their posts, andphysically abused in denunciation meetings.31 Beijing radicals called forrebelstodefendthemselveswitharmedforce.Maoorderedthedistributionofarmsto“leftist”rebelforces.32RedFlagmagazine,theauthoritativemouthpiece of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, published an edi-torial on August 1 that called for the “dragging out" of“capitalist roaders"in the army.33 Anti-army rebels mounted major offensives against localcommanders.They obtained arms for their offensive, as did rebels friendlyto the local military.34 The August upsurge of violence was the result.RegionalViolenceDescriptions of the rebel clashes that generated the largest reported deathtolls during this period provide a concrete sense of these events at their mostviolent.Some ofthemost dramaticfactionalwarfarewasinSichuanProv-ince, where the February campaign of suppression against rebels who op-posed the power seizure was particularly broad and harsh.After their re-lease, these rebels reconstituted their forces and engaged factional rivals inarmed clashes across the province. The casualty rates were inflated by sei-zuresofmilitary-gradeweaponryfromthearmamentsfactoriesconcentrated in the province. One of the first major battles was in Chengdu, the146AGENTS OF DISORDERprovincialcapital,where,onMay6,more than10,000rebelsfrom thetwofactions faced off at a large factory that produced military weaponry. Theclash that day left 48 dead and 629 wounded.35Elsewhere in Sichuan, in and around the large city of Chongqing, amajorYangzi River port and manufacturing center, thefirst battle in whicheach side used firearms took place at a diesel engine factory on July 8,leading to9 deaths and the capture of more than 200.Military weaponrysoon appeared in other clashes. Near the end of July each faction staged aseries of raids on local armaments factories, seizing stores of weapons andammunition in preparation for further clashes.A series of battles in nearbyRongchang County in the first week of August involved more than 600fighters armed with machine guns, rifes, and hand grenades, leaving 78dead. On August 3, rebels attacked a military launch in the Yangzi Riverwith an antiaircraft gun, sinking it and killing 3 soldiers who were on board.Two days later,rebels deployed tanks,antiaircraft guns,and machine gunsin a battle at a local machine tool factory, leaving 22 dead.The continuing battles in the city would cut off shipping down theYangzi River toWuhan and Shanghaifor almost 40 days.Rebels raideddisabled ships and seized large shipments of consumer goods, medicine,cigarettes, and pork. Combatants from one of the city's shipyards outfitted3 makeshift gunboats and attacked a number of factories and docks alongthe harbor on August 8,killing 24, injuring 129, and sinking 3 boats anddamaging 12 others. On August 12 and 13, more than 500 rebel fightersengaged one another at a local machine-building plant, deploying a varietyof military armaments and tanks, killing 10.

OnAugust 28,a clash near a military installation in Chongqing involving morethan 3,000 rebels left 40 dead. Fighting in one neighborhood engaged morethan 1,000 fighters in a battle that left more than 100 dead.During the August warfare in Chongqing, 157 of the 165 large indus.trial enterprises in the city were at least partially shut down, and 109 of

THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE147them were completely closed. The documented death toll from these battleswas close to 60o. Alarmed that weaponry intended for the war effort inVietnam was being seized for factional battles, Beijing issued an order onSeptember 5 for regular army units to disarm the rebels, and the fightingin Chongqing quickly subsided.36InXiangtan,Hunan,similarlyviolent confrontations occurred,thoughon a smaller scale. Xiangtan was a county-level city 32 miles upriver fromthe provincial capital of Changsha, and 15 miles downriver from theprefecture-level city of Zhuzhou. The factional battles in Xiangtan drewon allies from both cities,who often arrived by boat.On July10 and 11,some1,ooorebelsfromtwofactionsfacedoffinfightingthatspreadfroma local boiler plant to the Xiangtan Hotel, leaving 3 dead and several hun-dred wounded. On August 11 and 13 local factions staged raids on localmilitary arms depots,takingwith them arms and ammunition.On Au-gust 12 one of the local factions rolled tanks into position at the main porton the Xiang River to deter reinforcements from Changsha by their op-ponent's allies. Several days later, a demonstration march by several thou-sand rebels through the streets of Xiangtan was blocked by their opponentsleading to a clash that left 2 dead and 12 wounded. After this, fighting in-tensified,leadingtothe closure of the city's steelplant andseveral mines,and rebels raided several military installations to seize arms. The fightingwas temporarily quelled after regular army units were dispatched to citiesin Hunan in mid-September. During this period the factional warfare inXiangtan, waged on occasion with tanks, armored personnel carriers, andheavy artillery, generated 92 deaths and several hundred wounded.37In Changzhou, a prefecture-level city in southern Jiangsu, midway be-tweenNanjing andShanghai,thefirstmajor armedclashesbegan onJuly 25 and lasted two days.

The rail line connecting Nanjing and Shanghai was cut for 11days,postal service,telephone and telegraph service wereinterrupted fontwo weeks, and public transportation was shut down for 10 days.38In Zaozhuang, a prefecture-level city in Shandong, the most violent in-cident during this period occurred at the local four mill on July 26.Rebelsfrom one ofthemill'stwofactionscaptured8rebelsfrom theotherside and torturedone of them todeath.Inretaliation,their comradesmo-bilized militia forces from nearby collective farms, and more than 4,000farmers,armedwithrifes,marchedinto the cityand surrounded themill,touching off a battle that left 96 dead and 692 wounded.39In Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, several hundred fighters from oneofthelocalfactionsinvadedthearmsdepotofalocalmilitaryacademyand seized more than 300 rifes.When cadets from the school, who wereallied with the opposing faction, discovered the theft in progress, theyopened fire, and in the ensuing battle 21 were killed and 76 seriouslywounded.According to the account, these were the largest casualties fromany armed battle in Jinzhou during the entire period.40High death tolls could also be generated in more remote rural counties,although sustained battles of the kind observed in Chongqing and othercitieswererare.Thelargestrecordeddeath tollfor a countyfroma singlebattle during this period occurred in Gan County, around a bend in theGanshui River from the county-level city of Ganzhou in Jiangxi Province.For several days beginning on June 29, armed rebels from Ganzhou andGanCounty assembled thereforabattlethatleft178deadandcutoffrivershipping.

THEEMERGENCE OFFACTIONALWARFARE149Rebel confrontations with army units were less frequent and less per-ilous during this period. Rebel actions against army units and their com-manding officers grew only modestly until July, and spiked in August. Thesewere primarily mass demonstrations outside army compounds, or invasionsof army compounds with the objective of seizing military officers, raidingarmsstockpiles,or both.This would seemtobe aparticularlydangerousaction,especiallygiventheharshmeasuresemployedbymany armyunitsagainst hostile rebels in February and March.But the army's April ordersbanned the use of armed force against the rebels, and throughout this pe-riod they appear largely to have abided by these restrictions. Of the 798rebel actions against army units reported from April to October, there wasan average of one death for every four events, and one injury per event.Fewer than 7 percent of the rebel confrontations with the armed forcesduring these seven months reported any deaths or injuries. When casual-ties were reported, they averaged 4 deaths and 17injuries,well below thecomparable estimates for armed factionalbattles. Clashes with army unitswould become much more dangerous in1968,when soldiers were onceagain given the authority to use force, but during the high point of 1967the toll from rebel confrontations with army units was still relatively low.Invasionsofmilitaryheadquarters andarmsdepotsduringAugustwererarely resisted with armed force. A typical example is from HanshouCounty, Hunan, where a rebel faction opposed to military control raidedthe headquarters of the People's Armed Department on August 25 andseized rifles and ammunition without incurring any casualties. Subsequentgunfights between factions in the county over the next two weeks gener-ated 19 deaths and more than 30 wounded before the army was ordered todisarm civilian factions in early September.5 After Beijing ordered thatarmsberecoveredfromlocalfactionsonSeptember5,local army unitsputup more spirited resistance to raids on arms depots. The deadliest recordedconfrontation between a civilian faction and local armed forces during thisperiod was in Laibin County, Guangxi,onSeptember 6——the day after thearmy's new orders. More than 200 rebels from Liuzhou City staged a raidon suburbanLaibin County'sPeople's Armed Department to seize arms.In the ensuing confict 17 were killed, 2 of them soldiers.46 In WanxianCity, Sichuan, the largest single death toll from a civilian confrontation withmilitary or security forces during this period did not come about due tothe use of arms.During aJune 3invasion of thecity'spublic security150AGENTS OFDISORDERbureau, at that time under military control, hundreds of rebels rushedinto the building, causing many to be crushed and trampled underfoot.Dozens were sent to local hospitals, and 31 of them eventually died.47TowardtheRebuildingofPoliticalOrderThe upsurge of collective violence in the summer of 1967 was short-lived.Violent insurgent conficts and related casualties dropped sharply afterthe August peak. The decline in collective violence had the same originsas the previous upsurge—a decisive shift in signals emanating from BeijingThe change in political direction became apparent through several differentchannels. It began in mid-August, when Mao became concerned about thenationwide upsurge of rebel attacks on local army units and made it knownto his aides that calls to“drag out" army commanders was a mistake.48 Soonthereafterhe personallyreassured besieged commanders ofmilitaryregionsthat he fully supported them, and would not permit them to be overthrown.49Near the end of August Mao concluded that several of the younger radicalmembers of the Central Cultural Revolution Group had “wrecked theCultural Revolution”" by encouraging attacks on the army. Within days theywere charged with being secret agents and were placed under arrest alongwith several members of their staff. The purged traitors included Wang Li,the official who had been kidnapped by the Million Heroes in Wuhan andwho had returned with a broken leg to a hero'swelcome inBeijing in lateJuly.50This quickly reversed the signals being sent to regional rebels by seniorfigures in Beijing. Zhou Enlai, who met constantly with delegations ofrebels from various provinces, stated in no uncertain terms that attacks onlocal military commanders would nolonger be tolerated.More senior mem-bers of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, mindful of the purge oftheir younger colleagues, withdrew their backstage support for attacks onmilitary commanders.51 The shift in direction was made public and off-cial by a September 5 directive that called on all factions to support thearmed forces, emphasizing that they represented Chairman Mao. It de-nounced the seizure of military weaponry by rebel factions, and it alsoprohibited military units from distributing arms to their supporters. Localarmy units were ordered to retrieve weapons from rebels, who were orderedto turn in their weapons.If necessary, soldiers were given permission to

THE EMERGENCE OF FACTIONALWARFARE151defend themselveswitharmedforce.52Thenew orderswererapidly disseminated through the military hierarchy. In some regions, the orders wereread out over the telephone at the countylevel on the very same day thattheordersweretransmitted.53This reversal, which was signaled through a variety of channels, deci-sivelyinfuenced thelocal insurgencies.By October thenumber ofinsur-gent events and the number of casualties had dropped to the levels observedin June, prior to the summer upsurge (See Figure 6.4). Factional divisionswere still deeply entrenched, and violent clashes continued, but for the timebeing on a reduced scale.Mao decided that it was time to resume the long-stalled effort to establish revolutionary committees in the many provincesthat had been placed under military control. Zhou Enlai was put in chargeof the effort, and he immediately began to negotiate ceasefire agreementsbetween deeply divided regional factions, and push for political settlementsthat would permit the formation of revolutionary committees. This wouldturn out to be a laborious and increasingly coercive process, carried outprovincebyprovince.Delegations ofrepresentativesfromrivalrebelfac-tions and localmilitary units were summoned toBeijing and isolated forintensive negotiations.54 There were still 22provinces that remained undermilitary control,anditwouldtake anotheryearbefore all ofthemhadrevolutionary committees. The greatest upsurge of collective violence, how-ever,wasyettocome.7THEDYNAMICSOFREGIONALESCALATION

THE REIMposITIoN OF order in theform of revolutionary com-mittees spread gradually, province by province,beginning in late 1967, andcontinued throughout 1968. Mao himself set the process in motion inSeptember1967,whenhe complained about the slowprogress ofimposingprovincial revolutionary committees, and called for the establishment of10 new ones byFebruary 1968.1As this effort spread,factional violenceescalated evenfurther, and it was concentrated in regions where militarycontrol had endured for long periods of time.Rebel factions in theseregions appear to have fallen into an escalation trap. The longer that vio-lent factional warfare raged on in a region, the more likely that the loserscould expect severe retribution at the hands of their factional enemies.This fear was especially salient for factions that had fought long and hardagainst military control.This process drove the escalation of factionalwarfare during 1968, even as the number of regions with active insurgenciesdeclined.As the push to rebuild political order resumed, the pattern of rebel ac-tivity shifted in striking ways. As Beijing imposed political settlementsbacked by military units in one region after another during 1968, the overalllevel of insurgent activity declined steadily. Figure 7.1 traces the monthlycount of all7,976reported events thatindicated rebel activity during1967and1968.2There is a sharp decline after the summer of1967, and an even-tual collapse after May-June 1968.

As insurgent ac-tivity declined, violence intensified. The reported number of injuries anddeaths was much higher in 1968. During the three-month peak in mid-1968, there were almost twice as many reported deaths as in the prior threemonth peak in mid-1967 (8,049 versus 4,630).3Increasing repression by the armed forces does not account for risingcasualtiesfromfactional warfare.Theimpact ofrepression,as we shall see,was very large. The events examined here are actions by rebel insurgents,the vast majority of which are direct clashes between rebel factions. Fac-tional violence intensified over time, and appears to have escalated as theend of rebelinsurgencies approached.How can we explain this pattern?Todo so we need to reverse the cus-tomary emphasis of theories about political mobilization. These theoriesfocus on the problem of how movements are initiated and sustained—how154AGENTS OFDISORDER000s00000000000

JanMarchMayJulySeptNovJanMarchMayJulySeptNovFigure 7.2. Monthly Count of Deaths Due to Insurgent Events,1967-1968they get underway, how they grow, and the factors that infuence their rela-tive success. This depends on the organizational capacity of groups, theinaccess to resources and how effectively they deploy them,opportunitiespro-vided by the political environment, and the effectiveness of tactics andstrategy. In other words, this familiar approach is essentially about how col-lective action emerges, and how it is sustained.4In the present case the key to understanding the escalating intensity ofviolence is to be found in examining exit from collective action, or how itends.The nature of these conflicts,and the structure of this political set-ting,meant that failing to prevail in factional warfare did not simply meana failure to win certain advantages. Much more importantly, there werepotentially severe costs to be borne by defeated rebel factions. The longerand more violent the conficts, the more severe were the likely costs of losing.In one sense, of course, rising casualties from a smaller number of insur-gent conflicts surely refected the increasing scale and organizational co-herence of rebel factions, and their growing access to military weaponry.But an increased fighting capacity does not explain why rebel factions be-camesointenselymotivatedtoprevailthattheywouldbewillingtobear

THEDYNAMICSOFREGIONALESCALATION155the much heavier casualties in the larger and more dangerous battles of1968.Thelonger that local factional warfare continued without the pros-pect of an equitable political settlement, the greater the stakes for the par-ticipants and the more intense the collective violence as factions fought toavoid theconsequencesoflosing.Before pursuing this line of analysis, one needs to be clear about theultimateobjective ofrebelswhotookdifferentsides overtheissue ofmili-tary control. Once factions formed, why did anti-army rebels fight to presstheir claims, and why were their rebel opponents so adamant in defendingthe armed forces?For rebels opposed to military control, there was no pros-pect of an equitable settlement so long as the same military commandersremained inplace toestablishlocal revolutionary committees.This was es-pecially true where struggles against military control had been long andviolent. Narrative accounts indicate that anti-army rebels wanted localcommanders to be reprimanded or removed. Continued resistance was asignaltohigher authorities thatlocalcommandershadfailedintheirmis-sion. The longer resistance continued, the greater the prospect that militarycommanders might be removed and replaced by ones with a more equitablestancetowardlocalfactions.New army units transferred in from elsewhere might be more neutralin local conflicts, or even switch support from one faction to another. Thisdid happen on occasion during the course of prolonged conflicts.In someregions,military units in nearbyjurisdictions,or units from differentbranches of the military, were supportive of factions that were antagonisticto local military control.5 In one particularly dramatic case, rebels whoseresistance to military control had been supported by a regional People's Lib-erationArmy(PLA)unitpleadedwiththatunit's commander todisobeytransfer orders out of theprovince.As these rebelsfeared,theremoval ofthis armyunit ledquicklyto aharsh crackdown that crushed theirresis-tance.6 The prospect of harsh retribution spurred rebels opposed to localcommanders to harden their resistance, which compelled pro-army rebeltodefendtheirlocalsponsors.There was an inherent zero-sum quality to the situation,making com-promise more difficult. If new army commanders, or entirely new militaryunits, were transferred in as replacements, rebels that had supported mili-tary control feared losing theirbacking or,even worse,the new commandersmight side with their rivals. This zero-sum quality was further accentuated156AGENTS OF DISORDERby the features of this single-party dictatorship and planned economy—there was literally no exit from the locality. Rebel activists could not migrateto other regions of China to escape punishment at the hands of their fac-tionalenemies.Theywould remainin thesame communities andevenin thesame workplaces. Household registration and the rationing system for staplefoods and consumer goods tied individuals to their local communities,makingitimpossibletoleave.Jobassignmentswereconsideredpermanent,and switching to new workplaces (or schools) was virtually impossible.The absence of an exit option from local settings ensured that defeatedfactions would return to their original places of work, under the control oftheir enemies. If one faction prevailed with military backing, the loserscould anticipate a broad and enduring array of persecution.Asidefromsummary execution orprolonged imprisonment,one's opponents wouldnow control a range of distributional questions, in particular the alloca-tion of jobs and career opportunities. Because life chances in a plannedeconomy werebased on administrative decisions,the distributional outcomes of political conflict were particularly salient and the impact longlasting. Once violent factional warfare was entrenched, factions had strongmotives to prevail, pushing at least for stalemate. The longer and more vio-lentthefactionalconficts,themorelikelythatlosingwouldbringsevereand prolonged retribution. In this setting, factional warfare, once prolongedbeyond a certain point, became something of a trap. The combatants werecompelled to fight to the bitter end,fearful of the potentially severe conse-quencesofdefeat.ThePolitical Geography of EscalationEvidence for this explanation can be found in the political geographyof escalation—where and when factional violence persisted for long periods,where it escalatedover time,andwhereit didnot.Therewasbroadvaria-tion across China's provinces in how long factional conflict was sustained,andhowitended.Table7.1lists thedatesofprovincialpowerseizures(column a), the date that military control was imposed (column b), and thedate that the province's revolutionary committee was formed (column c).The jurisdictions are ranked according to the length of time between thedate of theprovincial power seizure and the eventual formation of therevolutionarycommittee(listedincolumn d).Provinces that didnot ex-THEDYNAMICSOFREGIONALESCALATION

As elsewhere, local army units sought to impose order and adju-dicate disputes in anticipation of a local revolutionary committee, but theydid so in the name of a Mao-approved provincial government. The pacifi-cationoffactionalconflictintheprovincialcapitalmeantthattherewaslittle effective resistance to the new authorities, and no potential allies fordisgruntled local rebels. This facilitated the ability to forge compromise andcreate revolutionary committees in the cities and counties below.

Exit from collective action imposed relativelyfew costs, even though the gains of inclusion in local revolutionary com-mittees were foregone. In these settings, compromise or surrender was morelikely than obdurate resistance. Half of the cities and counties in these prov-inces already had their own revolutionary committees by May1967.Beijing halted the approval of provincial power seizures after March 1967,and imposed one by fiat in the nation's capital in April.

This is where the escalatingviolenceof1968wasconcentrated.As new revolutionary committees were established in rapid order during1968, they took on an ominous character for factions opposed to militarycontrol. The provincial revolutionary committees established in early 1967were headed by a civilian who had expressed sympathy for rebel movements.This second wave of revolutionary committees,by contrast,essentially formalizedmilitarycontrol.Militarycommanderswhohadbeen attackedbyanti-army rebels for many months generally remained to head the new rev-olutionary committees.Of the remaining 23provincial-level revolu-tionary committees,20were PLA generals.8The core of the new revolu-tionary committeewas almost always the officer previously placed in chargeof military control. In Jiangsu Province, by 1970 the top official in almosteverycity and countywas amilitary officer—all13prefectures,and 60out of 68 counties.?In Guangdong, Liaoning, Shanxi, Yunnan, and Hubei,between 81 and 98 percent of all revolutionary committees above thecounty level were headed by PLA officers.10 Some new revolutionary com-mittees sought to achieve a balance by including representatives of bothmajor factions; others stronglyfavored one faction at the expense of theother. Rebel leaders rarely occupied positions of genuine authority. Thosewhohadstubbornlyresistedtheformationofarmy-ledrevolutionarycommittees were typically pushed aside, and in some cases arrested, and re-placed by more cooperative leaders from the same faction.12 Deposed localoffcials who had been cast aside during power seizures were in a similarposition—their placement in new structures of power as“revolutionarycadres”did not confer real power.13The prospect that the same military officers who had long been stationedin your locality would remain as heads of a new government intensifiedtheurgency ofprevailinginlocal conficts.Rebelfactions alignedwithlocalcommandersfought to ensure that they were not removed and replaced,THE DYNAMICS OFREGIONALESCALATION

The approach of a final settlement compelled local rebels to fighthard to avoid the severe consequences of losing.If we define local political settlements as a county or city where both alocal and a provincial revolutionary committee has been established, wecan chart their spread. For present purposes, we are interested in localitiesthat were without a political settlement for the longest period of time.Figure 7.6 traces the decline in the number of these localities during 1967and 1968. We see a slow decline throughout 1967, with a very rapid decline during 1968. It is in this rapidly diminishing number of localitieswithout apoliticalsettlementthatthemostviolentfactionalwarfareshouldhave occurred,with thehighestlevels of escalation occurring in thelocali-tieswherewarfarepersisted thelongest.Figure 7.7 examines the number of deaths per insurgent event in thelocalities without a political settlement that are displayed in Figure 7.6.Itshows a sharp and steady rise in the death rate over time,with the highestobserved levels occurring in October 1968—when there remained onlyaround 100 localities without a settlement. There were roughly 3 deaths

Deaths per Insurgent Event, by Month, in Localities without a PoliticalSettlement,1967-1968per event in the peak of rebel violence in the summer of 1967, but a rapidand steady increase during 1968, finally reaching close to 10 deaths perevent onthe eve ofthelocalrebel movement's extinction.Although these descriptivepatterns seemclear,a more convincing testof the argument requires a statistical model. The model would examinevariation in the intensity of factional violence (number of deaths per month)across localities and over time.The descriptive data indicate that violenceescalated primarily in provinces placed under military control, and that itintensified over time as the duration of unresolved conficts increased.Totest this idea, the model will divide provinces into two groups—those withearly revolutionary committees, and those placed under military control.Within each of these two broad regions, the model would then examinedifferences in theintensity of violence according to thelength of time thatelapsedbeforethelocalityhad apoliticalsettlement.Toexamine theidea that violenceintensified over timeinregionswithouta political settlement,foreachlocalitywecalculate the durationinmonthsbetween the first local intervention by military units and the month whenboth a provincial and local revolutionary committee were established (thisTHE DYNAMICS OF REGIONAL ESCALATION

165corresponds to the definitions employed inFigures 7.6 and 7.7).The lo-calities are divided into three groups of equal size, based on their time du-ration prior to a final political settlement: short,medium, and long.Eachof the three groups are then examined separately for provinces that hadearly revolutionary committees and provinces that instead were placedunder military control.This results in 6 different periods across the twotypes of provinces,with theperiods before military intervention and aftera politicalsettlement asbaselineperiods.Once these categories are defined, a regression model estimates differ-ences across these periods of varied duration for evidence that longer dura-tions exhibitedhigher deathrates (deaths per month).14 The regressions con-trol for both local population (larger populations would likely generate largerinsurgencies andmore deathsper month)aswell asthe contrastbetweencitiesand counties (urban areas were able to mobilize larger numbers).Because our outcome ofinterest is a count of deaths per month, the ap-propriate model is negative binomial estimation. In addition, because thereis surely selectivity in whether a local account reports numbers of fatali-ties, the appropriate statistical model is a two-stage zero-inflated model.In the zero-inflated model, the cases where the dependent variable is zero(a month with no reported deaths) are modeled separately from non-zeroes.A first-stage equation predicts the likelihood that a locality will report nodeaths for a given month. The second-stage equation estimates coefficientsthat are re-weighted and adjusted for the results of the first-stage model. Inthe first-stage model is a variable “length” that is the count of the number ofChinese characters that a local history devotes to the description of events.The reasoning is that longer descriptive accounts will be morelikely to re-portdetails,inparticular thenumberofcasualtiesforeachofthereportedfactional clashes.Lengthis essentially anindicator oftheresourcesdevotedto compilinglocalhistories,and alsoofeditorialdecisions abouthowmuchdetail to provide. Adjusting estimates for the length of accounts reducesthe potential biases that may result from differences in the propensity oflocal accounts toreport details.15The results of this procedure are summarized in Figure 7.8,which re-ports differences in death rates across provinces and local durations of dif-ferent length.16 For readers unfamiliar with margin plots, the black dot isthepointestimateforthepredicteddeathratein acertainperiodoftimeand the brackets of equal length that are attached to each side of the point

Of greatest relevance are the estimatesfor the longer durations in these provinces. This is where we should see thehighest death rates as a symptom of escalation traps. The estimated deathrates for both the medium and long duration groups (an average of 12.0and 16.1 months, respectively) are 4 times larger than in localities withshort durations, and more than 8 times larger than the estimates for theshort and medium duration localities in the other group of provinces. Thesedifferences are statistically significant from all others by a wide margin. Thefinal estimate presented at the bottom of the figure, for the period aftertheformationofalocal andprovincialrevolutionarycommittee,indicatesrelatively low intensity of violence,equal to thelevels observed in the shortand medium duration localities in provinces with early revolutionarycommittees.17These results provide further evidence for escalation traps in localitieswith long histories of conflict under military control. An early political set-tlement at the province level suppressed factional violence overall, while inprovinces placed under military control for long periods, violence escalatedover time,resulting in higher death rates in localities with longer periodswithout apolitical settlement.Thelonger thatconflict continued,themoreseveretheperceivedcosts oflosing,andtheharder thatfactionspushed tomobilize combatants toprevail.18Is there evidence that the costs of losing were more severe for groupsthat were defeated in these regions? Tanigawa found such evidence fromhis examination of county-level revolutionary committees in one particu-larly violent province where political settlements were long delayed. In80 percent of the counties in Shaanxi where rebels were able to avoid de-feat until after new army units were transferred into the province in lateJuly 1968, both rebel factions were represented on local revolutionary com-mittees. In every one of the revolutionary committees formed before that168AGENTS OFDISORDERdate, only one faction had representatives,indicating the defeat of the otherfaction.More than twice as many deaths were generated in subsequent po-litical campaigns to consolidate political order in the counties where onefaction had decisively lost.More direct evidence of the dire consequencesofdefeatwas the fate of the“April22”faction in Guangxi,whichfoughtone of the hardest last-ditch defenses in the country into the summer of1968.After theirfinaldefeat at thehands of armyunits alliedwiththeirfactional rivals, a wave of reprisal killings generated massive death tolls, inwhich members of April 22 comprised the overwhelming majority.20 Thiswas the anticipated outcome that drove escalation traps.FinalFactionalBattlesTo this point I have analyzed patterns of conflict in the abstract withoutdescribing the dramatic events that the patterns represent.Drawing on ac-counts of events during this period in the more detailed local annals, Iwillconveyadescriptivesenseofwhatthisfinalwaveofintenselyviolentfactional warfare looked like on the ground.InShaanxiProvince,whichhadsome ofthelargest andmostpersistentfactional warfare, combat escalated in the months leading up to the estab-lishment of the provincial revolutionary committee in early May 1968. InZiyang County, a cease-fire agreement between the two local factions brokedowninMarch,andinAprileachsideseized armsfromthePeople'sArmedDepartment and the local police. One of the factions, drawing on allies innearby counties, armed themselves and formed fighting brigades thatroamed across the county's smaller towns, fighting a series of pitched battleswith their opponents that generated around 10 deaths in each encounter.As the fighters moved around the county they captured and tortured indi-viduals aligned with the opposed faction and unaffiliated civilians, killingmorethan40o.21InYan'an,theformer capitalofMao'swartimebase area,110 died in fighting between rebel factions from May to July, including 30who died in a single battle in nearby Fu County on June 3.22 In MianCounty, ten armed battles between April 5 and July 18 left 65 dead.23In Sichuan province, the Beijing negotiations to form a provincial revo-lutionarycommitteebeganinMarch1968.Asthesenegotiationsproceeded, armed battles intensified in and around the large prefecture-levelcity of Chongqing.

Near the end of the month,firemenon their way to extinguish a blaze set during an armed battle were firedupon by workers from a steel mill; 9 of them were killed and 17 wounded.24In Zhongjiang County, a distant suburb of the provincial capital ofChengdu,rebel fighters from 20 counties and 3 cities across Sichuanstreamed in to take part in battles that began in mid-April. In fighting overthe next3weeks thetwo sides,armedwith antiaircraftguns and similarheavy weapons, suffered a total of 314 combat deaths. After the fightingwas over, one faction marched 3,0o0 captives back to Zhongjiang and summarilyexecuted78ofthem;morethanathousandrefugeesfedtoChongqing and other cities to avoid the fighting.25 In remote GuangyuanCounty, located on Sichuan's border with Shaanxi, one faction capturedthe county seat on July 1 and in the ensuing battle to retake the town 190people died.2° In Yuechi County, 100 miles north of Chongqing, 2,000fightersfacedoffinabattleonApril 23 thatleft53dead andmorethan100wounded.27TheSichuanProvinceRevolutionary Committeewas establishedon thelast day of May, but the province had experienced armed battles betweenwell-armed factions formuch of the past year.Some of the largest and mostviolent conflicts were still to come, as factions fought a last-ditch effort toavoiddefeat inlocalrivalries.Luzhou,a county-level city on theYangziRiver 120 miles upstream from Chongqing, experienced one of the largestbattles ever recorded. Luzhou had been the site of two large clashes duringthe summer of 1967, but the casualties appear to have been limited. Thefinal battle between two large and heavily armed forces took place in July.More than 30,0o0 fighters from the surrounding region took part in thebattles, employing firearms and gunboats in Luzhou and nearby counties,and coordinating their operations by radio. They killed close to 1,0o0 inbattle,andcaptured aroundtenthousandprisoners,ofwhommore than900 were summarily executed. Large parts of the city and its port lay inruins.At a chemical plant 21 boats were destroyed. By the time the fightingended,over 2,000 had been killed in Luzhou and an estimated 24,000 werewounded. Luzhou's revolutionary committee was not established untilNovember 1968.28 Violence persisted elsewhere in this prefecture, whichproved particularly difficult to pacify. In Hejiang County, across the Yangzi170AGENTS OFDISORDERRiverfromLuzhou,askirmishbetweentwofactionsinlateSeptemberleft11 dead, and in the ensuing battle another 140 were killed. Hejiang didnot establish its revolutionary committee until January 1969.29SomeoftheworstrecordedviolenceduringthisperiodoccurredinGuangxi Province, where violent factional battles that preceded the estab-lishmentoftheprovincialrevolutionarycommitteeneartheendofAugustfrequently spurred the victorious combatants to engage in bouts of indis-criminate mass killings. A cease-fire between the two factions—AlliedCommand and April 22—had been reached through negotiations in Bei-jing near the end of 1967. The agreement broke down in March 1968 ascounties and cities began to establish local revolutionary committees.Justover half of Guangxi's cities and counties had formed revolutionary com-mittees in March, and close to 90 percent had done soby the end of April,but this appeared only to intensify the last-ditch armed resistance of theApril 22 faction, which had stubbornly resisted military control. So longas a revolutionary committee was lacking at the province level, determinedand even desperate resistance persisted at the local level.In Guilin, a revolutionary committee was established for both the cityand prefecture in mid-April, putting the Allied Command faction in con-trol.Butonly5ofthe12countiesintheprefecturehadestablishedsimilarrevolutionary committees by the end of May, and fighters from the April 22faction were not yet willing to give up.

Duringthis short period 869 people were put to death in towns and villages inXing'an. More than 8,500 noncombatants died in similar killing spreesduring these weeks across Guilin prefecture.31Sporadic fighting continued across China even after September 1968,largely in remote regions and on a much smaller scale. There were 3,926factional battles recorded in the annals for 1967 and 1968,but only 372afterwards, all but 7 of which occurred during 1969. The majority of theseconflicts (210) occurred in four remote regions—Guizhou, Sichuan, Tibetand Xinjiang. Only 46 of them reported at least 10 deaths, and only 72 atleast 10 injuries.Only two incidents generated casualties on the scale ob-served during thefinal battles around theformation of revolutionary com-mittees in 1968. In Yinjiang County, Guizhou, which contained a largepopulation of Tujia and Miao minorities, factional fighting in June 1969left 139 dead and 21 severely wounded. The fighting caused more than2,0oolocalresidentstofee the county totakerefugeinneighboring Sichuan province.32 Similar battles in Xichang County, a Tibetan region infar western Sichuan, left more than 600 dead and wounded from MarchtoJuly1969.33Theyear1970markedthe endof this era ofviolent warfare.Of the 4clashes recorded in the annals for that year, 2 were in Xinjiang, and oneeach in Sichuan and Zhejiang.The last recorded factional battle,leaving 5deadinAugust1970,occurred in a county that spanned achain ofislandspopulated by fishermen off the coast of Zhejiang. That county also was thelast known jurisdiction to establish a revolutionary committeein No-vember 1971.34 These conflicts represented the last glowing embers of theconflagrations thatraged acrossChinafor almosttwoyears.8REPRESSIONUNLEASHED

WE HAVE JUST EXAMINED the violence generated by clashesbetweenrebel factions.NowIwill turn to the impact of therepression ex-ercised by military and civilian authorities as they imposed revolutionarycommittees.The final push to establish revolutionary committees relaxedremaining constraints on the use of militaryforce.I will consider separatelytwo distinct types of repression. The first is coercion deployed against armedrebel factions in order to create conditions for establishing a revolutionarycommittee, or to defend a revolutionary committee immediately after itsestablishment. The second is repression that was applied after the rebel fac-tions were disarmed and disbanded—organized campaigns designed toconsolidate political order in workplaces and communities. The first typeof repression placed at risk active combatants in rebel insurgencies, and tosome extent those connected to them by political or kinship ties. The secondtype, however, placed the entire adult population at risk, and resulted infar more casualties and political victims than anything previously observedduring this entire period.As we shall see, the cure for factional warfare wasfarworsethan the disease.TheRepressionofRebelForcesRepression increased sharply during 1968.

There are vastly more reported victims than casualties.A total of 336,662 victims and 46,140 casualties are represented in Fig-ures 8.2 and 8.3.Repression associated with the formation of revolutionary committeestook two different forms. First, it represented the victimization of rebel fac-tions who lost local struggles, the anticipated outcome that drove the esca-lation traps of 1968. Second, it represented a final armed offensive againstlocal rebels who staged last-ditch resistance against the imposition of orderby army units. The data do not permit the disaggregation of the two, butthere is ample evidence for both in narrative accounts.FromFactionalWarfaretoMassRepressionNarrative descriptions in published annals provide a vivid sense of thekinds of activities that generated these numbers.In Guangdong Province,close to 90 percent of cities and counties had established revolutionary com-mittees by the end of April 1968, yet stubborn factional resistance per-sisted across the province. In July, the provincial revolutionary committee176AGENTS OFDISORDERissued stern directives calling for its final suppression. Chenghai CountyhadestablisheditsrevolutionarycommitteeinApril,but armedopposi-tion persisted in a number of villages. After a clash in one village left 22dead in late July, local militia and regular army troops surrounded 8 holdoutvillages the following week, beating to death 69 and arresting more than80. The prisoners were taken back to the county seat, where another 17 ofthemwerebeatentodeath atthefrontgatesofthepublicsecuritybureau.In Changjiang County, similarly harsh measures were taken to consolidateitsrevolutionary committee,whichwasestablishedinApril.Continuedre-sistance was declared tobe counterrevolution by the new county authori-ties, and militia forces were unleashed on the holdouts. During a one-monthperiod that began near the end of July,more than 3,oo0 were arrested, morethan 1,000 resisters were wounded, and 122 were killed.2 In WenchangCounty,which alsoestablishedits revolutionary committeeinApril,awaveof arrests in July targeted rebel leaders and spread to individuals in politi-cally suspect households.More than 200 were killed or committed suicidein a final wave of repression against active political opposition.3In Huangmei County, Hubei, a revolutionary committee was formedin January 1968,and the new authorities conducted a large suppressioncampaign against the rebel faction that had fought against its establish-ment until the very end. From May until December, the campaign targetedclose to 6,700 individuals for alleged counterrevolutionary activities. A totalof1,804were arrested,subjectedtoharshinterrogation andvariousformsof physical torture.In the course of the campaign,749 of these individualswere injured, 90 suffered permanent disabilities, and 129 were beaten todeath in captivity.4 These are precisely the kind of feared outcomes thatdrove the escalation traps observed in some regions—defeated factionsfearedviolentretribution.Frustrated by their inability to quell the disorders on China’'s border withVietnam duringtheheight of theU.S.escalationofthewar,MaoissuedanorderinearlyJuly1968thatmadeabsolutelyclearthatcontinuedresis-tance in Guangxi by armed factions would no longer be tolerated. Troopsunder the Guangxi Military District, supporting the Allied Command fac-tion, moved into position in mid-July to direct the final campaign. A revo-lutionary committee had been established over the provincial capital ofNanningbackin mid-April,anticipating a subsequent revolutionary com-mittee for the province as a whole. Stubborn and well-armed fighters fromREPRESSION UNLEASHED

177the April 22 faction, however, still occupied several key buildings andneighborhoodsinthecapitalandrefusedtosurrender.Thefinalbattletocrush them destroyed large parts of downtown Nanning, and generatedcasualties on a scale comparable to those observed the previous month inthe Sichuan river port of Luzhou.The final battle began on July 15, when troops from the Guangxi Mili-taryDistrict andrebelsfromtheAllied Commandsurrounded andsealedoff the downtown city blocks still occupied by April 22 forces. At noonthe next day they began shelling the district, and the bombardment con-tinued until nightfall.As the bombardment resumed the following day,squads of soldiers and Allied Command fighters tightened their cordonaroundtheApril22districts,andthetwosidesbegantothrowfirebombsat one another, setting fire to commercial and residential buildings in thearea.The main headquarters of April 22,in the city's largest departmentstore, caught fire after being hit by mortar fire. Artillery bombardment con-centrated on April 22 outposts along the nearbyYongjiang River port,setting alight thousands of barrels of gasoline and aviation fuel, guttingscores of river freighters along with their contents. On July 27, militaryunits,unableto dislodge the defenders,broughtmore sophisticated weaponsto bear, and began to use anti-aircraft weapons, recoilless cannons, surface-to-surface missiles, and tanks to pound the city blocks and buildingswhere April 22 fighters were concentrated.The indiscriminate bombard-ment set fire to residences and office buildings and reduced 33 city blocksto rubble. The April 22 fighters continued to resist with rifes and fire bombsuntil August 5,when the lastholdouts alongLiberationRoad surrendered.During the battle of Nanning, according to “incomplete statistics,"1,340 April 22 fighters were killed and 6,445 were taken prisoner, alongwith 2,500 residents suspected of supporting the rebels.As soldiers and Al-lied Command fighters marched hundreds of captives out of the rubble-strewn neighborhoods along Liberation Road that morning,26 of themwere summarily executed. During the entire campaign to pacify Nanninga total of1,587 combatants died (84 percent of whom were April 22 fighters)and 9,845 combatants and other suspects were taken prisoner.More than7,000 of the April 22 prisoners were sent back to their home counties,wheremorethan2,300weresoonexecuted.As the fighting in Nanning reached its apex, repeated broadcasts of theJulydirectivecallingforthecrushingofcounterrevolutionaryresistance178AGENTS OFDISORDERset off a wave of mass killings across Guangxi. The victims included localrebels who were aligned with the April 22 faction, but the killings frequentlyspread to their family members and other people in stigmatized politicalcategories. The worst reported death toll was in Binyang County, wheremass killings took place in every one of its rural communes. During an11-day period from July 26 to August 6,3,681 individuals were put todeath, at times in the most gruesome fashion. The killings were not limitedto April 22 sympathizers or to adults in households stigmatized as formerlandlords and other kinds of class enemies. The massacres also includedchildren andtheelderly,and176householdswereentirelyexterminated.This eruption of violence accounted for 93 percent of the total deaths re-corded in Binyang Countya pattern repeated across Guangxi.6 This ex-traordinaryspasmofviolencefinallyclearedthewayfortheimpositionofGuangxi's revolutionary committee onAugust 26.Guangxi's was the27th provincial revolutionary committee to be established. Only tworemained—Xinjiang and Tibet, both of which followed 10 days later, onSeptember5.SystematicRepressiononaNationalScaleThe final suppression of factional conflict, after almost two years of en-demic collective violence, might lead one to expect a rapid decline in thenumber of deaths, injuries, and in levels of political persecution. Revolu-tionary committees were establishedin many regions only after a finalspasm of intense violence.Yet local annals describe a new wave of repres-sion, conducted by revolutionary committees in the form of a campaignknown in most localities as the“Cleansingof the ClassRanks”(qingli jiejiduiwu).Table8.1illustrates the magnitude of the repression unleashed underrevolutionary committees. It sorts into two groups the total number of re-ported deaths, injuries, and victims generated by the political conflicts ofthe period—or to be more precise, the subset of the reports that can betied to specific events. In the first group are all reported deaths, injuries,and victims generated by political events from June 1966 until the monthprior to the formation of a revolutionary committee in a city or a county(the median date was April 1968). In the second group are the same totalsfor the period beginning with the month that a local revolutionary com-REPRESSION UNLEASHED

The category of“victim” is more loosely defined.It includes anyone formally accused of a political crime, whether impris.onedornot; anyonewhowas firedfrom theirjobs,expelledfromtheinhomes in the city and relocated to the countryside for political reasons (in-cluding family members expelled along with them); and anyone subjectedtoaviolentstrugglesession oraharshinterrogation.Two things stand out in Table 8.2. The first is that the actions of au-thorities generated far more reported deaths and victims than the actionsof insurgents——-by several orders of magnitude. The second is that the po-litical campaign known as the “Cleansing of the Class Ranks"was by farthe single most important generator of casualties and victims.

Two other campaigns, known as the “OneStrike,Three Anti”and the investigation of“May 16 Elements,”typicallybegan during 1970 and 1971, respectively, and fall after the period cov-ered in this book. The two latter campaigns were much less violent but gen-erated more than 2 million reported victims. These three campaigns, car-riedoutin an organizedfashionbyestablishedrevolutionarycommittees,generated a reported total of 7.6 million victims, well over half of the totalnumber ofreportedvictimsfrom all causes.Why were actions of authorities so much more damaging than thevio-lent insurgencies that persisted across China for almost two years?And inparticular, why did these late campaigns generate so many more reportedcasualtiesthantheviolentfactionalwarfareoftheearlierperiod?Onepos-sible interpretation is that there are simply more complete records for or-ganized political campaigns than for the chaotic events in the prior period.It is likely that reports of casualties generated by factional clashes are lessREPRESSION UNLEASHED

181complete. But even if we could adjust for differences in reporting, large differenceswouldlikelyremain.The answer is more likely to lie in the process of restoring political au-thority attheleveloflocal communities andworkplaces.Theestablishmentof a revolutionary committee over a city or county was only the first stepin rebuilding political order.It generally marked the effective suppressionof factional alliances that spanned across counties and cities, deeply crip-pling if not eliminating their ability to coordinate political action. This,however,onlyservedtopushfactional antagonismsbackintoindividualoffices, factories, schools, and villages. The animosities and rivalries sur-vived, but they were now bottled up in smaller settings. The heads of pro-vincialrevolutionary committees continued tocomplain about a plague ofgrass-roots factionalism in factories, offices, and local communities for ayear or more after revolutionary committees were established.7Political au-thoritystillhadtobereestablishedatlowerlevelsofsocialorganizationafter a prolonged period when all manner of military and civilian authorityhad been openly defied. This was an intense period of state building at thegrass roots.The reimposition of these highly intrusive and partially militarized state structures involved theintensive application of repression acrossallgrass-rootssocial organizations.While these campaigns targeted individuals with a history of challengingauthority orwho continued to defy the new order andpursue factional ani-mosities, the Cleansing of the Class Ranks was explicitly designed to at-tack a much broader slice of the population. The campaign originated atthe national level with an editorial in People's Daily on New Year's Day,1968,which called for the cleansing from society of a variety of class ene-mies and traitors.A May 1968 report of how the campaign was conductedin a factory in Beijing served as a model for emulation throughout thecountry. The factory's military control committee, staffed by officers froman elite military unit, carried out a campaign that focused on older per-sonnel who had worked in the factory under the Japanese occupation andthe Nationalists. Mass meetings exposed alleged traitors and unmaskedhidden counterrevolutionaries. The suspects were subjected to struggle ses-sions, forced to write confessions, and warned that leniency would be ex-tendedonlytothosewhoconfessedfully.8The Cleansing Campaign reached more localities than the 1967 waveof rebel power seizures, and it was conducted even in regions that never182AGENTSOFDISORDERreported insurgent activity or factional battles. The annals from 89 percentof all localities reported activity related to the Cleansing Campaign,com-paredto81percentthatreported apowerseizure,76percentthatreportedinsurgentactivity,and66percentthatreportedviolentfactionalbattles.April to October 1968 was the high tide of the campaign's spread—the me-dian date was August. Fewer than 6 percent of reports occur prior to themonth that a local revolutionary committee was formed, and more thanhalfof allreports arewithinthefirst5months afteritsestablishment.The campaign was organized in local government offices, factories,schools, and collective farms by“case groups"” (zhuan'an zu) that were ex-pected to bring charges against suspects. Political dossiers were scoured forevidence of suspicious behavior or past associations.As it unfolded acrossthe country the case groups began with suspicions, moved to accusations,and then interrogated suspects with the aim of securing a confession.Thequestioning was typically harsh and threatening. Despite instructions fromBeijing that only “principled” methods be employed, coercive interroga-tions andphysical abuse were common.According to subsequentreports,sadistic tortures were applied by some of the more zealous case group in-terrogators.Manysuspectsdiedunderinterrogationor committedsuicide.One of the reasons why the number of victims of this campaign was sohigh is that an admission to counterrevolutionary activity implied that onehad co-conspirators. Those who named names under coercion, hoping toendtheirordeal,servedonlytodragothersuspectsintothecampaign'smachinery.Suicidewasconsidered an admission ofguilt andwas decried as abarrier to extracting the names of additional co-conspirators. Those judgedguilty of particularly serious offenses were executed.9But deaths due to executions, excessively brutal interrogations, and sui-cide were a tiny percentage of the numbers investigated and charged duringthe course of this campaign. In Shanghai, where it ran from January 1968through April 1969,169,000 individuals were placed under investigation,and the official death toll among these suspects (5,0oo, based on “partial"statistics)suggeststhatthedeathrate amongthoseaccusedwasroughly3 percent.1o These numbers fit broadly with the death rate implied by thecasualty numbers for the Cleansing campaign in Table 8.2. Of the 5.6 mil-lion individuals who were reported in local annals to have been victimizednationwide during the campaign, 96 thousand reportedly died—1.7 percent. Despite the low apparent death rates among victims, the widescope of the campaign and the unpredictability about who might be ac-REPRESSION UNLEASHED

183cusedwaslikelymorethanenoughtodeter anydisgruntledrebelswhostillhad thoughts of challenging authority. It seems likely that this was in factthecampaign's intent.If the death rates during the campaign were so low, how did the overalldeath toll become so large, outstripping by a factor of 3 the total reporteddeath toll due to all insurgent activities in the prior period? And how didthe total number of victims become so large——more than 10 times the totalnumberofreportedvictimsoftherebelmovement andrelatedfactionalism(areported5.6millionversus527,000)?The overall numbers might suggest that the Cleansing Campaign wasconducted with a ferocity that far outstripped that of the violent periodthatprecededit.But thereis a less dramatic andmoreplausible explanation.Unlikethefactionalwarfareof1967and1968,almost every adult inChina was potentially at risk in the Cleansing Campaign. Only a fractionof the population joined a rebel faction, and even fewer were armed com-batants.The majority of adults were uninvolved in the dramatic conflictsof the recent past. Combat between rival mass factions took place primarilyoutside ofworkplaces,across city districts,in nearby rural counties,or thestreets of county towns.Moreover, while large factional battles werecommon in 1967 and 1968, they were brief events, and still relatively rare.Therewere4,411violentfactionalclashesmentionedatsomepointintimeacross 2,246 cities and counties.But only 66 percent of these cities andcountiesreported at least oneviolentclash.Evenwithin thecities andcoun-ties that reported factional warfare, only small percentages of the adultpopulation,primarily young males,would have participated actively in thecombat brigades organized by rebel factions.Direct evidence about the percentage of citizens who were involved infactional combat is very rare, but a local history for one county in GuizhouProvince provides a detailed breakdown. The account states that at theheight of factional warfare in late 1967, the two local factions were evenlymatched, with 3,318 “hardcore rebels" (zaofan gugan) in one faction and3,682 in the other. These two groups together represented roughly11 percent of the total adult population of the county.fl There were surelyotherswhowere associatedwithfactionswhodidnotparticipatein combatbrigades, but they would not have been exposed to combat risks.By contrast, the Cleansing Campaign was carried out in hundreds ofthousands of grass-roots organizations—schools,urban workplaces, andcollective farms——each of which was expected to find and punish political184AGENTSOFDISORDERdeviants. Unlike brief events connected with rebel insurgencies, the cam-paign was systematically applied over a sustained period. As people returnedto their places of work, they were all exposed to the campaign, whether or notthey had been involved in factional activities. The campaign's startling scopeand the surprisingly large counts of casualties and victims are the conse-quence of this shift in organizational settings. One could escape from fac-tional warfare simply by not participating, but very few adults who workedoutside the home could escape exposure to the Cleansing CampaignThis also helps us to understand how a certain kind of state capacitywas restored so quickly after a near-complete collapse of civilian govern-ments. The deeply militarized structure of the Chinese party-state, whichpredated this period, explains how order could be restored so quicklythrough a well-organized application of repression, once Beijing's supportfor the application of armed force was unambiguous.In reality, the core ofthe new government in the vast majority of localities was the party organ-ization within the armedforces,whichwas stilllargelyintact.“Partycoregroups”were established during this period,dominated by military offcersand including selected civilian party officials—many of them previously"cadrerebels"—whosurvived thetumult andwere offered positions on rev-olutionary committees.Cooperative leaders of favored mass factions thatmanaged to survive the Cleansing Campaign were also included in thesenew leadership structures, though in practice they had little real authority.RebellionversusRepressionoverTimeThe surprisingly high levels of repression so evident in this later periodraise abroader question about the overallpattern of rebellion andrepres-sion from the beginning of these upheavals in mid-1966 to their end.

Authorities-----InsurgentsFigure 8.5.Reported Deaths due to Actions of Insurgents versus Actions ofAuthorities,Relativeto theFormationof Local RevolutionaryCommitteestolls due to repression by authorities did not surpass the insurgent deathcounts until three months prior and continued to increase in the monthsleading up to the restoration of local governments. They accelerated tounprecedented levels afterwards, despite the continuing decline of insur-gentactivity.13Death tolls indicate the violence associated with rebellion and repres-sion, but they are not an accurate refection of overall levels of political per-secution. Many more people were made to suffer in ways that did not in-volve deadly violence. The difference in the numbers victimized byinsurgents versus authorities is much larger even than the gap for deathtolls. More than 4 times as many people were reportedly killed by the au-thorities than by insurgents,but the authorities reportedly created morethan 18 times as many victims as insurgents (calculated from numbers inTable 8.2).The reasons are the same——the victims of authorities were gen-erated by political campaigns that were carried out in an organized fashionthroughout the country in basic-level social organizations, exposing liter-ally the entire population to a militarized new state structure.REPRESSION UNLEASHED

187The early Red Guard and rebel movements engaged in fierce persecu-tions in their initial months.

But the numberofstudents andrebelactivistswasrelativelysmall,andtheirpersecutionsweresporadic andunorganized.Thereisnonethelesssomejustificationfonthe reputation of the Red Guard and rebel movements as particularly vio-lent. There was one death for every 15 individuals reportedly persecutedby insurgents, while there was one death for every 70 people victimized bythe authorities (calculated from figures in Table 8.2). Based on the infor-mation provided in local annals, it would appear that one's prospects fonsurvival were much higher if one was targeted for persecution by authori-tiesrather thaninsurgents.ABroaderViewBy any comparative standard, the first three years of China's CulturalRevolution deserve to be ranked among the largest political upheavals inmodernhistory.Theaccountsinlocalannals describeremarkablelevels ofpolitical mobilization and collective violence. While these claims are plau-sible, they lack precision.How does China's upheaval of 1966-1969 com-pare with other major instances of domestic political conflict or state-directed repression? This question has both quantitative and qualitativedimensions.The quantitative dimension is obscured by the partial nature of the ac-countsrecordedinlocalannals.Only afraction of the events thatoccurredin Chinese localities during these years were recorded in the annals. Ofthe events that were reported,only a fraction provided specific numbers ofdeaths, injured, or other victims. The potential scale of such underreportingis evident when one compares the numbers tabulated from city and countyannals with totals occasionally provided for provinces as a wholebothpublished accounts and unpublished government reports.The two prov-inces that reported the highest numbers of deaths, refecting considerablestatistical detail in the annals, are Guangdong and Guangxi. The local an-nals in our database from Guangdong reported a total of 31,012 deathsrelated to the political events of the period. Summary figures for Guang-dong published in China, however, report a total of 42,227 “abnormal"deaths during the same period.14 Even larger gaps in reporting are evident188AGENTSOFDISORDERwhen one compares published accounts with the classified internal inves-tigation reports from Guangxi. The published annals from Guangxi re-ported a total of 55,651 deaths—by far the highest number for any prov-ince. The compilers of these accounts were able to provide such statisticaldetaildue tothe availability of unpublishedinvestigationreportsfor everycityandcountyintheprovincethatrecordedamuchhighertotal82,868.15 Even in this instance, where the compilers of local annals hadaccess to exhaustive and authoritative investigation reports, they chose topublish only two-thirds of theinternal numbers.The underreporting in the city and county annals for other provincescould be much more extreme.The annals for the urban districts and ruralcounties of Beijing reported a total of 5,807deaths,while a published ac-count for the city provided a figure of 10,275.16 The Jiangsu local annalsreported a total of 3,877 deaths, while a published provincial history re-ported more than 30,000.17 In Shanxi, the same gap was 3,753 versus anumber just under 20,00o.18 These examples suggest that at their most com-plete,local annals reported two thirds of the actual number of deaths(Guangxi), but others report well below 20 percent (Jiangsu and Shanxi)This assumes generously that published provincial fgures are not them-selvesundercounts.Editorialpoliciesofprovinceshadamajorinfuenceonthedetailpro-vided in local annals. Journals devoted to the compilation of local annalsconducted a spirited debate during the 1980s about how much detail toprovide about the conflicts of this period.1 Many provinces clearly choseto provide markedly less detail than others. The average number of reporteddeaths by provinces was in excess of 8,500, but the median was only 3,877,a highly skewed level of statistical detail. The average figure for provincesbelow themedian is only1,941.Despite obvious and widespread underreporting, there were still 275,052total deaths reported in the 2,246 city and county annals in our database.This clearly is only a fraction of the total number of deaths generated bythe events described in this book,andby other events notrecordedin localannals—but how small a fraction? In a separate publication, I have exam-ined in considerable detail the differences between summary provincial figures and tabulations from city and county annals, and between publishedand unpublished accounts.Ialsoemployed sample selectionmodelsto pre-dict the likely underlying numbers at the city and county level. This effortREPRESSION UNLEASHED

189generated a deliberately conservative range of estimates that ranfrom alower limit of 1.1 million to an upper limit of 1.6 million deaths. This wouldimplythatthecityandcountyannalsreportedanywherefrom17to25 percent of the underlying death count.20Afterpublishing these estimates,Iencountered an articlepublished ina Hong Kong magazine that was purportedly based on two classified in-vestigationscommissionedbytheCentralCommitteeoftheChineseCom-munist Party. I have not been able to obtain copies of these reports. Thefirst investigation, compiled in 1978, reportedly counted a total of 1.25 mil-lion deaths. The second, completed in 1984, reportedly based on a longerand more thorough investigation, was said to have concluded that the actualdeath toll was 1.73 million. The close correspondence between these fig-ures and the range of estimates that I generated independently by othermeans (1.1 to 1.6 million) gives me greater confidence in my earlier esti-mates and suggest that the underlying number actually is close to the highenendof my estimatedrange.Myconfidenceinthecredibilityof the article abouttheCentral Com-mitteeestimates is enhancedby additional detail itprovided.Inmy data-base,therewere atotalof29,646deaths directlylinkedto armedfactionalbattles—close to 16 percent of reported deaths that could be linked to spe-cific types of events.

That early investigation,which was of more limited scope than the second, reportedly counted 21.4million people who were“accused and attacked,”another 3.8 million whowere“accused and investigated"and another1.15 million“arrested andimprisoned"—a total of 26.4 million, close to the midpoint of my earlierpublished estimate of 22 to 30 million victims. The definition of“victim”covers only those directly attacked for political reasons during this period.Itexcludes theimpact of these attacksonclosefamilymembers ofthoseaccused, investigated, and imprisoned. During this period, one would190AGENTS OF DISORDERgenerally assume that a nuclear familyhad 4 to 5 members,which wouldsuggest,based on myestimated range of direct victims,that these persecu-tionsdirectly affectedanywherefrom106to150millioncloselyrelatedin-dividuals. The 1978 Central Committee investigation reported 123 mil-lion people who were“affected”in some way by these political attacks.23These are very large numbers—do they confirm the idea that China'sinternal upheaval of the late 1960s was among the largest in modern his-tory? As an aggregate number of deaths, 1.6 million would rank very highinanylistofinternalupheavalsthatdidnotinvolvesustainedconventionalwarfare.

In terms ofits magnitude, China’s upheaval indeed does rank among the costliest epi-sodes ofpoliticalviolenceinmodernhistory.The magnitude of the death toll, however, tells us little about the inten-sity ofviolence and repression.Thefact that events in China and Cam-Table8.3.Rankingof ComparisonCases by Scale

bodia generated similar death tolls is remarkableCambodia's populationwas a tiny percentage of China's.Anindividual living in Cambodia underthe Khmer Rouge was vastly more likely to be killed than an individual inChina during thehigh tide of the Cultural Revolution.In other words,China'slarge death toll ispartially an expression ofitsmassivepopulation.This makes it difficult to assess the intensity of China's upheaval in rela-tiontosevereepisodesinmuchsmallerpoliticaljurisdictions.Table 8.4 sheds light on this question by ranking cases according to theproportion of their populations killed. By this metric, deaths per thousand,the Cultural Revolution ranks at the bottom of the same group of cases.Cambodia and Rwanda are extreme cases,where 224 and 133 per thou-sand of their total populations, respectively, were killed (that is, 22.4 and13.3percent).Of the others,onlyBosnia (25.5per thousand)and El Sal-vador (15.3 per thousand) had death rates higher than 1 percent. All of theother cases are a fraction of one percent (below 10 per thousand), and Chi-na's overalldeath rate was 2.2per thousand.Itis noteworthy that thedeath rate in China during the Cultural Revolution was roughly on a parwith the death rate on Taiwan in1946,when theNationalistArmy en-gaged in widespread massacres in response to a rebellion on the islandagainst the imposition of Nationalist Chinese rule.Thefiguresinthetableindicate that anindividual inCambodiaunderthe Khmer Rouge was 110 times more likely to have been killed than an192AGENTS OFDISORDERindividual in China; in Bosnia, 12.5 times more likely. An individual intheSoviet Union duringStalin's“Great Terror”ofthelate1930swouldhavebeen somewhere between 2.5 and 3.7 times more likely to bekilled.Another way of illustrating these differences is to apply the death rates ofthese other cases to China’s much larger population. If the intensity of vio-lence andpersecutionin Chinahadbeenthesame asin Cambodia,China’sdeath toll would have been 161 million;in Bosnia,18.3 million; in theUSSR or Indonesia,between 2.8 and 5.6 million.By these standards Chi-na's late 1960s upheaval did not approach the intensity of these other cases.In anation the size of China,however,there is ampleroomfor wideregional variation.Were there regions where the intensity of violence ap-proached any of these other cases?The obvious place to examine is Guangxi,which has a justified reputation for having unusually high death rates. Theprovincial population was 20.8 million in the census of 1964: the death tollin classified investigation reports of 82,868 implies a death rate just below 4per thousand, which was twice the national average. This would placeGuangxi on a par with Guatemala's fierce counterinsurgency campaign oftheearly1980s,andnear thelowerendoftheestimatesfortheSovietGreatTerror of thelate1930s and Indonesian massacres of the mid-1960s.Onewouldhaveto examineindividual countiesandcitiestofind deathrates that were higher than the Guangxi average. There are 52 localities inthe database where the reported death rates are above the Guangxi averageof 4 per thousand—30of them,not surprisingly, are in Guangxi, but an-other 22 are not. The largest number of these was in Inner Mongolia (8),which had an unusually intense suppression campaign that targeted ethnicMongols.24 There are only 5 counties in the database where the reporteddeath rate exceeds 1 percent (or 10 per thousand). Three of them are inInner Mongolia, and their death rates, based on published annals, rangedfrom 14 to 17 per thousand.25 This was around 8 times higher than thenational average—close to the death rates generated by El Salvador's longand bloody civil war, but still well short of the Bosnian genocide of theearly1990s. On a national scale violence of this intensity was very rare.Nonetheless, in relatively rare cases——-in particular in Guangxi and InnerMongolia—there were localities where the intensity of the violence wouldhave ranked high among the most notorious cases in recent world history.In qualitative terms these years in China differ in fundamental waysfrom these comparison cases,which represent a variety of different kindsREPRESSIONUNLEASHED

193of political activity.Cambodia was a systematicliquidation of alleged classenemies by trained cadres in a recently victorious communist insurgencyThe Soviet Union was a case of state-directed terror by a well-establishedparty-state. Rwanda and Indonesia were mass killings of targeted sub-populations by local activists who were actively assisted by civilian andmilitary authorities.Bosniawas acase ofethniccleansingby armedmili-tants aspart of a nationalistinsurgency.El Salvador and Guatemalawerecases of rebel insurgency and counterinsurgency. Taiwan represented mili-taryreprisalsinresponsetoamassuprisingWhatis distinctive about thisperiodin Chinais thatit is amixture ofqualitatively different elements that parallel the above cases onlypartially,andonlypart ofthe time.Thefirst18monthsoftheperiodwehaveexam-ined was marked by a widespread insurgency of Red Guards, rebels, andrebel factions. There was no hint of this type of popular political mobiliza-tion in the cases of Cambodia or the Soviet Union—certainly no rebellionagainst established authority figures. There was widespread popular mobi-lizationin Rwanda,Indonesia,and Bosnia,but the mobilizations were ofmilitias that engaged in widespread mass killings of targeted ethnic groupsor suspected political enemies. China's factional insurgencies of 1967and1968borecertainresemblances totheconflictsinElSalvador, and the re-pression of rebel factions occasionally resembled the counterinsurgencycampaign in Guatemala.But only a smallfraction of the deaths generatedin China were the due to these kinds of conflicts,and they were limited tothe period prior to late 1968. China's Cleansing of the Class Ranks Cam-paign, on the other hand,bore a resemblance to the organized persecutionsof the Soviet“Great Terror”of 1937-38, although it generated much lowerdeathrates.The same is true of Cambodia undertheKhmerRouge.Somehistorians have suggested that Cambodia's unprecedented episode of masskilling was inspired by the ideology behind China's recent Cleansing Campaign, although the outcome in Cambodia was far more violent anddeadly.26 By contrast, only tiny percentages of those targeted in China’sCleansing Campaign were killed. Vastly higher percentages of those tar-geted as political enemies died in the USSR and Cambodia. The qualita-tivevariation over timein thekindsof political activity wehave examinedin China during these years, and the shifting balance of rebellion and re.pression, make it difficult to find direct parallels, and add to the enigmaticquality of this remarkably complex upheaval.194AGENTS OFDISORDERWhatismoststriking overall about thisperiod of Chinesehistory, andwhattrulydistinguishesitfromcomparablehistoricalepisodes,ishowmanypeople suffered severeforms of politicalpersecution but nonethelesssurvivedandlivedwellintothepost-Maoperiod,sometimesrisingonceagain into positions of authority. The same procedures utilized in estimatingthe death toll yield an estimate of roughly 26 million people who suffereddirect persecution during this period, and perhaps another 100 millionfamilymemberswhowereaffectedindirectly.Theestimateddeathtoll of1.6 million implies that for each person killed during this upheaval, 16 vic-tims survived. The overall number of victims was enormous,but the veryhigh rate of survival is perhaps the most distinctive feature of this periodof upheaval, and it is perhaps the reason why so many of those who livedthrough these years sought to document these events in ways that havemadethisbookpossible.9FINALOBSERVATIONS

THIS BOOK HAS UNFOLDED AS A SERIES OF PUZZLES, COMpel-ling me to shuttle back and forth between description and explanation. Sta-tistical patterns derived from city and county annals raised questions thatrequiredmetoexaminelocalnarratives,andnarrative accountssuggestedpossible answers that caused me toreturn to statistical patternsfor confir-mation.Thefinal analysis is theproductofthis shuttlingback andforthfrom description to explanation,from statistical patterns to narrative.Thecentral focus is the unfolding of events over time: their sequence and timing;shifts in national and local political contexts that presented evolving choicesto local actors; theinfluence of prior events on subsequent actions; thein-fuence of events at one level of the political hierarchy on thelevels below;and the reshaping of political conflict through interactions between indi-viduals and groups. Years ago, when I began this line of research, I sharedmy discipline's tendency to view rebellion as a function of the variable char-acteristics of groups and settings that promote orhinderpolitical mobili-zation. The puzzles that have presented themselves along the way were notonesthatIanticipated atthe outset.Workingonthissubjecthas alteredmy understanding of this extraordinary period of recent Chinese history,andalsomyunderstandingofthesociologyofpolitics.The first of these puzzles is why and how power seizures spread so widelyand so rapidly across the framework of the civilian party-state, despite thevery limited prior spread of popular insurgencies. Prior research, to the extent

19519%6AGENTS OFDISORDERhatit explicitly addressedpower seizures,unconsciously assumedthattheywereaproductofpopularrebellionsthatoverwhelmedthestate'sca-pacity to respond. Observations of events in Shanghai and other provin-cial capitals encouraged this assumption, but as one moves the focus awayfrom China's largest cities, the role of student and worker rebellions fadesin significance and the role of cadre rebels moves to center stage. The ex-tent towhich China's state structureswere overthrown rapidly across morethan2,100smallcities andruralcountieshas notpreviouslybeenunder-stood, nor has the role of party-state cadres in this process. The rapid col-lapse of state structures in early 1967was not the contest between agentsof the state and popular insurgents that is typically conceived in theoriesabout rebellion andrevolution.It was instead aninside-outprocess,inwhich the state's agents played a pivotal role in destroying the structuresto which their group interests were intimately tied.How could such a powerfully disciplined and centralized revolutionarystate collapse so quickly? As it turns out, this was precisely because it wasso disciplined and centralized. Even before the Red Guard movement wasunleashed,thenationalpoliticalhierarchywasshakenbyextensivenation-wide loyalty investigations that purged large numbers of ranking officialsand even larger numbers of lesser officials for alleged political offenses.These purges heightened the awareness of cadres across China that theyneededtostay on therightsideof theseunfoldingconflicts,in order toensurethatthey didnot themselvessuffer a similarfate.Political authori-ties nationwide welcomed and encouraged Red Guard mobilization, fol-lowing Mao's very public lead, but only so long as it was limited to the de-structionoftemplesand attacks onleadersofschools andworkplaces andotherordinarycitizens.Whenarebelwingbegantotargetlocalgovern-ments,manycadrescooperatedactivelywiththeirleaders’effortstodivertand blunt rebel attacks.But after these efforts were condemnedin the Oc-tober Party Conference in Beijing, cadres throughout China, whether ornot they had been Scarlet Guards, were compelled to reassess their politicalstances.The Scarlet Guard organizations rapidly disbanded, and many oftheir members and other cadres formed rebel groups to challenge theirsuperiors. When cadres in party and government organs were themselvesin rebellion, the authority of local leaders was more deeply underminedthanit was by student and worker demonstrations and their periodic of-ficeinvasions.

FINALOBSERVATIONS197The top-down cascade of power seizures in early 1967, combined withdetailed accountsoftheriseofthecadrerebels,revealedthatthesepoliticalprocesses, which were internal to the state's structures, were a type of col-lectivebehavior addressed inthreshold andcritical mass theories.Thesetheories emphasize the ways that group action is an outcome of dynamicinteractions: how individual decisions to act are contingent on the observedactionsofothers.Inthewakeof thecollapseofcommunistregimes acrossEastern Europe and Eurasia from 1989 to 1991, these models were appliedto the sudden and unexpected upsurge of popular rebellions. As it turnsout, these same collective processes apply equally to the agents of these uni-tary and centralizedstatestructures,whichsufferfromnone ofthe struc-tural faws identified in previous“state-centered”theories of revolution.Itis highly likely that the same processes were at work in East Germany,Czechoslovakia,theSovietUnion,and elsewhere during the“mass extinc-tion"ofcommunistregimes.In this case, however, I have modified a key assumption of these models.They typically assume, like interest group models, that the preferences ofindividuals arefixed——exogenous to the activities ofinterest.What changesin these models is the propensity of individuals to act on these preferences,something that is contingent on the actions of others. The cascade of in-ternal power seizures by cadre rebels was a process that was subtly different.What we observe is not a shifting propensity to act on prior political pref-erences,but a shiftinpolitical preferences.Thecollective choices of cadresviolated the interests that they presumably shared as a group—the preser-vation ofa system in which they held high status.Their collectivebehaviorserved to undermine these structures and ushered in a period of extraordi-naryupheaval.Inother words,threshold and criticalmass models of col-lective behavior apply not solely to the propensity to act on stable interests.They apply also to the endogenous formation of political preferences.The second puzzle is why new factions formed in the wake of these powerseizures, and why factional divisions intensified despite widespread mili-tary intervention ostensibly intended to support rebels who had seizedpower. The origins of these factional divisions, as we have seen, were thesamestructuralfeaturesthatpromotedrapidmobilizationofpoliticalaction in schools, workplaces, and party and government agencies. Red Guardand rebel organizations grew out of the organized networks that ordinarilyserved as theregime's instruments ofmobilization and control.Theresult

AGENTSOFDISORDER198was a pronounced pattern of bloc recruitment familiar to analysts in otherpoliticalsettings.This meant thatrebel alliancespriortoJanuary1967,evenwhere they existed,were fragmented collections of smaller solidary groups,each of which had their own leaders. This grass-roots pattern promoted mo-bilization,but it alsocontainedtheseedsof later divisions thatfatally dividedrebelmovements.In thevast majority of localities,the move to seize power was actuallythe first occasion where local rebels attempted to forge a coalition. In themany small cities and rural counties where there was limited or only na-scent rebel activity among students and workers, rebel cadres frequently co-ordinated rebel power seizures or seized power on their own.They movedquickly,under pressure createdbypower seizures in theprovince,cities,and prefectures above them. In the rush to act, many other rebel groupswereinevitablyleftoutofpowerseizures.Whentheyprotestedtheir ex-clusion, and moved into opposition, the seeds for new factional alignmentswere sown. In short, the limited development of popular insurgencies, andthe fragmented nature of rebel movements even where they fourished, werethefoundationfor theubiquitous splitscreatedby therushtoseizepoweracrossChina inearly1967.It was at this point that military intervention was crucial. The interven-tions of military actors in a setting of widespread rebel discord served tocrystallizethesenascentdivisions andhardenthemintoincreasinglyco-herent andself-consciouspoliticalfactions.Therole ofthe armedforcesincreating thefoundations for more than a year of factional warfare was re-vealedwhenitbecame clear thatmilitaryinterventionwasrapid andevenmore extensive than the wave of power seizures. Nascent divisions amongrebel groups were crystallized and hardened by theinterventions of armyofficers and local People's Armed Departments. The armed forces wereforced to choose sides, often haltingly and unwillingly, in the disputesamong rebel groups over power seizures, and their actions inevitably favoredoneside over another.Therebelswhowerefavoredbythe army's decisionsbecame their staunch supporters, while rebels whose claims were ignoredor denied by the military became their opponents. Initial moves by thearmed forces to suppress opposition hardened these splits, and the April 1967orders that undercut army authority and ordered the release of all prisonersand the legalization of banned rebel organizations fueled anti-army rebel-lions. This, in turn, compelled rebel groups initially favored by the armedFINALOBSERVATIONS

199forces into a closely supportive alignment with them.In a period when theinmilitarybackerswererestrainedfrom directly usingforce against their rebelopponents, their rebel supporters defended them, and in so doing defendedtheir own claims against those of their rivals.Support or opposition to local military control, then, did not expressinherentstances ofdifferentsocialgroupstotherestorationofthestatusquo ante,nor was it a continuation in maskedform of prior clashes be-tween groups opposed to,and supportive of, now-deposed local officials.These factional stances,instead,were the product of contingent politicalinteractions between the armed forces and rebel groups in the context ofdisputed claims about power seizures. If the armed forces supported yourclaims, you became their allies; if they supported your opponents and pun-ished you for disputing their actions, you became their opponents. Thisundercut the core of the reasoning behind interest group explanations andforced me to think about contentious politics in ways different from theparadigm of fixed interests in dynamic circumstances.Factional orienta-tions towardmilitarycontrolwere anexpression ofhistories ofinteractionamong local rebels and military units,not of some preexisting orientationtowardChina'ssocialandpoliticalorder.The third puzzle is why violent warfare between factions became sowidespread, and why it escalated over time, reaching a crescendo in 1968.To explain theformation offactions does notinitself accountforthevio-lencebetween them.Thispuzzleforced me toreverse the emphases of manytheories about rebellion,which focus on mobilizational capacity and repression, essentially how rebellions are sustained, and instead examine how re-bellions end—exit from collective action.Closer examination ofwhere andwhenviolentwarfareintensifiedledtothediscoveryofescalationtrapsinalimited number of regions that generated the largest casualties.The regions that languished for the longest periods of time under mili-tary control without a final political settlement—defined as the establish-ment of a revolutionary committee at both the provincial and local levelaccountedforthevastmajorityof theviolenceduring1967and1968.Moreover, in these regions, the intensity of factional warfare escalated overtime,reaching apeak shortlybefore a final political settlement.When aprovincewas placed quickly under a newform of government ratified byBeijing, and ultimately byMao Zedong,local compromise between nascentfactions was easier to obtain, and local revolutionary committees formed

AGENTSOFDISORDER200relatively quickly.Rebels who lost out in these settlements relinquished potentialgainsthatwouldhavecomefromvictory,buttheywouldnothavefaced severe retribution.Theselocalities experienced almost none of the fac-tional warfare observed in other regions of China.However,evenwithinprovinces that established revolutionary committees early in 1967, the es-tablishment of local revolutionary committees came almost to a halt afterstrictlimitswereplacedonmilitaryunitsinApril1967—andespeciallyafter challenges to military units were encouraged from Beijing in July ofthat year. After that point, even in provinces with early revolutionary com-mittees,localities that remained under military control suffered relativelyhighlevels of collectiveviolence that escalated thelongerthatmilitary con-trolenduredwithout afinalpoliticalsettlement.The upsurge of violence as political settlements approached in these re-gions suggested that factions had fallen into a kind of escalation trap.After acertainthresholdofviolentwarfarehadbeencrossed,eachsidefought with increasing intensity to avoid the retribution that would likelyfollowfrom theirdefeat.Rebelfactionsopposedtomilitarycontrolfoughtwithincreasingintensitytoforcetheremoval andreplacementofmilitarycommanderswhosupportedtheirrivals,whiletheopposedfactionsfoughtequally hard to ensure that supportive military commanders would remainto impose order in the form of a revolutionary committee.

This led to the otherwise somewhat anomalous pat-terninwhichtheintensityofviolenceescalatedtounprecedentedlevels asoverall levels of factional conflict declined.Patterns of suppression at theend of local insurgencies in these regions indicate that these expectationsaboutviolentretributionwererealistic.The fourth and final puzzle is why the largest numbers of casualties andvictims duringthisentireperiod—byfar—came only after thesuppres-sion of rebel insurgencies and the dismantling of their capacity to coordi-nate activities across workplaces. The casualties generated by the rebel in-surgencies andviolentfactionalism of1967and1968were dwarfed by thosedue to the repression of rebel groups and the subsequent rebuilding of thepolitical order. The vast majority of deaths and victims generated by the

As it turns out, the forces of order were far better orga-nized and far more active across China’s many political jurisdictions, andmost of China's adult population, not just factional combatants, were ex-posed to risk. Where one might have expected ferocious and deadly perse-cution campaigns,the reality was more mundane——the simple arithmeticofa national political hierarchy,with enormous reach,that could generatea massive toll of victims with relatively small numbers targeted in each localcommunity. Their application of force in the suppression of rebel organ-izations, and their conduct of the vast persecution campaigns designed toconsolidate political order after the suppression of rebel insurgencies, gen-erated far more deaths,and vastly morevictims,than the disruptiveinsurgencies to which they were a response.The analysis thatIhave offered in thisbook,which emphasizes eventsand processes, might appear to some readers to deny the salience of socialstructure. This is true only if one conceives of social structures as static regu-larities of the kind refected in patterns of inequality, occupational catego-ries, and formal organizations.

It also has emphasized the organization of workplaces,schools,andcommunities,whichwere alsostructuredinwaysdesigned toprevent independent political activity and to mobilize citizens towardregime-designated ends. In the altered context of late 1966, these samestructures promoted the pronounced pattern of bloc mobilization that ac-counted for both the widespread mobilization of ordinary citizens, especially202AGENTS OFDISORDERinlargecities,andatthesame timepromotedtheseverefragmentationand disunity that would serve to generate the factional rivalries that domi-nated Chinese politics in 1967 and 1968.There are also strong reasons to suspect that micro-level patterns of in-formalsocialrelationships,which arebarelyhinted atinthekindofsourcesemployed in this study,played an important role in many of the initial ri-valries that were reflected in patterns of bloc mobilization. There are hintsinthemostdetailedlocalaccountsofpossibledepartmentalrivalriesbe-tween cadres in the police and security apparatus and those in economicplanningdepartments.Itis easytoimaginethatthemost activemembersofScarletGuardorganizationshadcloserpersonaltiestotheirsuperiorsthan other cadres, who were not actively involved in them.

To fully reveal themwould require a detailed micro-level analysis of small-scalelocal settings.Findings from such a study, however, would not yield ready generalizationsacross local settings on a national scale, especially of the kind that interestgroup models derive from static categories based on occupational positionorrank.Afinalpoint about thekindofstructural analysispursuedinthisbookis that the social structures that informpolitical action arenomore staticthan the political orientations that evolve during sustained episodes of con-Aict.Moreover,the ones that matter most are not the ones that were exog-enously given by prior social categories,but instead were generated by eventsendogenous to these conficts. In the wake of power seizures, new politicalcategorieswere created based on structurally equivalent positions vis-a-viscertain rebels' claims to have seized power. These new categories served asthefoundationfor newinsurgentidentities,and theintervention of mili-taryunits served to crystallize these group differences and spur theforma-tion of more solidary and self-conscious political factions.Their ties to oneanother strengthened along with the antagonisms and conflicts that devel-oped with rival groups.

203lationship to patterns of political activity. In complex historical episodes,it would be a mistake to designate the groups defined by these static cate.gories as interest groups, and interpret the resulting conflicts through suchalenswithout careful attentiontothesequencesofevents andtheprocessesthroughwhichcollective actorsform.At theoutsetofthisbookIreferredtothis analysis asavarietyof"statecentered” explanation, though one that is distinct from the static macro-comparative theories of revolution to which that term has previously beenapplied. Instead, the focus has been on the political behavior of agents ofthe party-state, and the crucial impact that they had on the unfolding ofviolent political events.The first such instance was the collective behaviorof party-state cadres that generated the fast-developing internal rebellionsagainst local leaders and the rapid collapse of local state structures in early1967. The second was the interventions by military actors in the resultingdiscord among local rebels in the wake of that collapse. Their contingentinteractions with rival rebels crystallized emergent local cleavages and hard-ened the solidarities that generated the collective violence to follow. Themilitarization of these conflicts,and the alignment of rebel factionsfor andagainst military control, escalated the violence and its associated casual-ties.Finally, the reimposition of order, especially in regions where militarycontrol had endured the longest without a political settlement, generatedfar more casualties and victims than the factional warfare that preceded it.Throughout this period, actors typically viewed as the forces of order fu-eled and accelerated the upheavals and the damage that they wrought inways that could not have been anticipated by the presumed political inter-ests ofgroups at the outset.This is themost sobering,andperhapsthe mostfrightening, of the conclusions to be drawn from this study.APPENDIXLOCALANNALSDATASET

THE ANALYsis OF patterns of rebellion and repression pre-sentedinthisbookdrawson adatabaseofinformation extractedfromlocalannals (difang zhi) published in China in recent decades. The central gov-ernment mandated the publication of local annals for provinces, cities, andcounties in the mid-1980s. They contain a wide range of information aboutlocal history, geography, climate, the economy, and local administration.These annals were published gradually, primarily during the 1990s. Only14percentof cities andcountieshadpublished oneby1990,butby2001,more than 90 percent had done so. The last one consulted for this studywas published in 2015.

Longer periods of time were treated as summary statements and notenteredassingleeventsinthedatabase.Like anysourceofinformation,usersof adataset ofeventsculledfromprinted sources need to be sensitive to potential sources of reporting bias.The first issue of potential concern is that these are retrospective accountscompiled by local governments 20 or more years afterwards. The sourcesdo not approve of most of the activities that they describe, which raisesquestions about the political viewpoints of those who compiled the ac-counts.Somemight arguethatthese accountsrefected theviewpointsofthe victors, but it would be more accurate to say that they reflected the view-points of the survivors. These sources clearly disapprove of the disordersandviolenceoftheperiod,buttheynever takesidesinthefactionalcon-flictsthattheydescribe.What is perhaps most noteworthy about even the most detailed accountsis their striking lack of argumentation, analysis, and what passes for his-torical interpretation.This is most evidentin the“chronologies of majorevents,butitisalsocharacteristicofthemoredetailedhistoricalnarra-tives that arefrequentlyincludedin the annals.Thereis almostnoexplicitefforttocondemn or editorialize,nor is there anyeffort toexplain.Theannals describe factional battles, but they invariably take a strictly neutraltone: they do not portray one side as more commendable than another.Even thelongest and most detailedof thesupplementary narrative accountsare little more than chronological lists of events, sometimes accompaniedbystatisticaldetail.Thesesources arelesselaborate anddetailedthanthepress accounts that are commonly employed in analyzing protest move-ments in other settings.² Little more than factual chronologies of a streamof events, these accounts are especially useful for aggregation into a data-basethattraces theunfoldingofevents over time.Thesespare chronological accounts maynonetheless contain subtlebi-asesintroducedby thetypesofevents that aremorecommonlyreported，and the types about which they tend to be silent.The most obvious suchbias is a clear reticence about reporting the activities of military units,especially those that place their activities in a negative light. The violent

APPENDIX207activities of civilian rebels receive extensive coverage,while direct descrip-tion of the actions ofmilitary units arerare.There are 4,411reports ofviolent clashes between rebel factions in the data set,1,636 rebel actions againstmilitary units or military compounds,and another 753 actions by rebelsagainst government officials or offices—almost half of all the events re-cordedinthedatabase.Yetthere areonly350reportsofanytypeofre-pressive action by military or civilian authorities against rebel groupsfewer than 3 percent of all reported events.Other sources consulted forthisbookmakeabundantlyclearthatmilitaryunitsplayed acentralpoliticalrolethroughout this period,but this is notreflectedintheeventcounts from these sources.For this reason, I have relied extensively on othersources in my analysis of the role of the military.While there is little direct reporting of the activities of military unitsthere is an extraordinary amount of indirect evidence in these sources abouttheir activities.Thisbecomes abundantly clearwhenwe consider the dis-tribution ofciviliancasualties andotherindicators ofrepressioninthepe-riods of time when military units weremost active——in particular in themonths leading up to and immediately after the formation of military-dominated revolutionary committees.Despite the reticence of local an-nals about direct description of military activities, it is precisely during theperiods when army units fully exercised their powers of repression that ca-sualties and other victims, as reported in local annals, reached unprecedentedheights.Thereis,therefore,acleareditorial slant towardreportingviolenteventsby civilianrebels,and theimplicit editorial tone is one ofconcern,if notoutrightcondemnation.Theparty's official stancetoward theseevents,for-mulatedshortlyafterthedeathofMaoZedong,isthattheywere a di-saster for China—a clear reversal of what any account published duringMao'slifetimewould have contended(and such accounts wouldsurelyhavecompletely censored negativeinformation).Yet despite this evidentbias,the annals provide overwhelming evidence that the damage caused by rebelactivityduringthemostchaoticperiodwasonlyafractionofthatcausedbyrepression atthehandsofmilitaryunits andrevolutionarycommittees.How might these biases in reporting certain kinds of events more thanothers subtly shape analyses based on these sources? There is an extensiveliterature on the evaluation of confict data, much of it focused on the po-tential biases of newspaper reports, or of the differences between news

APPENDIX208sources and police or government records.3 The most useful way to discussthisquestionis inrelationto themajor conclusions thatIhave drawn inthis study. In particular, it is important to keep in mind that my analysisfocuses very heavily not simply what happened,or how often somethinghappened, but also when and wbere certain kinds of events are reported.The local annals do not describe Red Guard and rebel movements with ap-proval,but they do makeclear that theywere widespread and created con-siderablehavoc—but noteverywhere,and not all at once.One of thekeyconclusions thatIhavedrawnfromaccountsofthegrowthofstudent andworkerrebellionsisthattheywerenotveryfar advancedpriortothewaveof power seizures that began in late January 1967, and that therefore it ishard to credit popular insurgencies with the overthrow of local govern-ments. It is hard to conceive of reasons for a bias toward underreportingrebel activity prior to the wave of power seizures.It is hard to think of howsuch a bias might cause them to report an upsurge of these events during1967, only after the widespread interventions of military units, with whichthechroniclers appeartobesympathetic.The annalsmaytendtoreportmore ofsomekinds ofactivitiesthan others,butit ishard tothinkofrea-sons why they would be more likely to report events during some periodsoftimeratherthanothersSimilarly, despite the widespread reporting of disorders due to rebel ac-tivity,anddespitetheimplicitlyfavorableattitudeofthechroniclerstowardtherestoration oforder,the annalsreportfarmorecasualties andvictims at thehands of authorities than they doatthehandsofrebels,andthey report far more deaths and victims after the restoration of local govern-ments in 1968 than they report at any time in the preceding period of rebel-lion and“chaos.”Inshort,used with care,and with attention not simply towhatis reportedbutwhen andwhere,onecanextract a seriesof conclusionsthat are not plausibly related to the presumed biases of the annals, and thatcontradictwhatwemightsuspect arethecompilersimplicitbiases.The entire database covers events from June 1966 to December 1971,although in this book I draw on evidence only through the end of 1969by which point the suppression of the popular insurgencies of 1967-1968wascompleted.Itcontainsinformation aboutarange ofpoliticaleventsina total of2,246 political jurisdictions.4 This is 98 percent of the 2,293 coun-ties andcitiesinexistencein1967.Some of thejurisdictionsinexistenceat that time have been abolished or combinedwith others; counties have

APPENDIX209become cities; and citieshave absorbed countiesinto theirboundaries.Thesechanges have been reconciled by consulting standard compendia of admin-istrativeboundaries,alongwithlocalhistories,toensure thatwehave notomitted jurisdictions and that the information we have collected corre-sponds only to onelocation.Where we were unable to link information tothe 1967 boundaries, we either left that jurisdiction as missing, or consoli-dated that information with a larger jurisdiction that merged earlier onesinto a single unit. There were very few cases that we were unable to re-solve.Thedatabasecontainsinformation about closeto33,400eventsdatedtothemonth that they occurred,and somewhat more thanhalf (17,800)accordingtothespecificdaythattheyoccurred.The work of locating these volumes and photocopying relevant sectionsfor later analysis began in 1996, and was almost completed twelve yearslater. Two sections were the primary sources of relevant information. Thefirst, included in almost every volume, is a “Chronology of Major Events”(dasbiji)—alistingofnotableeventsof allkinds.Allbut19of thelocalannals contained this standard chronology. The second are separate sec-tions devoted to describing political events and Communist Party history-sometimes under the subheading“major political campaigns"or “CulturalRevolution."Only 65 percent of the annals contained relevant informationabout events in these other sections.In a small number of cases(104)wealso recorded relevant information from other sources about specificjurisdictions.I have made this database publicly available, along with full documen-tation,code sheets, and instructions for coders.Those who are interestedin the data and in the details of how the data set was compiled will findthese materials online through my faculty page on the website of StanfordUniversity's Department of Sociology.* I encourage interested scholars toanalyzethesedataforthemselves andpublishtheirresults.Iwilllimitthediscussion here to matters that will help readers understand the sources ofinformation used in the tables and figures presented in this book. Thosewho want greater detail about specific subjects are free to explore the data-base anddocumentationon theirown.For statistical purposes, this data set should not be conceived as a sampleof counties and cities—almost all of them are represented in the data set.It should be considered a non-probability sample of relevant local politicalevents.The compilers oflocal annals decided whichevents toreport,basec210APPENDIXonevents aboutwhichtheyhadinformationwhichinturnwas only asubset of allrelevantevents.Clearly,only afraction ofthepoliticaleventsthat occurred nationwide during this period are recorded in local annals.This is true for all confict data sets, whatever their source of information.?Aprobability samplewouldbeginwithalistof alllocalities and allrele-vantevents,andwouldsamplerandomlyfromtheselists.Bydefinition,conflict data sets are never representative probability samples. Unlike mostdatasets of thistype,this oneincludesinformationfrom the samekind ofsource for virtually every jurisdiction.10 The primary concern, therefore, isvariation in the likelihood that local annals will report events, which willreflect both editorial decisions and the resources devoted to compiling localhistories.llExcluded almost by definition are many hundreds of thousands of small-scale events——surely millions—that occurred within individual schools,factories,andcollectivefarms.Onlythelargest andmostconsequential ofthese are mentioned in histories compiled at the county or city level. Thisis not a serious drawback.I am interested ininsurgent activities that tar-geted provincial, city or county governments and their leaders, or actionsby the forces of order to suppress rebellion. Activities that do not have animpactbeyondtheboundariesofschoolsorworkplacesdonotbeardirectlyon the questions of interest in thisbook.In other words,the sources arebiased toward reporting events that are relevant to the questions that I ask.However, these materials also report only a fraction of the larger andmore consequential events that are relevant to this inquiry—for exampleinvasions of government offices, clashes between rebel groups and the armedforces,armedbattlesbetween insurgentfactions,seizures ofpartyofficials,and military suppression of armed insurgents. Even for the events that arerecorded inthese annals,information about theirimpact interms of thenumber of people involved, or the number of deaths, injuries, or other con-sequences of the action is also incomplete.Due tolimitations of informa-tion availableto thosewhocompiledlocalhistories,thelevelof effort andresources put into thecompilation, and theinherent biases refected in whatis considered appropriate or important enough to report, all data of thissort arefiltered.Thedatasetis anonprobabilitysamplefromanunder-lyingpopulationof events,and any attempt to drawinferencesfrom it mustdeal carefully with the potential biases of the sample.12

APPENDIX211With newspaper data,there is no way to systematically gauge likelysampleselectionbias.With avirtuallycompletecollectionoflocalhisto-ries, however, the issue is not coverage but levels of detail. Each localityprovides anarrative account,sothequestionofregionalbias,soprevalentin news accounts, is not a concern.The problem, instead, is variation inlevels ofcoverageoflocaleventsin theselocalhistories.Thelevelofrele-vantdetailinlocalannalsvariedconsiderablyatthelevelofcounties,cities,andprovinces as a whole.For eachjurisdiction,the coders recordedthetotalnumberofChinesecharacters devoted todescribing all localeventsof whatever kind during this period of time.This is a way of gauging thequality and level of detail in local accounts, and how the length of an ac-countinfluenced thelevel ofstatistical andnarrativedetail thatitcontained.Inmultivariatemodels,thelength of the account canbeemployed in two-stage models designed to correct for sample selection.13One Chinese character is not equivalent to one word in English: manyChinesewordsare compoundsof two ormorecharacters.Tomakevaria-tions in length more intelligible, I define one page as equal to 500 Chinesecharacters. The average number of relevant pages in local annals was 9.9pages; the median was 7.4.14 The number of pages is strongly related to levelof urbanization,which in turn is related totheresources available tolo-calities in compiling local histories. Annals from provincial capitals con-tain an average of 38.5 relevant pages; other prefecture-level cities, 19.9pages; county-level cities, 15.1 pages; and counties, 9.0 pages. There are alsowide differences in provincial averages. The most detailed annals by far werefrom Shaanxi Province (an average of 22.7 pages) and the two provincial-level cities of Beijing (20.7 pages), and Shanghai (16.7). At the opposite endof the range, 5 provinces averaged fewer than 6 pages——Jiangxi, Hubei,Anhui, Zhejiang, and Tibet. Tibet's were the least detailed——an average ofonly 3.3 pages. The provincial average was 10 pages, and the median was9.6, which means that the provincial averages were not particularly skewed.15The two most important determinants of the length of an account isthe province in which it was published and the jurisdiction's level of ur-banization.Ina simpleequation thatpredicts accountlength,province ac-counts for 15.7 percent of the variation (r-squared = .157). The secondmost important determinant is the size of the urban population, whichaloneaccountsforanother13percentofvariation,andwhichtogetherwith212APPENDIXprovince accounts for more than 27 percent of variation (adjusted r-squared=.271).A jurisdiction's total population is very weakly related to accountlength——it explains less than 5 percent of overall variation in account lengthby itself, and when added to an equation with province and urban popula-tion it does not have a significant net impact. This suggests that the lengthof accounts is a product of provincial editorial policy, as suggested by opendebates conducted in journals devoted to the compilation of local annalsduring the 1980s, which pitted those who insisted that these politically sen-sitiveeventsbechronicledonlyin“broadstrokes,”while othersinsisted onmore extensive detail.1 Also important is level of urbanization, which sug-gests that localities at higher levels of industrialization had more adminis-trativeresourcestodevotetothe compilationofthehistoricalsections oftheirannals.The next question is how the length of accounts is related to the reportingof different kinds of events and relatednumbers of deaths,injuries,andvictims.Itshouldbeevidentthatnot allevents ofpotentialinterestwerereported in local annals, and not all of them provided similar levels of nar-rativeorstatisticaldetail.Iassumethatthelengthofan accountisstronglyrelatedtothelikelihoodthataneventwouldbereported,andespeciallytothe likelihood that these events would be reported in detail. In reading largenumbers of these accounts over the years it is clear that many annals de-scribe major upheavals in highly cryptic terms, or refer to deaths or inju-rieswithoutprovidingnumbers.Thesebroadreferences donotcontributeevidencetothedatabase,for the simplereasonthat adescribedevent hastobe dated at least to a specificmonth before it can be coded as an eventfor our purposes. Similarly, events that do qualify for inclusion, but thatdo not provide data about casualties or victims, are coded as reporting “0”"casualties or victims,rather thantreated as missingcases.On the other hand, brief accounts might also indicate that there actu-ally were few political events of interest during this period, and thereforethat shorter accounts mean that there were fewer events to report.Whilethis is surely true to some extent, the length of accounts is unlikely to cor-respondcloselytotheactuallevelofpoliticalconfictinthelocality.Onereason is that“chronologies of major events”are not limited to politics—they describe anything noteworthy that occurs. This can include the com-pletion of major construction projects, natural disasters, epidemics, the im-plementationofgovernmentpolicies,localpartyconferences,andreports

APPENDIX213of bumper harvests or levels of industrial production.Variation in thesesectionsreflectsthelevelofresourcesdevotedtothecompilationanded-iting of annals,combined witheditorial decisions about how toreport sen-sitive topics. These sections sometimes betray obvious signs of this kind ofself-censorship. One frequently finds that the sections devoted to majoreventsfor1967through1971aremuchshorterthanfortheimmediatelypreceding or subsequent years. It may be the case that there were few con-flict events during these periods, but it is highly unlikely that there werefewerevents of anykind.In addition,thefactthatlocalcompilers chosenot to provide a separate section that describes major political campaigns,orspecializedhistorical accounts devoted to the CulturalRevolution,is it-self a reflection of editorial decisions guided by political considerations,and to some extent perhaps a result of resource constraints.Certain kinds of events were very widely reported——in particular manyoftheclose to19,oooevents thatwerethe“firstreport”of certainland-mark events—for example, the first appearance of student Red Guards, thefirst appearance of“rebel"organizations that targeted local government of-ficials,the date ofthefirstlocal military intervention,the date ofapowerseizure that deposed the local government, and the date that a revolutionarycommittee was established. These events were reported by the vast majorityof jurisdictions: 81 percent report a rebel power seizure over the local gov-ernment; 90 percent reported the existence of local Red Guard activity;93percentreported thelocalinterventionofmilitaryunits;andmore than99 percent reported the establishment of a revolutionary committee. Thesefigures make very clear that key events related to the major conficts of thisperiod occurred in the vast majority of local jurisdictions. The only signifi-cant variation for this subset of events is in their timing.Because suchlarge percentages of localities reported these landmark events, and becausethere is no reason to suspect systematic bias in the reporting of the datethat they occurred, we can be highly confident that the distribution of theseevents over time accurately portrays actual time trends.Although the vast majority of localities reported these landmark events,they varied greatly in how much additional detail that they reported. Eachjurisdiction could report no more than 1“landmark”event,but there wasno limit on the reporting of armed conflicts between mass factions, attacksby rebels on government agencies, clashes between rebels and military units,the armed suppression of rebels, or the conduct of political campaigns214APPENDIXdesigned tosuppress dissent.Therewas widevariationindetail onthesekinds ofevents,andin addition,therewas considerablevariationin theex-tenttowhichlocalannalsrecordedstatisticsonthenumberofindividualskilled, injured, or otherwise victimized by the events that were reported.The total number of these“repeatable”events in the database is14,259Nosingleprovincereportedmorethan10percentofthisnumber.Only3contributed more than 5 percent—Hebei (6.9 percent), Shaanxi(9.5 percent), and Sichuan (10 percent). At the opposite end of the distri-bution, 5 provincial jurisdictions contributed less than1 percent of the totalreported events,but all were jurisdictions with small populations (the citiesof Beijing and Shanghai, and the provinces of Ningxia,Qinghai, and Tibet).The most common single type of event was an“armed battle” (wudou) be-tween mass factions(4,390).The distribution across provinces in reportingthis type of event was more skewed than for the overall number ofevents—the same5provinces that reported the lowest number of eventsoverall alsocontributedfewer than1percentofthetotalnumber ofarmedbattles. At the high end, the same three provinces were at the top of thedistribution, and their respective contributions were 6.6 percent (Hebei),10.5 percent (Sichuan), and 12.2 percent (Shaanxi). In sum, certain prov-inces appear to be more highly represented in the counts of events,but thevariations appear to roughly correspond to the relative population num-bers in these jurisdictions (for example, Sichuan's population was 10 timesthat of Beijing in 1967, and Shaanxi's was 10 times that of Qinghai).Of greater concern are much wider disparities in the level of statisticaldetail linked to the reported events. Guangxi Province provided an unusu-ally high level of statistical detail, even though its annals did not provideunusuallyhighlevelsofnarrative detail.As aresult,thisprovince,whosepublished annals contributed only 4 percent of the total number of eventsin the database, contributed 23 percent of the reported deaths.17 The nexthighestnumberofdeathslinked tospecificeventswasinGuangdongProv-ince, which contributed 9.9 percent of the total. The reporting of injurieslinked to specific events was less skewed—Yunnan, Sichuan, and InnerMongolia each contributed between 17.2 and 17.8 percent of the totalnumber ofreportedinjuries(Guangxi only5.2percent).Thereportingofvictims of some form of political persecution was even less skewed,withno province contributing more than 11.5 percent and another 5 contrib-uting between 7.7 and 8.8 percent (Guangxi contributed only 4.8 percent))

APPENDIX215The one concern raised by this discussion is the exaggerated role ofGuangxi in reports ofdeaths.Because that oneprovince contributed23 percent of the total reported deaths from all conflict events, the distri-bution of deaths across event types or across time may distort our aggre-gate analysis for the country as a whole. The primary concern about Guangxiis only about the reporting of deaths—the province contributed only4percent of conflictevents,and only4.8percent ofvictims ofpersecution.The distribution ofevent counts across the11different categories in oundatasetforGuangxiisalmostidenticaltothedistributionofreportedeventtypes in the rest of the country. However, the number of deaths that re-sulted from different types of events in Guangxi diverges from the aver-ages for the rest of the country. A much smaller percentage of Guangxi'sreported deaths come from armed battles between mass factions (6.6 versus19.1 percent elsewhere); a much higher percentage of deaths come from thearmed suppression of rebels (13.5 versus 0.7 percent elsewhere); and some-what higher percentages of the deaths were due to other unspecified ac-tions by authorities (20.5 versus 13.2 elsewhere).These differences refectthe extremelyharsh armed suppression of rebel opposition in the summerof1968,which is describedinChapter8The distribution of deaths in Guangxi over the months of observationalso diverges considerably from the rest of the country. The deaths reportedfor Guangxi are highly concentrated in a 5-month period from April toAugust 1968.These 5 months contained 85 percent of the total deaths re-ported in Guangxi for the entire 67 months from June 1966 to De-cember 1971. Just below 30 percent of Guangxi's total occurred in one ex-traordinarily violent month—August 1968. The comparable percentagefor the same 5-month period in the rest of the country is 56 percent, andforAugust1968only12percent.Because of this concentration of deaths in a short period, and by a prov-ince that reported unusually high death counts,it is likely that Guangxi'sexperience distorts the national profile of violence over time.Figure A-1helps us tovisualize the way that the Guangxi data might alter our view ofnationaltrends.The solid line represents China as a whole, including Guangxi, and thedashed line represents China as a whole, excluding Guangxi. The trend linesare almostidenticaluntilMarch1968,atwhichpointGuangxi'snumbersbegin to push the national totals upward. Guangxi's impact is first evident216

The concernabout the distorting effect of Guangxi should be limited primarily to JulyandAugust.This,however,raises a more difficult question.Because Guangxi's sta-tistical reporting is unusually complete, and because the province has a de-served reputation for being particularly violent during these months,howcanwe decidehowmuch of Guangxi'snumbers distort nationalpatterns,and how much the high death rates in Guangxi deserve to be included inthe national totals? There is no easy answer to this question, but it is clearthat any concerns that we have about Guangxi's oversized contribution tooveralldeathrates should befocusedon afewmonthsinmid-1968.Theclose correspondence between the trend lines for Guangxi and the rest ofthe country, however, encourages confidence that any distortions will berelativelymodest and easy toidentifyNOTESI.

McCarthy and Zald (1977, 1215), quoting fromTurner and Killian (1972, 251), made an even more widely known statement ofthe same principle:“We are willing to assume ... that there is always enoughdiscontent in any society to supply the grass-roots support for a movement if themovement is effectively organized and has at its disposal the power and resourcesof some established elite group.42.For a more detailed presentation of this argument, see Walder (2009b). Notableexceptions to this overall trend are scholars who continued to focus on the socialorigins of varied political orientations of rural rebellions (Paige 1975; Perry1980), trade union movements (Kimeldorf 1988; Perry 1993), and the condi-tions under which class,ethnic or alternative identities find political expression(Hechter 1975;2000;2004;2013;Kalyvas 2008;Olzak1992).43.Fearon (2004); Fearon and Laitin (2003); Toft (2003).44.

Long ago, Oberschall (1973, 26) observed:“In situations of conflict where theaggregate outcome is determined by theintersection of several mutuallydependent choices that cannot be treated as independent events, an interactionmodel of the process...is the appropriate model."47. Parenthetically, this is why there is almost always a very large “error term” inregression equations, because variable based models often do not capture these

“stochastic"processes.48. The term and definition are Roger Gould's (1995). This is entirely different fromthe psychological conceptions of personalidentity that some analysts claim to becrucial for political commitment and activism.49. Zheng (2006);Walder (2009a, 211-215).A contrasting interpretation of thiscase is by Andreas (2009, 111-130), who emphasizes the fact that the two rebelfactions that eventually emerged at Tsinghua expressed different stances towardthe university's status quo.While demonstrating convincingly that there were nosystematic differences in the membership or leadership of the two factions,henonetheless treats the content of the factions'rhetoric as expressions of under-lying orientations that were presumably stable.50. As argued by Wu (2014b).51. Munson (2008).52.Markoff (1996);Markoff and Shapiro (1985)

NOTESTOPAGES15-2422153. Lee (1979, 302-322) offered a content analysis of factional newspapers inGuangzhou to substantiate his claim that thefactions had different orientationstoward the status quo.The most pronounced difference,not surprisingly, wastoward the armed forces (p. 318).More recent work (Yan 2015)has shown thatthese political stances were adopted only after rebel disputes over the provincialpower seizure and different responses to the imposition of military control. Yanshowed that the faction originally deemed“radical”for opposing what theyclaimed was a“fake” power seizure was later portrayed “conservative” forsupporting the armed forces for their unwillingness to ratify that power seizure.54. Two classic works that deploy this concept with great effect are McAdam (1982),and Tarrow (1989).More recent developments of the concept are Koopmans(1993); Meyer and Staggenborg (1996); and Meyer and Minkoff (2004).55. See Dong and Walder (2011b; 2012a); MacFarquhar and Schoenhals (2006,99-101);and Walder (2015,202-207;253-262).56.An early review of this work by Olzak(1989) distinguished usefully betweenstatic,cross-sectional research designs and dynamic analyses of sequences ofevents. The precursor of contemporary research in this vein was Sorokin (1937,383-506),whose work strongly influenced Charles Tilly.Examples of the analysisof long-term patterns of change include a range of studies of 19th and20th century Europe (Shorter and Tilly 1968; Tilly 1995b; Tilly, Tilly, and Tilly1975); and ethnic conflict and racial violence in the United States (Olzak 1992;Tolnay and Beck 1995).Examples of the analysis of relatively brief and intenseepisodes of conflictinclude analyses of theFrench Revolution and its immediateaftermath (Markoff 1996; 1997; Markof and Shapiro 1985), a tumultuous decadeof protest and disorder in postwarItaly (Tarrow1989);and theregional mobilizations that led to the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union (Beissinger 2002).57.

Local attacks on party and government organs persisted well into 1969, but90 percent of them had occurred by the summer of 1968.This number does notincludeinvasions of party and government headquarters that occurred during arebel power seizure. Rebel power seizures, all but one of which occurred after theend of 1966, are analyzed separately in Chapter 4.3. Beijing, a province-level jurisdiction like Shanghai, was also the seat of thenational government, and many of the central government ministries andcentral party agencies were deeply disrupted during the last half of 1966.However, the national insurgency was also directed by the Maoist core of thecentral party-state, which was never subjected to rebel attacks in ways that partyauthorities were elsewhere.Moreover, the Beijing city government and partyorganization were devastated by the purges of May and June 1966, whichremoved at a stroke theincumbent officials who became the targets of rebelmovements in other cities in subsequent months. Tianjin did not become aprovince-level city until late in 1967; it was still a county-level city in HebeiProvince.4.

The latter explained the upsurge of laborstrife in late 1800s Chicago as bloc mobilization of ethnic loyalties amongimmigrant groups.2. Oberschall (1973, 143) observed,“A heterogeneous leadership and membership,loosely held together in their pursuit of some common goals, comes intobeing....Yet, the movement will have little central organization, and theprimary loyalties of the members may be to the component groups, leaders, andassociations, and not to the overarching movement itself. Each group seeks tohave its leaders recognized.... There are no preestablished norms for choosingor establishing topleaders,and their authority does not rest on institutionalpositions. There are no agreed upon, legitimized procedures for reachingcollective decisions."3.

The development of factions even where there had been no power seizure shouldnot be surprising. Many of these localities had active rebel groups that hadseized power in their offices or places of work,but had not yet attempted toseize power over the entire government. In these localities rebel movementswere alsofragmented, and they presented many of the same dilemmas to armyunits.3. MacFarquhar and Schoenhals (2006, 175).4.

The order went out on September 5, 1967 (UnionResearch Institute 1968,505-510).2.The events include violent clashes between rebel factions, rebel attacks onmilitary or government installations, and any other action by rebels thatgeneratedvictims or casualties.3.The numbers for 1968 were inflated by a month-long battle in the city ofLuzhou,Sichuan, which generated a reported 2,0o0 deaths. This created thelarge spike in deaths in July 1968. Even if we discount that extreme case, it isstill clear that levels of violence escalated as the number of violent eventsdeclined.4. For example,Tarrow (1989, 305-310) explained the escalation of violence nearthe end of a cycle of protest in Italy in the early 1970s as a strategic response bysmall groups to revive a dying movement in theface of an overall decline inlarge-scale protest.

In Guangxi, the “April 22” faction,which opposed forces under the militarydistrict commander, relied heavily on the support of PLA unit 6984 for itssurvival.When they learned that the unit was to be transferred elsewhere, theypleaded with the commander to disobey his orders.Their departure was delayedfor only a month,until February 1968, sealing the fate of this“anti-army”rebelfaction, and ushering in the massacres that made Guangxi's death tolls thehighest in the country (Guangxi Cultural Revolution Chronology 1990,69-70)7.

By averaging across the entire duration, this would tend toweaken the measurable impact of escalation near the end,and therefore makes itsomewhat less likely that we will detect differences across periods of differentduration.15. See the longer discussion in Walder (2014).16.Full details about the statistical procedures,including the regression results fromthe model described above, is provided in Walder and Chu (2018).17.Attentive readers will note that there is a degree of endogeneity that contributesto these statistical results——that is,regions with more severe violence will likelydelay theformation of localrevolutionary committees,leading to longer periodsunder military control. This is unlikely to make these results spurious, however.Figure 7.2 indicates that violence escalated over time in all regions, and236NOTESTO PAGES167-171

Figure7.7indicates thatitescalatedover timeinregionsthatstilllacked apolitical settlement.Moreover, the duration of the period without a politicalsettlement is jointly defined as a revolutionary committee at both the provincialand local level. In 36 percent of the 1,853 localities in provinces placed undermilitary control, the local revolutionary committee was established during thesame month as the provincial revolutionary committee, or earlier. In these cases,thelengthoftimewithout apoliticalsettlementwouldnotbeanendogenousoutcomeoftheintensityoflocalconflicts.18. As noted in Figure A.1, in the Appendix, death tolls in Guangxi Province duringthe period from April to August 1968 formed an especially large percentage ofthe nationwide total.This raises the possibility that the statistical results I havejust reported are biased by extreme events in Guangxi. A close examination ofthe data set rules out this possibility. Of the 235 insurgent clashes in the databasefrom April through August 1968 that were included in the analysis presented inFigure 7.8, only 6 percent were from Guangxi, with an average death toll of 7.8per event (compared to an average of 4.5 deaths for this subset of events). Shaanxiprovince,by contrast,contributed 25 percent of the cases in this group,and theyaveraged 9.0 deaths per event.The very high overall death tolls in Guangxi notedin the Appendix were generated almost exclusively by repression of rebel insur-gents or by mass reprisals carried out by the victorious faction,and almost all ofthem occurred only after an imposedpolitical settlement.These casesby definition were not among the factional clashes represented in Figures 7.7 and 7.8.19.

The same procedures yielded an estimate of 22 to 30 millionvictims, which implies that the local annals reported much more completenumbers about this item——some 45 to 61 percent of the underlying totals.21. The detailed statistical report on the two purported Central Committeeinvestigations is in Li Zijing (1996, 17). The article's sensationally inaccuratetitle claims a death toll of 26 million, confusing the death toll with the numberof reportedvictims——see thefollowing discussion.22.The Central Committee numbers evidently covered the entire decade from 1966to 1976,but levels of violence and the intensity of persecution campaignssubsided greatly after 1971, the last year covered by my database. Becauseinsurgent activity ebbed rapidly during1968,I do not analyze events beyond1969 in this book.23. Li Zijing (1996, 17).24. See Wu Di (2010) and Yang Haiying (2014).25. One of the five was Dao County, Hunan, where startlingly widespread masskillings directed by authorities in late 1967 resulted in a reported death toll of4,519,just below 1.2 percent of the population at the time. The case has beendocumented in great detail, based on classified investigation reports, by ZhangCheng (2001, 66-67) and Tan Hecheng (2017).26. See Chandler (1999,66-67) and Kiernan (2002,330).9.FINAL OBSERVATIONS1.Individual action in thesemodels is typically interpreted in purely strategicterms, but this is not logically necessary. The same actions can just as readily beinterpreted as efforts to act in conformity with moral or political commitments.In the case of cadre rebels (and even the Scarlet Guards),for example, theirchanging stances toward their superiors can be interpreted either as a rational

NOTES TOPAGES 201-209239and strategic response designed to ensure personal survival, or as a realizationthat their previousloyalties werebased on a misunderstanding of the correctactions expectedbyloyalCommunists—orboth.2. The phrasing is Martin's (2009, 2), describing the approach to social structurecentral to the sociology of Georg Simmel (1955[1922]).APPENDIX1. The persons harmed were counted in nonoverlapping categories as deaths,injuries, or “victims.”The last category included anyone who was targeted by apolitical accusation,mistreated in rallies,held captive,imprisoned,removedfrom their jobs or from urban residence, or physically abused.2.For example,Tarrow (1989,357-366)3.For example, Davenport and Ball (2002); Earl, Martin,McCarthy, and Soule(2004); Franzosi (1987); McCarthy, McPhail, and Smith (1996); Mueller (1997);Myers and Caniglia (2004); Oliver and Maney (2000); Oliver and Myers (1999);White(1993)4. To be more precise, 84 prefecture-level cities (diji shi), 90 county-level cities(xianji shi),and 2,072 other county-level units (1,945 counties [xian],67autonomous counties [zizhi xian], 54 banners [gi], and 6 nonstandard county-level jurisdictions—towns [zhen] special districts [tequ] and forestry districts[linqu]).5. All but 3 of the 47 missing localities are in Tibet (39) or a Tibetan prefecture inQinghai (5). There is one missing jurisdiction each from Xinjiang, InnerMongolia, and Guangdong (Hainan).6. The source used to track these changes is Ministry of Civil Affairs, People'sRepublic of China (1998), which provides annual lists of local cities andcounties, by province, and provides explanations of boundary changes.7. In 86 of these cases we extracted only summary statistical data on numbers ofdeaths,injuries,and victims from 18volumes of detailed internal investigationreports for Guangxi Province (Guangxi Party Committee 1987). In the remaining18 cases, from 11 other provinces, we drew upon published communist partyhistories, separate compilations of local historical materials, or unpublishedchronologies of“major events”during the Cultural Revolution,and coded all of thereported events as a supplement to or substitute for less detailed published annals.The Guangxi statistical data will be drawn upon only at the end of chapter 8, whereI develop estimates of the overall death toll during this period.The extremelydetailed narrative accounts in these reports,however, are drawn upon repeatedly todocument confict processes below the level of provincial capitals.8.At the time of publication, the web address that provides access to the data setand documentation was https://stanford.app.box.com/s/1p228gewy2pjd3817ksq240NOTESTOPAGES 210-214

9kd4d6cz3jy8.In subsequent years the data set will be placed in a public datarepository.9. The key concern from a sampling perspective is whether the absence of a reportsignifies the absence of a confict event (Danzger 1975; Franzosi 1987; Mueller1997;Myers and Caniglia2004;Oliver andManey2000;Snyder andKelly1977). This is a classic problem of sample selection bias.10. Most studies of this type rely on information culled from newspapers, whichraises concern about biases in regional coverage, especially when national-levelnewspapers or a small number of large regional newspapers are employed (Earl,Martin,McCarthy and Soule 2004).11. The parallel concern with newspaper-derived data is selectivity in editorialdecisions about what kinds of events are considered newsworthy (McCarthy,McPhail and Smith 1996). Government-compiled data sets are affected bypotential biases in legal regimes and policing practices.12. In particular, one must consider the likelihood that the reporting of events or ofdetail aboutthemwillbecensoredbyeditorialdecisions orbydifferentlevelsofeffort put into the compilation of local histories. A more extended discussion ofthese problems for the current data set is in Walder (2014).13. Two of the most common are Heckman two-step estimators and zero-infatednegativebinomial regression.The former was employed to estimate theunderlying number of deaths and victims in Walder (2014); the latter wasemployed to test arguments about the escalation of violence in Chapter 7.14. The average number is skewed by a small number of very long accounts. Forexample,6 annals, all from major cities,had accounts longer than78 pages, andby far thelongest—for Guangzhou—was176pages.15.By contrast,the 18-volume compilation ofinvestigation reports for Guangxi,which became available only after the database was in its final stages ofpreparation, contain an average of just under 50 pages for its 86 cities andcounties (Guangxi Party Committee 1987).16.See the debate describedinWalder andSu (2003,79-80)17. Here I refer to the statistics linked to specific events in Guangxi's published localannals, not the summary statistics contained in the much more detailed internalinvestigation reports. Guangxi's high level of published statistical detail wassurely due tothe compilation of detailedinvestigationreportsfor every city andcounty in the province during the mid-1980s.This classified 18-volumecompendium(Guangxi Party Committee 1987)was available to compilers oflocalannals.REFERENCESAbbott, Andrew. 2001.Time Matters: On Theory and Method.Chicago: University of

Over the years,a longlist ofgraduatestudents,mostly atStanfordUniversity,have contributed tothephotocopying, coding,and compilation of the data set employed in this book.Theyinclude Yang Su,Fei Yan,Lizhi Liu,Shinichi Tanigawa,Zheng Lu, Songhua Hu,Weiwei Shen,Xiaobin He,Dian Yang,Chunlei Wang,Timothy Wai-keung Tam, andLitao Zhao.Several of them deserve special thanks.Yang Su directed the compilationof a smaller earlyversion of the data set and devised many of thecoding schemes thatwere revised and adapted for the final product.He also employed part of the earlydata set in his dissertation, which later yielded an award-winning book on collectivekillings in severely affected regions of China.Lizhi Liu,Weiwei Shen,Xiaobin He,and Fei Yan were core members of the research team that helped to test and revise thefinal codebook and to code the materials included in the completed data set.Fei Yanworked closely with me in the first phases of data cleaning and provided indispensableassistance in bringing the final product to completion.He has also utilized part ofthese materials in his own research and publications on Guangzhou.Funding for this project was generously provided over the years by several entitiesatStanfordUniversity:theShorensteinAsia-PacificResearchCenter,theFreemanSpogli Institute for International Studies,and the School of Humanities and Sci-ences.TheNationalScienceFoundation(GrantSES-1021134)providedfundingforthe final revision and testing of the codebook, the process of coding and data entry,and theinitial process of data cleaning.Ialso owe thanks to faculty colleagues and graduate students who participated overtheyears in the Political Sociology,Collective Action and Social Movements Work-shop inStanford’'sDepartment ofSociology.I have subjected members of that work-shop to several presentations related to this book,ranging from the first draft of thegrant proposal to a series of draft chapters.I have benefited greatly from the reactionsof workshop participants to my preliminary drafts, and I owe special thanks to SusanOlzak, Doug McAdam, and Gi-Wook Shin, who have repeatedly provided fruitful suggestions and encouragement. I also owe a debt of thanks to members of Stanford's

263264ACKNOWLEDGMENTSChina Social ScienceWorkshop—in particularXueguang Zhou and Jean Oi—whopointed out serious flaws in an earlier version of one of the chapters. Qinglian Lu wasa creative co-author on an article on the diffusion of power seizures in early 1967, andI have included some of the observations from that article in Chapter 4.Iwas alsofortunate to collaborate with James Chu on an analysis of factional formation and es-calation processes, and some of these analyses have been incorporated into Chapter 7.Doug McAdam, Yang Su, and Shinichi Tanigawa provided detailed critical reviewsof this book's very different first draft,andI also benefited from detailed commentsby two reviewers for Harvard University Press, one of whom was Dingxin Zhao.Those who have read my co-authored publications with Dong Guoqiang of Shang-hai's Fudan University will recognize that some of the arguments that we have devel-oped during our long collaboration on the history of conflict in Jiangsu Province deeplyinform the analyses that I offer here.WhileI have not incorporated materialfrom ourpublicationsintothisbook,IfeelcompelledtoacknowledgemydebttoProfessorDong.This book expands on ideas presented in “Rebellion and Repression in China,1966-1971,”Socia/ScienceHistory38,3/4(Fall-Winter2014)CambridgeUniver-sity Press;“Rebellion of the Cadres: The 1967Implosion of the Chinese Party-StateThe China Journal 75 (January 2016),?
