# Notice from the Office of the CCP Central Party Rectification Work Guiding Committee Regarding the Prohibition against Destroying any Materials Produced in the “Cultural Revolution”

## Office of the CCP Central Party Rectification Work Guiding Committee (1984) No. 7

In view of the requirements of the work to rectify the party and to clear out the “Three Types of People,” any materials produced in different localities during the “Cultural Revolution” that have not already been sorted out should not be destroyed or dealt with at the moment. Only after the completion of party rectification can they be handled. At present we issue the following notice to address issues related to the safeguarding and the consultation of these materials:

1. Party groups across localities and departments must strengthen their management and carry out an earnest and conscientious sorting out of the materials from the “Cultural Revolution.” According to the regulations laid down in the documents Central Document (1979) No. 81, Central Organization Department Issue (1979) No. 54, and General Office Issue (1983) No. 3, materials belonging to those that should be filed in cadre archives, administrative archives, and archives of case files must be filed without delay; materials that are not to be placed in the archives are to be turned over to the party committee or group and to the personnel department of the relevant unit; the materials cannot be dispersed or lost. Individuals are not allowed to privately keep the examination materials of other people.

2. Materials from the “Cultural Revolution” were produced under particular historical circumstances and include a great deal of falsehoods; procedures for examination and authorization must be strictly implemented during consultation.1 Consultation of such materials by a given unit must obtain authorization from the comrade in charge of the unit’s party organization. An external unit that needs to consult materials that have already been filed away needs to go through the procedures for examination and authorization, as specified by the relevant regulations for consulting the archives; as for materials that have not been placed on file, the procedures for consulting administrative archives should be followed.

3. To make partial or complete copies of these materials, authorization is required from the comrade in charge of the party organization at the unit keeping the archival materials, a record must be made for each document, and in principle the use of the copies is restricted to the organization, the personnel department, or the party rectification office. Also, take care to maintain confidentiality.

4. On materials produced during the “clearing out” that followed the smashing of the “Gang of Four,” which record the circumstances within a given unit or in a given area during the “Cultural Revolution” or record the issues of certain people. None of these materials, or other materials that have not yet been sorted out, can be destroyed or filed away at the moment, with the exception of files that must be stored according to regulations. The responsibility to safeguard these materials falls on the given unit’s party organization or personnel department. When a given unit consults these materials, authorization is required from the comrade in charge of the unit’s party organization; when an external unit needs to consult [the materials], it must follow the procedures for examination and authorization as specified in the relevant regulations for consulting the archives.
