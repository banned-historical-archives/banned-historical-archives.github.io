# Some Regulations for Strengthening Public Security Work during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a big democratic movement under the command of Mao Zedong Thought and subjected to the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which has stirred the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses. The situation is excellent. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, it would not be possible to realize the Big Democracy of the popular masses. As one important tool of proletarian dictatorship, public security organs must take appropriate measures to strengthen dictatorship over the enemy; guarantee the democratic rights of the people; guarantee the normal advancement of the Big Airing of Views, Big Character Posters, Big Debates, and the Big Exchange; and guarantee the order of the proletarian revolution, all to meet the requirements of the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the following is stipulated:1. Active counterrevolutionaries—provided there is evidence of murder, arson, poisoning, robbery, murder by means of an arranged traffic accident, attack on a prison or an institution where criminals are held under control[1], illicit contacts with foreign countries, theft of state secrets, sabotage, and so on—must be punished according to the law.2. Mailing an anonymous counterrevolutionary letter, secretly or openly posting or distributing counterrevolutionary leaflets, writing reactionary slogans, shouting reactionary phrases, as well as attacking and slandering the Great Leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao are all acts of active counterrevolution that must be punished according to the law.3. Protect the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary mass organizations, protect the left-wing, ban violent struggle. All attacks on revolutionary mass organizations, all instances of beating and detaining members of the revolutionary masses are criminal acts. In general, party and state leaders and the revolutionary masses will carry out criticism and education. When it comes to the principal offenders behind the killing of members of the popular masses, enlisted thugs involved in serious cases, and behind-the-scenes manipulators, they must be punished according to the law.4. Landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, rightists; persons undergoing re-education through labor, and persons retained as employees at [correctional] farms (or factories) after the end of their sentence; back-bone elements of reactionary parties and organizations, leaders at the lower and middle rungs of reactionary sects and societies as well as preachers working for [such sects and societies]; enemy and puppet regime soldiers (company commanders and above), functionaries (ward heads and above),[2] police officers (superintendents and above), military police officers, and agents; elements released from re-education through labor upon completion of their sentences but who have not been successfully reformed; elements engaging in speculation and profiteering; relatives of counterrevolutionaries who have been killed, detained, placed under control, or fled abroad and who themselves stick to their reactionary standpoint, cannot be allowed to participate in the Big Exchange, change their names, alter their personal history, or infiltrate revolutionary mass organizations; they cannot be allowed to manipulate others or instigate trouble, and they most definitely cannot be allowed to establish their own organizations. If these elements commit acts of sabotage, they must be dealt with severely in accordance with the law.5. Anyone who uses Big Democracy or other means to disseminate counterrevolutionary discourse should as a rule be struggled against by the revolutionary masses. In serious cases, the public security departments must join forces with the revolutionary masses to conduct a timely investigation and, if necessary, may exercise their discretion to take such measures as the circumstances call for.6. Party, state, army, or public security personnel who distort the above regulations, manufacture facts, or suppress the revolutionary masses must be investigated and dealt with according to the law.

The above regulations must be propagated to the broad masses, and we must call on the revolutionary masses to aid and supervise public security organs in carrying out their duty, upholding the order of the revolution, and ensuring that public security personnel can carry out their regular duties.

These regulations can be posted broadly in cities and in the countryside.

Translation by Puck Engman[1] Translator’s note: Control (管制 guanzhi) was originally a sentence in which someone who had committed minor offences was placed under police supervision but remained in the community. Following the extension of the public security sector’s detention powers through the establishment of re-education through labor in 1956, control could also mean detainment in a facility for re-education through labor facility, which is the type of institution referred to here.

[2] Translator’s note: In the imperial baojia system revived by the Guomindang, a ward head (保长 baozhang) was responsible for security and order in a group (保 bao) of ten tithings (甲 jia) each of which was made up of ten households.
