Abstract

In 1871, during the Franco-Prussian War, the Parisian workers revolted againstthe bourgeois government and established the Paris Commune.Extolling it as the firstworkers’ government, classical Marxist writers took it as an exemplary—thoughembryonic—— model of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The principles of the ParisCommune, according to Marx, lay in that “the working class cannot simply lay holdof the ready-made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes." Generalelections and the abolishment of a standing armywereregarded by classical Marxistwriters as defining features of the organ of power established in the Paris CommuneAfter the defeat of theParis Commune, the Marxist interpretation of the Communewas widely propagated throughout the world, including in China.

20th century China has been rich with experiences of Commune-type theoriesand practices. At the end of 1966 and the beginning of 1967, inspired by the Maoisttheory of continuous revolution and the vision of a Commune-type state structure, therebel workers in Shanghai, together with rebellious students and revolutionary partycadresandleaders,tooktheboldinitiativetooverthrowtheoldpowerstructurefrombelow. On Feb.5, 1967, the Shanghai workers established the Shanghai Communemodeled upon the Paris Commune. This became known as the January Storm. AfterMao's death in 1976, the communist party and government in China has rewrittenhistory, attacking the Cultural Revolution.And the Shanghai Commune has barelybeen mentioned in China, let alone careful evaluation and in-depth study. This

ivdissertation attempts to recover this lost yet crucial history by exploring in historicaldetail the origin, development and supersession of theShanghai Commune.Examining the role of different mass organizations during the January Storm inShanghai, I attempt to offer a full picture of the Maoist mass movement based on thetheory of continuous revolution. Disagreeing with some critics’ arguments that theShanghai Commune was a negation of the party-state, I argue that it neither negatedthe party nor the state. Instead, the Shanghai Commune embodied the seeds of a novelstate structure that empowers the masses by relegating some of the state power tomass representatives and mass organs. Differing from the common narrative and mostscholarship in the post-Mao era, I argue that the commune movement in the beginningof 1967 facilitated revolutionary changes in Chinese society and state structure. TheShanghai Commune and the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee developed as rulingbodies that did not hold general elections or abolish the standing army and in this waydid not replicate the Paris Commune. But in contrast to the old Shanghai organs ofpower, they were largely in conformity with the principles of the Paris Commune bysmashing the Old and establishing the New.Some of their creativemeasures,“socialist new things", anticipated the features of a communal state -a state that doesnot eradicate class struggle yet begins to initiate the long process of the witheringawayof thestateitself.

IntroductionRecovering a Lost History: Unraveling the Shanghai Commune in 1967

On September 9, 1976, the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong passedaway. Within one month, a coup d'état took place on October 6, 1976, plotted by theacting prime minister Hua Guofeng, Marshal Ye Jianying, General Wang Dongxing.deputy prime minister Li Xiannian, and other high Party and army officials. Fourparty leaders who were followers of Mao - Jiang Qing (Madame Mao, member of theCCP Politburo), Zhang Chunqiao (deputy prime minister), Wang Hongwen(vice-chairman of the CCP), and Yao Wenyuan (member of the CCP Politburo) - werecalled to an alleged Politburo meeting and then arrested when they arrived. These founhigh party leaders were later denounced as the “Gang of Four." After this coup, thenew Hua Guofeng regime claimed allegiance to the Maoist revolutionary line in orderto legitimize the new administartion. But at the same time, it relentlessly persecutedCultural Revolution activists. But this contradictory policy of the Hua Guofengregime actually undermined its legitimacy and paved way to its self-destruction. Atthe time, no strong political force in Chinese society, either leftists or rightists, truelysupported this regime.And the rightist DengXiaoping and his followers werethereforeableto easilytake over statepower.

Eventually, while launching a large-scale campaign to “thoroughly negate theCultural Revolution", Deng Xiaoping forcefully dismantled all rural PeoplesCommunes, as he, together with Liu Shaoqi, had intended to in the wake of the GreatLeap Forward. The slight rise of the grain yield in the post-Mao Era was attributed tothe restoration of small-scale peasant farming which had lasted for more than onethousandyears and caused countless famines in Chinesehistory-not the theachievements during the Cultural Revolution such as thewater conservancy works.the basic farmland construction drives and projects (nongtian jiben jianshe), thebuilding of numerous fertilizer and pesticide plants, and the introduction of hybridrice crop (zajiao shuidao). Deng Xiaoping used state funds that had been accumulatedfor years during the MaoEra, to raise the workers'salaries.And then simultaneously.Deng publicly denounced the so-called “persecution" of the intellectuals by the “Gangof Four”’ and promised to rapidly raise their wages and social status. In order to caterto the intellectuals, the Deng regime purposely set up a "Teacher's Day” onSeptember 10", a day after Mao's death. One could say that, in a sense, this was afestival to celebrate Mao's death. For several years, it seemed that everybody lovedDeng Xiaoping. Consequently, Mao and the Cutural Revolution were disregarded bymany Chinese people, including quite a number of peasants and workers. The truehistory of the Cultural Revolution was meanwhile considerably blured, distorted andcoveredup.

Thisrecallshow today theFrenchworkers have ceased to commemorate theParis Commune. As Alain Badiou deplores, “little is remembered [about the ParisCommune]... Does the working class have a heart?" For about ten years after theCultural Revolution, similar questions were posed in post-Mao China as well. But thebourgeoisie has never been reluctant to grow their own gravediggers. Due to thedivision of land and individual farming (fen tian dan gan) promoted by the Dengregime, Chinese agriculture was soon mired in great difficulties. This resulted inburning and lasting "sannong” issues, namely, rural problems pertaining to agriculture.the villages, and the peasants. The need to address these rural issues is in part behind

2why at the end of 2009 the Chineseregimelegalized and promoted the mass-scalegrowth of genetically engineered rice, corn and soybeans offered by the US basedchemical company Monsanto—regardless of its uncertainty to human health. TheChinese netizens' resistance to genetically engineered crops was powerful. And thefinal outcome of this resistance is still to come. Compared with the peasants, theChinese workers'fate was even worse after 1992when many of them werelaid off bystate-run enterprises. As the urban workers'plight has increasingly deteriorated, therehave been many so-called“collective incidents"(qunti shijian) among workingpeople. For instance, on July 22,2009, thousands of angry steelworkers of theTonghua Steel Factory in Jilin Province, who faced the prospect of being fired, rushedto the general manager, Chen Guojun, and beat him to death. This could be seen as awatershed event for the Chinese workers’struggle. And rounds of "Mao Zedongfever", like the waves of an endlessly rising tide, have surged through the streets andvillages in China in the first years of the 21st century. Many workers and peasants arelooking forward to a new Cultural Revolution to get rid of corrupt officials.Consequently, in recent years, there has been a powerful trend among the grass-rootspeople and non-mainstream, namely, non-neo-liberal intellectuals to re-evaluate theCultural Revolution by challenging the official verdict of the CR, and recovering thelosthistoryoftheCR.

In doing research on the Cultural Revolution one has to confront the direreality in China over the past 30 years. And a number of important questions come up:What really was the experience of the masses of Chinese people during the CulturalRevolution? How do the common people who experienced the CR—-not theelite—look back and reflect upon this historical period?Why and to what degree arethe interpretations of the CR meaningful in understanding contemporary Chinese

3reality and reenvisioning the future of China?In some sense,the process of answeringthese questions about the CR is a process of recovering a lost, or, a suppressed history.The increasingly intensified struggle of the Chinese working people has made mefocus my study of the CR on the mass movements, especially workers’ movements.And the most important, yet least explored workers’ movements during the CR tookplace in Shanghai. Therefore, written from a political and historical point of view, mydissertation is a close examination of the CR in Shanghai from 1966 and 1967. 1explore this eventful period against the backdrop of the masses? collective activities,including those of the workers, students, intellectuals, and peasants, bothconservatives and rebels. The rise and supersession of the Shanghai Commune duringthe CR, a unique local state power organ created by the Shanghai masses modeledupon the Paris Commune, will be my central focus. So far, mainstream scholarship onthe CR has mainly focused on either political power struggles among top leaders inBeijing, or the student movements (existing studies are mainly on Red Guards inBeijing, Guangzhou and Wuhan).Different from these studies, my project focuses onthe workers’ movement and the role of mass political participation in the shaping andformation of the Shanghai Commune. I will explore the political activism of leadersof mass organizations as well as of ordinary workers and citizens, many of whom infact held different political viewpoints while declaring allegiance to the same bannerofMaoZedongThought

The short-lived Shanghai Commune lasted only 20 days, and was thenreplaced by a Three-in-One Combination leadership. Yet for several importantthinkers such as Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek, and some scholars such as Henry C.

4Topper,* it represents the political apogee of the CR. How should we evaluate andinterpret this seminal event?Also, although there have been some studies on the CRin Shanghai, there have been few in-depth studies on the Shanghai Commune itself.The climax of the CR,whether acclaimed or condemned,has still been kept silent inthe dark shadow of history. As the product of grass-roots workers’mass movementsaimed at promoting democratic participation and exercising proletarian leadership, theShanghai Commune contributed greatly to the political practice and theory of theworking class. In order to bring to light the voices, passions, and dreams of thesilenced masses, my project endeavors to provide a much fuller picture of theShanghai Commune, so that an alternative understanding of the CR can be effected.

Marx claimed that “after every [previous bourgeois] revolution marking aprogressive phase in the class struggle,thepurely repressive character of the statepower stands out in bolder and bolder relief,*2 “All revolutions thus only perfectedthe State machinery instead of throwing off this deadening incubus."'3 But Marx andEngels saw in theParis Commune the seeds of developing a novel form of societythat is, the gradual “withering of the state". The Commune was “the political form ofthe social emancipation, of the liberation of labor from the usurpations (slaveholding)of themonopolists of themeansoflabor,createdbythelaborers themselves orforming the gift of nature."4 The Commune, therefore, is a tool for liberating laborfrom capital, for liberating the society from the oppressive state. Marx and Engels1 I will discuss Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek's such evaluation of the Shanghai Commune in the first chapter.Also see Henry C.Topper's dissertation,From the Commune to the Cultural Revolution: A Discussion of PartyLeadership andDemocracy inLenin and Mao,Baltimore:theJohnHopkinsUniversity,1990,p.265.2Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France, in MECW, Volume 22.p.329.3Ibid.p.484.4Ibid.p.490.

5evaluation may be partially applicable to the Shanghai Commune, and its substitutiveShanghai Revolutionary Committee. On the one hand, the new Shanghai power organthat emerged from the CR did exert controlling measures toward dissents andoppositions among the masses, thus keeping distance from the prototype structure ofthe Paris Commune. On the other hand, greatly inspired by the Paris Commune, itadopted many measures to expand mass democracy, to further advance the continuousrevolution, and to some significant extent, to usher in the beginning of the witheringaway of the oppressive characters of state power. My dissertation examines theprecious experiences and lessons of Shanghai Commune and its substitutive ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee in comparison with those of the Paris Commune.

The first chapter, “The Paris Commune Goes to China: Historical Contour andScholarship of the Shanghai Commune", sets the historical stage of the ShanghaiCommune in a long-term perspective. I briefly reiterate the history of the ParisCommune through the account of a Chinese eye-witness. I then trace the obliterationof theParis Commune by the French state machinery and the commemoration of theParis Commune by various revolutionary forces. I touch on the introduction of theParis Commune into China, first mainly from France, then largely through the eventsinRussia.ItwastheRussianBolshevikRevolution thatenabledtheChineserevolutionaries tolook toward the model of theParis Commune and set out to practiceCommune power organs in China. In 1927, Chinese revolutionaries twice set upCommune power organs in two major cities—Shanghai and Guangzhou, thoughunfortunately, they were brutally demolished by the bourgeois Nationalist troops. The

6third urban Commune power organ, the focus of my project, appeared in Shanghai inthe heat of the Cultural Revolution. In this chapter, I will mainly cover the Chineseand Western scholarship on the Shanghai Commune and thinking on the concept ofcommunes in the Mao Era. I will first introduce two memoirs written by foreignobservers: Neal Hunter's Shanghai Journal, and Sophia Knight's Window onShanghai:Lettersfrom China.What they saw and heard before or during theShanghai January Revolution provided us with precious materials on the ShanghaiCommune. Then I will comment on the early Western scholarship on the Shanghaicommune.In1971,to commemorate thecentennial of theParis Commune,twoChinaspecialists in the U.S., Maurice Meisner and John Bryan Starr, reflected on therelationshipbetween theParis Commune and the thinking and practice of theCommune in China, especially the Shanghai Commune. Although their path-breakingwork is inspiring,I argue that some of their viewpoints warrant further scrutiny. Afterthat, I will examine the post-Mao Chinese scholarships aiming at negating theShanghai commune. Specifically, I will examine works of Gao Fang, Jin Chunming.Yan Jiaqi and Wang Nianyi, which serve the ideological aims of the pro-capitalistChinese regime to demonize the CR and the Shanghai Commune. And then I will dealwith the Marxist elegies to the Shanghai Commune in the West after the 1976 coupd'état. Their representative evaluations, namely, those of Charles Bettelheim, SamMarcy and the Progressive Labor Party, will be explored. Furthermore, I will probeintotheworksoftwoChinascholarsintheWest—AndrewWalder andElizabethPerry after the CR. In addition, I will discuss Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek's

7rethinking of themeaningof revolutionin relationship to thelessons of theShanghaiCommune. Finally, I will deal with the recent Chinese reappraisals of the ShanghaiCommune, from both anti-CR and pro-CR parties

As the Marxist theories of the state are crucial in understanding Maoistsimagination and construction of“a wholly new form of state structure"in the storm ofthe CR, the second chapter "Lessons of the Paris Commune: Classical Marxist Writerson theState"proceeds to examine the classical Marxist thinking about theParisCommune by Marx, Engels, and Lenin. Focusing on their theories of the statesummarized from the lessons of the Paris Commune, I will explore why in theMarxist tradition the Paris Commune was seen as a form of the “dictatorship of theproletariat". I will argue that this kind of dictatorship of the Proletariat of the ParisCommune should be considered an embryonic one. Furthermore, I will argue that inthe Marxist tradition the Paris Commune was usually treated as a negation of theprevious states, especially the feudal and the bourgeois states,but an upholding of theproletarian state.TheParis Commune endeavored to construct a communal statebasedonacommunalconstitution.Asitdiscardedthemajorevilsofpreviousstateforms, such as the standing army and the military bureaucracy, the communal statewould be just a semi-state and an anti-state state, namely, a state of initiating thewithering away of the state itself. Then I proceed to an analysis of why Marx claimedthat the commune [state] would not do away with class struggle. The class strugglewould not be completed even with the establishment of the Commune state. I willdiscuss the possible elements contributing to the class struggle and forms of class

8struggle in a commune state. The destiny of a communal state, I argue, would hingeon the class struggle between the global proletariat and the global bourgeoisie. In thissense,thecommunalstateisorientedtowardthefutureandtowardaworldrevolutionThis may be regarded as the Marxist theoretical foundation of the Maoist theory ofcontinuousrevolutionunderthedictatorshipoftheproletariat

The third chapter “Envisioning a Wholly New Form of State Structure” dealswith the ideological preparations of the Maoist thinkers for the formation of theShanghai Commune. I start by tracing the formation of Mao's theory of continuousrevolution by following the two-line struggle within the CCP, with a focus on thecommunization movement and the Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s. Theresistance against the collectivization of agriculture within the CCP, I will argue, wasan important factor that led to Mao advocating continuous revolution. I will thenexamine the debate around “bourgeois right" from 1958 to 1962, in which ZhangChunqiao,whobecameoneofMao'sclosest associates,drewon thelessons of theParis Commune to envision a future society. Furthermore, I will examine ZhangZhisi's article in commemoration of the 95"h anniversary of theParis Commune in1966. In this editorial, Zheng Zhisi explained why the Paris Commune was stillrelevant andworthy of commemoration.After thelaunch of theCR,Maohailed awall poster at Beijing University as “the declaration of the Chinese Paris Commune".Witha close reading of this poster, I discuss the relationship between the massmovement and thetheory of continuousrevolution.The dynamicsof thecontinuousrevolution lay in the staging of mass movements, which were seen by Mao as an ideal

9way of waging class struggle against the bourgeoisie in and outside the Party. I thendiscuss the vital document of the CR, The Sixteen Points,in which the Party officiallycalledfor looking to theParis Commune as a modelin creating awholly newform ofstatestructure.Attheendof this chapter,Idiscuss another crucialeditorialoftheRedflag, in which the Paris Commune-type general election was considered a keymeasure torestore and defend the dictatorship of theproletariat, and to create awhollynewformofstatestructure.

The fourth chapter “The Road to Shanghai Revolutionary Revolution" and thefifth chapter"The Rise of the Shanghai Commune" trace the brief yet complex, courseof events leading to the formation of the Shanghai Commune. Under the banner of"All power to the Shanghai Commune", it was a product of unprecedented massinitiatives driven by discontent over the pre-CR order and the old power holderssuppression of the rebel movement in the early stage of the CR. The Commune wasalso inspired by a call from the Maoist leadership and by the ideals of revolution anddemocracy modeled after theParis Commune.This movementinvolved fiercestruggles, both physically and ideologically, and constant negotiations andcompromises among various mass organizations and their leaders. Focusing on theseizure of power by the rebels,I discuss how the rebel workers in Shanghaiunderstood the Paris Commune model and the organizational forms they created inthe January Storm. I also discuss the problems and difficulties enountered by theShanghai Commune by looking at the formation of rival workers’ organizations, thespate of economism, the democratic experiment of self-governance of workers in the

10factory, the dual power in the January storm, and the internecine struggles. The fifthchapter ends with a discussion of whether or not the Shanghai Commune, as somecritics such as Alain Badiou and Slavoj Zizek have argued, was an antithesis to thestate. I argue that it did involve a utopian moment that kept a distance from the state.but this was mainly put forward by a minority of rebels. And almost nobody in theShanghai Commune proposed to abolish the standing army, the police, and the PartyNevertheless, the Shanghai Commune valued the basic principles of the ParisCommune and followed its spirit.

Chapter Six “Revolutionary Committee is Good"': The Supersession of theShanghai Commune” examines the considerations that led the Maoist leadership toreplace the Shanghai Commune with the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Iprovide evidence that there were strong,hostile opposition forces in the rebel ranks tothe Shanghai Commune. One of the most important reasons, I argue, came from themighty resistance of the high ranking leaders in theParty and the army. Another majonreasonfor replacing the Commune was that Maobelieved that theParty should not beabolished at that time.The Maoists thought that the failure of Paris Commune wasmainly due to thelack of strong partyleadership.One of the actual products of the CRis that the Party lost its control over the masses, who were then offered multipleopportunities for political emancipation. But should the party be abolished? Mao'sanswer would be no. In this chapter, I offer Mao's own explanations for replacing theShanghai Commune. I end this chapter with an examination of the staging of theShanghai Revolutionary Committee, delving into whether there were marked

11differences between theShanghai Commune and theShanghai RevolutionaryCommittee. During the period of forming RCs throughout China, there was strongopposition from the ultra-leftist Red Guards, represented by Yang Xiaokai, to thereplacement of the Shanghai Commune. These forces, who hated the RevolutionaryCommittees favored by Mao, envisioned a People's Commune of China. It is temptingto discuss their position. But given the limitations of this disseration, I will leave theultra-leftists'roadmap to a communal statefor later exploration.

In the Conclusion,I reaffirm that the Chinese Commune movement in 1967 wasan unprecedented and far-reaching revolution that changed the face of China, not afarce as some people have depicted. I also outline the fate of the major players in theShanghai Commune after the coup d'état in 1976. More attention is given to the issueof how to prevent a socialist society from capitalist restoration and whether there is afuture for the Paris Commune in China. If there exists a possibility for the revival ofthe commune spirit/ model in China, what should the revolutionaries learn from thelessons of the Paris Commune and the Shanghai Commune? Following this vein, Idiscuss a possible Maoist roadmap to extensive democracy within the philosophicalframework of the dialectics of party and mass organizations. Having drawn thelessons of the Shanghai Commune and the CR, I propose a tentative model: the massorganizations, instead of being weakened, should be consolidated as necessarycomplements to the party, while the two should maintain a dialectical relationshipThat is to say, the pro-communist mass organizations are politically, notorganizationally, under the leadership of the revolutionary party, yet maintain their

12owninitiativesandsubstantial autonomy.Therefore,themassorganizationsfunctionas the supervision over the party, while the party can get rid of the stale and take inthe fresh from the mass organizations, thus always sustaining new dynamics andcontinuing the revolution. I argue that one of the main things that contributed to thefailure of mass organizations is the dissolution of strong organizational structures andtheloss of clear organizationalidentities.But I reaffirm that no organizational formsand institutional forms can guarantee that a society will move toward socialism andcommunism.Nevertheless,avaluablelessondrawnfromthefailureofthefirstwaveof the socialist and communist experiments is that after a successful working people'spower seizure of the state, as long as there is no major threat from the enemies of theworking people, the proletariat should immediately initiate the long, difficult andcomplicated process of the“withering away of the state".Any advocates of theworkingpeople'srevolutioninthefutureshouldhaveaclearsense about theimminent oppressive characters of the state, especially its worst aspects, as Engelssuggests,“the victorious proletariat,just like the Commune,cannot avoid having totop off at once as much as possible until such time as a generation reared in new, freesocial conditions is able to throw the entire lumber of the state on the scrap heap."5 Iconclude this dissertation by stating that as long as labor is not completely liberatedfrom capital, as long as the big differences between the privileged and theunderprivileged are not largely leveled, the Commune could be an enduring point ofreference and an eternal return for the working people's emancipation5 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, p.34.

The Suppression of Cultural Revolution Activists and Burningof Cultural Revolution Books:Difficulties of Studying the Cultural

Revolution

Immediately after the 1976 coup, a large-scale movement to uncover, criticizeand investigate the “crimes" of the “Gang of Four” and their followers (jiepichayundong) swept across China from 1976 to 1977. The leaders of the coup instigatedthe people to strike against the supporters of the “Gang of Four” just as they hadstruck against the Japanese devils (intruders) (riben guizi) and Guomindang troops.Awave of terror reigned throughout China. Almost all Maoist rebels, possibly reachingtens of millions, were apprehended and ruthlessly persecuted. Take Zhejiang provincefor example. Between 1976 and 1980, all the representatives at various leadershiplevels, no matter from the masses, the army, or the veteran Party cadre rank, as well asthe grassroots activists in the production teams of villages, were under harshexaminationandtargeted.Altogether,persecutedCRactivistsinZhejiangreachedmore than four million. In Taizhou region, just within the governmental agencies, 2people were shot, 11 committed suicide, 23 were condemned tovarious terms ofimprisonment, 50 were expelled from the CCP, and 3,200 teachers were dismissedfrom their teaching positions. As for other forms of persecutions, there is no way tocount the victims.InLinhai County,20 CR activists committed suicide, and 40 were

14condemned to various terms of imprisonment.In Huangyan County, 20 CR activistscommitted suicide, 37were condemned tovarious terms ofimprisonment, and 1 wassentenced to death with a reprieve. In Xianju County, 22 CR activists committedsuicide,and38wereconvictedforcrimesof"counter-revolution".Andeveninthesmall island of Yuhuan County, 4 CR activists committed suicide, 39 were condemnedto various terms of imprisonment, and 44 were held in custody for a period of timeand then expelled from the Party and their jobs. From 1976 to 1979, in the Jinhuaregion of Zhejiang,662 CR activists were convicted for“crimes”of"counter-revolution", more than 190 activists committed suicide, and 4 people weresentenced to death. In the Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, of less than 2,0o0 people.three committed suicide, one person was driven to insane, 3 were condemned tovarious terms of imprisonment, and 38 were held in private prisons.

After the coup, in the remote border province, Yunnan, 1.5 million CRactivists were struggled against, one hundred fifty thousand were subjected toPartyand political disciplinary sanctions, and more than fifty thousand were arrested andcondemned to various terms of imprisonment or “re-education" through labor. Amongthemtherewere7,594upper-middlePartyor armycadres,whoseadministrativerankswere equivalent to, or above, a county administration, or a regiment in the military.6Li Xiantong,A Report Concerning the Construction of Harmonious Society and Calling for Reversals ofGrievances,Falsifications,andMistakes(Guanyugoujianhexieshehuipingfanyuanjiacuo'andebaogao).Thisisa former rebel leader Li Xiantong's letter to Zhejiang Party secretary Zhao Hongzhu to call for redress of his caseof grievance,and naturally,Li got no positive response from the current power holders.Seehttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=12317,cited onDec.25,2009.In the Jingdong county of Yun'nan Province,more than 3,100 activists were struggled against, more than 1,000were injured or maimed from beatings, more than 1,000 cadres were dismissed, 125 cadres were arrested, 53persons were officially condemned to various terms of imprisonment, 4 were beaten to death on the spot at themass struggle rallies, and 9 were barbarously tortured to death.At the Simao town with a population of less than20 thousand,103 residents were apprehended,52 were condemned to various terms of imprisonment, and 8 wereforced tocommit suicide.YangXiujie,aveteranPLA officer,whomadegreat contributions in theWar ofLiberation,was shot inSeptember 19,1978for his“crimes of counter-revolution”during the CR.After his

ToachievedramaticimpactinthemovementtosuppresstheCRrebels,caseswere brought against many so-called"little Gang of Four”groups, symbolicallyconsistingofthreelocalmalerebelleadersandonefemaleleader.Thiswasdonetomimic the “Gang of Four” in Beijing that consisted of three men, Wang Hongwen,Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, and one woman, Jiang Qing.° In numerous cases,after mass rallies, some “little Gang of Four” groups were paraded around undermilitary escort to the execution grounds and shot. The propaganda machine controlledby those who held power after Mao's death depicted the Chinese economy under theinfluence of "Gang of Four” and Mao during the CR as disastrous and as on the brinkof collapse.And it claimed that the masses hated the “Gang of Four"so much thatwhen they heard that the “Gang of Four" had been smashed, they were so excited asto purchase crabs in the markets to cook a dish called the “Gang of Four",in whichthere werefour crabs,three males and onefemale.”There is great ironyhere becauseobviously,crabswereanexpensiveandluxuriousfoodforthecommonChinesepeople. So if the Chinese economy under Mao was really on the brink of collapseexecution, the local authority even forbade anybody to collect his corpse, resulting in the loss of his remains. LiuShaozu,anotherveteranPLA officer andlater a cadre of theKunmingRailwayBureau,afterbeingreleased after 7years’imprisonment due to his rebel activity during the CR,starved to death at home due to unemployment.It wasonlybecause of the bad smellfromhis dead body that his neighbors discovered his body and were shocked tofindthat he had been dead for more than a week.

Putting activists from the Cultural Revotuion on trial, in effect meant puttingall things related to the CR, and the CR itself, on trial as well. Thousands of Maostatues erected during the CR were demolished or buried underground, usuallysecretly late at night, without any public discussion. Model operas and films producedduring the CR were banned.1° CR books and materials suffered a similar fate. OnJanuary 6, 1977, the Hua Guofeng regime issued an order to burn all books associatedwith the so-called “Gang of Four" and their followers."" Aiming to erase thehistorical traces of that era,this order detailedvarious restrictions about publicationsrelated to the CR. Almost all important theoretical, historical, political books andmodel opera publications during the CR, as a result, fell into the category of thingsthat were to be destroyed.1? A wave of burning CR books and materials surged acrossChina. Shanghai, the so-called "severely afflicted area" (zhongzaiqu) of the CR, bore10 In recent years, only a few selected model operas have been allowed to be performed due to their de factotremendouscommercialvalue.ApprovedbytheStateCouncil:ProposalByTheStatePublicationsBureauLeadingGroupAboutTheHandlingofBooksInvolvingthe“GangOfFour"Anti-PartyClique(guowuyuanpizhunguojiahubanjulingdaoxiaozuguanyu sheji“sirenbang”fandang jituan tushu chuli gongzuo deqingshi baogao),PublicationsBureauLeadingGroup Character[chulingzi]No,007.See Liu Gao and Shi Feng ed.,Chronicle of Publication in the50Years ofNewChina(Xinzhongguowushinian chuban jishi),Xinhua chubanshe,1999,p.164.12 For instance, all books that included articles composed by the writing groups who were supposedly “controlled"by the"Gang of Four", such as Liao Xiao (the Mass Criticism Groups of Peking and Tsinghua Universities), QingHuaiwen,Chi Heng,ChengYue,Chu Lan,Jiang Tian,LuoSiding,each of which consisted of a fewradicalintellectuals,were ordered bannedfrom circulation.Furthermore,the articles written by these authors,but underother pen names,were to be carefullyidentified and obliterated.What's more,the circulation of all books thatincluded articles and images of the supposed followers of the so-called "Gang of Four", such as model opera actorsHao Liang and Liu Qingtang, and senior diplomat Qiao Guanhua, was to be ceased as well.

17the brunt of this campaign of destruction.A librarian at FudanUniversityinShanghaivividlyrecalled:

In the spring of 1977, there was an order to dispose of all CR materials.Common work-unitshad to turn in and destroy their collection....Onthat day the trucks from the paper factory parked outside the Fudanlibrary building. From 9:00 am to 3:00 pm,bag by bag, we were busywith throwingCR books and materials out of thebuilding's windows.Whentwothirdsofthelibrary'scollectionoftheCRmaterialswerefinished, we felt hungry.... we were really unwilling to do it as we feltthat these materials were of value and deserved to be kept. Then, Iwaved myhands downward to the people outside to show that allmaterials were finished. In this way, we kept one third of Fudan's CRcollection.I should say that two thirds of thelibrary's CR materialswere thrown out through my hands. The day before yesterday I met myold colleague of Fudan library and mentioned this. He said that “onthat day you threw the materials from above, and I collected what youthrew down below. After the trucks of the paper factory drove away, onthe ground there was scattered a pile of CR materials and we had toburn them ourselves. [The remaining papers were so thick and heavythat] in order to keep the fire burning, we had to constantly stir thepaper pile with iron bars.**13

In addition to CR books and materials, the institutions created during the CRespecially the revolutionary committees, also fell into the category of things to besmashed. Although the name of the revolutionary committee was retained for a whileafter the CR, its substance totally changed as rebel representatives were expelled,jailed, or even shot. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, as the successor of theShanghai Commune, was finally dismantled in 1979. The Chinese dream of the ParisCommune that had inspired the Chinese imagination for nearly 100 years, wasconsiderably dimmed in “a foul wind and a rain of blood' and exiled to the murky13Jing Dalu,Where is Fudan's CRMaterials？-An Interview with Cao Chong and QingBanglian(Fudan dewengeziliaodao nali qu le—CaoChongQingBanglianfangtanji),Historical Review(Shilin),SupplementNo.1,2006,p.108

18margins, as Mao himself predicted at his sickbed during his last year.14

In the early 1980s, the Deng Xiaoping regime went much further than the HuaGuofeng regime by launching a big campaign to “thoroughly negate the CulturalRevolution", successfully demonizing the CR and its' leaders, including Mao ZedongDeng Xiaoping himself evaluated the whole life of Mao as meriting only "san qi kai'(a thirty-seventy split, meaning thirty percent failure or shortcomings and seventypercent success). But the state propaganda machine controlled by the elite officialsand intellectuals actually went muchfurther than that, hinting that Mao was actuallyseventy percent bad and merely thirty percent good (qi san kai, or dao san qi kai)Excluding Mao's military achievements in founding the PRC, almost all of Mao'saccomplishments were depicted as disasters, especially in the years after 1956 whenthe agricultural collectivization movement was carried out. Through manipulatingpopulation statistics and distorting the history of the Great Leap Forward, DengXiaoping and his heirs successfully denigraded Mao in “academic" publications -claiming an astonishing death toll of at least several dozen million in the so-calledGreat Leap Forward famine. Rumors about Maoist rebels and a barrage of "scarliterature”that exaggerated the sufferings of mainly officials and intellectuals, weredisseminated through tabloids,Party newspapers, films,books, among other venuesAll this effectively portrayed the CR as an unprecedented criminal holocaust of14 Mao had a conversation with Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao,Jiang Qing, Hua Guofeng, Wu De, and WangHairong on 15 June (possibly 13 January)1976, in which he said: "The Great Cultural Revolution is somethingthat has not yet been concluded. Thus I am passing the task on to the next generation.I may not be able to pass iton peacefully,in which caseI may have to pass it on in turmoil. What will happen to the next generation if it allfails? There may be a foul wind and a rain of blood. How will you cope? Heaven only knows!" See Mao Zedong,"SealtheCoffinandPass theFinalVerdict",inSchoenhals,Michaeled.,China'sCulturalRevolution,1966-1969:Not ADinnerParty,M.E.Sharpe,1996,p.293.

19economicdisruption,irrationalviolence,masskillings,thedestruction of traditioninsanity, and so forth. Liberal intellectuals and officials in the mass media even hintedat - or openly put forward - a portrayal of Mao as a “Hitler in the East".Correspondingly, the rural People's Communes were demonized by a popular liberalhistorian in Qinghua University as Auschwitz-style “concentration camps".15 Duringthe past 30years,people have been ceaselessly bombarded through various venues bythe warning that one should never allow the “tragedy"of the CR to reappear in thefuture.

MyUseof Materials

Due to strict censorship, academic studies of the Cultural Revolution in Chinacan only follow the official verdict of the CR set by Deng Xiaoping. In fact, up untilnow,research on the CR for scholars outside the party establishment was stillconsidered a ^forbidden city". For more than 30 years, only scholars authorized by thegovernment such as Yan Jiaqi, Jin Chunming, Wang Nianyi, Jin Chongji, and PangXianzhi could publish their writings. And these writings of course, do not contradictthe official verdict on the CR and Mao. The publication of writings about the CR thatdiverge from the official propaganda has not been allowed. And even if someonemanaged to get past strict government sensorship or self censorship imposed byeditors and journalists, they would encounter fierce attacks by the mainstream15QinHuiTheReformfChneeLandSystemattheCrosroad Shizilukudehongutudizidugaige)Nanfangdushibao(SouthernMetroDaily),October7,2008

20Chinese academia.1° Due to the regime's hostility, many crucial historical materialsabout the CR have been out of public reach - though now, more and more documentshave become available through various channels. Even vendors of the CR tabloids inthe flea markets are often harassed and punished with arbitrary fines. Furthermorealmost all internet websites in Chinese dedicated to the study of the CR, regardless oftheir political views, have been blocked or shut down by the Chinese government. Forscholars outside China,even though they have more freedom to study the CR, one ofthe biggest difficulties is still the lack of materials, especially firsthand historicaldocuments and personal narratives. These resources are either locked up, or have beendestroyed by the regime. And it has also been very hard to interview key figures whoexperienced andwitnessed theCR,or toinvestigatesites of keyevents during the CRI visited Shanghai in 2006 in the hope of investigating some historical sites of the CRWhen I took some photograhps of the old city hall, I was immediately held by thesecurity guards, threatened and subjected to interrogation. They destroyed the film inmy camera and recorded my identity card. WhenI tried to arrange interviews withsome key CR figures there, I was told that they were under close governmentalsupervision. Even if I managed to interview them, the interviewees had to tell thegovernmentwhotheyhadmetwith

As a result of these difficulties, I had to base my research of the ShanghaiCommune mainly on currently available resources written during and after the CR16 For example, in 2001, when a famous intellectual journal -“Reading"(dushu) published an article praisingtheCRatthevillagelevelbyGaoMobo(anAustralianChinesescholar),theauthorGaoandthechiefeditor of dushu Wang Hui suffered fierce attacks from Chinese liberals. See Gao Mobo, Writing History:Gao Village, in dushu, 2001, No.1. For an example of the liberal criticism of Gao's article, see Xu Youyu, DangGuoying and Jiao Guobiao's comments on Nanfang Weekend (nanfang zhoumo),March, 29,2001.

21Though there were many books and materials on the general studies of the CR, it wasnot easy to get useful information on theShanghai Commune.In order toreconstructthe history of the Shanghai Commune, I tried my best to gather every single piece ofhistorical evidence related to this topic. This process took me several years. Theprimary sources of this dissertation can roughly be divided into the followingcategories:

First: official publications during the CR. I used a lot of information takenfrom thePeople'sDaily(renmin ribao),Red Flag(hongqi),New ChinaNewsAgency(Xinhuashe), and the CCP's English weekly journal Peking Review. To use the Centralorgans’ articles was of crucial importance in exploring the official policies andattitudes toward the contemporary issues during the CR. For example, some scholarstook the view that during the whole process of the Shanghai Commune, before it wasceplaced by the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, the CCP had never officiallyacknowledged the Shanghai rebel's provisional government. But in fact, the People'sDaily released an article on February 17 1967 covering and praising the“All-cityProvisional Supreme Power Organ of Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels", though it didnotmentionthenameof theShanghaiCommune.Thispieceof newsfrom thegovernment effectively showed Maoist leadership's acknowledgment of thelegitimacy and authority of the Shanghai Commune, even though it did not apparentlyagreewiththeCommune'stitle.

The second group of materials that I utilized in my project was the Chinesepublications after the CR.As we know,books and articles that deviated too much

22from theCCP's officialverdicts about theCRwerenotpublished in thePeople'sRepublic of China.Therefore,authorized publications about the CR were naturallyone-sided, sometimes nothing more than the footnote of the Chinese regimes’ officialverdicts.Nevertheless, some of them still contain many historical facts.For examplein reconstructing the history of the Shanghai CR, I draw on some historical detailsfrom thefirstParty secretary of theSPC ChenPixian'sbook,AttheCenter of theJanuaryStorm(ChenPixianhuiyilu:zaiyiyuefengbaodezhongxin),eventhoughsome of Chen's recollections are fictitious. Due to the harsh restrictions imposed bythe Chinese regime on the publication of the CR related books in China, after the CRsome CR memoirs were published in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Most of them, such asWangLifansilu(WangLi'sReflections)andChenBodazuihoukoushuhuiyi(FinalOral Memoirs of ChenBoda),take an anti-CR stance,but contain someusefulinformation. Similarly, the memoir by the Shanghai literati rebel leader Xu JingxianTen Years A Dream (Shi nian yi meng), published in Hong Kong in 2003,helped metoreiteratethestoryof theShanghaiCommune

The third and the most pertinent materials that I frequently used were theactual CR Red Guard and rebel tabloids and newspapers,leaflets,and pamphlets,which I have personally collected for years. In this dissertation, I mainly made use ofthe following Red Guard and rebel materials: Workers'Rebel News (gongren zaofanbao),TheJanurary Stom (yiyue fengbao) et al.produced by theWGH; Jiefang ribao(LiberationDaily),WenhuiBao(WenhuiDaily),ShanghaiWanbao(ShanghaiEveningNews),and Zhibu Shenghuo(LifeinPartyBranches)inShanghai rebels

23control;TheChronicleoftheShanghaiJanuaryRevolution(Shanghaiyiyuegemingdashiji) compiled by the Writing Group of Revolutionary Mass Criticism in Shanghai;therebelpamphletAnnalsof OpposingtheEconomisminShanghaiDuringtheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution,Nov.1966-March15,1967(Wuchanjiejiwenhua dagemingzhongShanghaifandui jingji zhuyi dashiji,1966.11-1967.3.15) compiled bythe Liaison General Headquarters of Opposing the Economism; numerous rebelpamphlets compiled by The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Centre of Organizations ofthe Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and materials compiled by various BeijingRed Guard factions stationed in Shanghai and local Shanghai Red Guard groups, suchas“Frontline News”(huoxian bao),edited by the Revolutionary Rebels'Committeeof Shanghai Institute of Machinery. However, it is very hard to obtain publications ofthe conservative factions and the anti-WGH, anti-Shanghai Commune rebel dissentsfactions. This is a big problem. In order to make up for such a shortcoming, I tried toincorporate some materials that came out after the CR from the perspectives of formerconservatives orrebeldissents,suchasGengJinzhang'sinterview,AnWenjiang'srecollection,andsomeformermembersoftheScarletGuards'memoirs

Becauseofthegovernment'sruthlessrestrictionofmemoirsbyformerrebelsmany rebels have posted their recollections online. This is the fourth and an importantprimary source used to write this disseration. To some extent, they partly offset mylack of first-hand interviews of the ex-activists of the Shanghai CR. In the first, fourthandfifth chapters of my dissertation, I used the recollections of CaoWeiping, who is aformer Red Guard of the Fudan University and now a famous internet activist. In

24addition,I made use of many interviews available online, such as those of PanGuoping, the first commander of the WGH. In fact, many of the online sources Imanaged to find were originally posted on the Chinese Cultural Revolution ResearchNet (zhongguo wenge yanjiu wan. The URL is http://www.wengewang.org). This is aprofessional Chinese/Englishbilingualwebsitedevoted to studies of the CR

It is not surprising that I quote a great deal of Mao's works in order to illustratehis views of continuous revolution,his imagination of a wholly newform of statestructure, and his justification of the nominal shift of the Shanghai Commune, and soforth.Unfortunately,TheCompleteCollectedWorksof MaoZedongwas neverpublished. After the coup d'état in 1976, in order to show its "loyalty" to Mao's linebut disregarding Mao's own wish to be cremated after death, the Hua Guofeng regimeconstructed a Mao mausoleum in the Tian'anmen Square. In addition, the Hua regimeannouncedaplantocompile andpublishTheCompleteCollectedWorksofMaoZedong. But the Hua regime was soon toppled by Deng Xiaoping and his lieutenants,who launched a sweeping anti-Mao movement, ideologically, institutionally andorganizationally. Therefore,the compilation and release of the CompleteCollectedWorks of Mao Zedong was permanently postponed. Instead, the Deng and post-DengChinese regimes, which insisted on Deng's line without Deng, only published someselected works of Mao,whichincludedseveral articles written by Mao during the CRAmong them, the most important project was the Jianguo yilai Mao Zedong wengao(TheManuscriptsofMaoZedongsincetheFoundationofthePRC)publishedbetween 1987 and 1998. But the CR materials of Mao only constituted 2, out of 13

25volumes, in this project. This was one of the primary sources of Mao that I used inthis dissertation. Nonetheless, many important articles and speeches by Mao duringthe CR,or parts of these,were deliberately obliterated in this collection.Therefore,scholars have had to resort to other versions of Mao's collected works, such as LongLiveMaoZedongThought(MaoZedong sixiangwansui),published during theCR byvarious Red Guard and rebel factions.There were hundreds of versions of Long LiveMao Zedong Thought, which were compiled and printed by various massorganizations during the CR. I used thefive-volume LongLiveMao ZedongThoughtprinted in Wuhan between 1967 and 1968.According to Lao Tian's study, with morethan fifteen hundreds pages, this five-volume set was in fact edited by WangChaoxing, a teacher in the Philosophy Department in Wuhan University. This isprobably the most comprehensive edition.’ Some of the English translations ofMao's works from Red Guard publications I used in my dissertation were from theSelected Works of Mao Zedong,published in India byKrantiPublications,Secunderabad, and Sramikavarga Prachuranalu, Hyderabad.18

I utilized whatever English sources I could find about the Cultural RevolutioninShanghai.NealHunter's ShanghaiJournal,aneye-witness of theShanghaiCommune, was a primary source that I used extensively. And I also quote a great dealfromElizabethPerry and LiXun'simportant work,ProletarianPower:Shanghai in17 See LaoTian,A note for the 1968Wuhan edition of Long Live Mao Zedong Thought liuba nian han ban MaoZedong sixiang wansui banci shuoming), from http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=1818&page=1&toread=1,citedJuly10th,2009.)18Availableonlineathttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htmcited onJan.10,2010.

The Shanghai Commune lasted for twenty days. The Shanghai RevolutionCommittee lasted for around 10 years. However, the historical experiences andlessons learned in these days, though blurred and covered, should not be silenced andconsigned to the darkness of history. The socialist revolution in China inspired by analmost 100 year legacyfrom the West, was rooted in the initiatives and struggles ofthe Chinese working people. The extensive democracy this socialist experimentpracticed, the paths it explored, and the limits and boundaries it delineated, willcontinue to shine and reverberate.The true history of the Shanghai Commune must berecovered. Every piece of historical material related to the Shanghai Commune wasproduced from irresistible rebellious passionfor creating a better world and fulfillingtheenduringChinese dream of theCommune.If myworkherecanservetocontinuethis dream, then, I am very pleased and gratified

27Chapter One: The Paris Commune Goes To China:Historical Contour and Scholarship of the Shanghai

Commune

A ChineseEye-witness of theParis Commune

On January 25, 1871, in order to deal with the Tianjing Mission Incidentwhich had erupted the previous year, a diplomatic delegation of the Qing Dynasty,headed by Chonghou (a veteran of the Foreign Affairs Yamen in the Qing court),landed on Marseille, France. One of the interpreters in the delegation, the youngZhang Deyi, began to write a journal on the Franco-Prussian War and the subsequentrise and fall of the Paris Commune. On the first night, he noticed a contingent ofFrenchsoldierspassingbyhishotel.

All of sudden,I heard musicrising outsidemyhotel. Iwalked out,

seeing that more than one hundred soldiers were disorderly passing by1The Qing Dynasty, founded after the Manchu people' conquest of China, was the last ruling dynasty of Chinafrom 1644 to 1912. In 1840, the British Empire invaded China on the pretext of free trade on opium. After that,China entered into the late Qing period (1840-1912).In June 1870,ten years after the splendid imperial SummerPalace in Beijing was burned down by allied troops of Britain and France, Tianjing, the only port city in NorthernChina at the time,witnessed anotherSino-France conflict.It beganwith thegathering and baptizing of Chineseorphans by theorphanage attachedto aCatholicchurch.This churchwas built on the siteof a razedBuddhisttemple in accordance with atreaty signed under the pressure of the French military presence.The French churchoffered payments tothose whobrought children tothe orphanage and thisincreasinglyresulted inthelarge-scalekidnapping of local children.When the French church deserted 34 dead children who had allegedly died from anepidemic,Tianjing residents were outraged and petitioned for an investigation of the church.Chinese official LiuJie confronted theFrench consul Henri Fontanier demanding an investigation.Fontanier drewhispistol and firedon Liu, missing him but killing his servant. Upon learning of this murder, thousands of angry local residentsrushed to the spot and killed Fontanier and his assistant.After that,within three hours,severalforeign churches,including a French one were set onfire,and more than tenFrench nationals werekilled.This event came to beknown as the TianjingMissionIncident.On the demand of theFrenchgovernment and fearing thepossibility ofmilitary revenge, the Qing court chopped off the heads of 18 Tianjing residents who were held responsible and senta Chonghou delegation toFrance to“offer an apology".SeeTangRuiyu,Tianjing jiao'an yanjiu(A Study on theTianjing MissionIncident),Taibei:Wenshizhechubanshe,1993.

What Zhang Deyi witnessed were French troops disheartened due to thedecisive blows by the Prussian army during the Franco-Prussian War. Three days lateranarmisticetreatywassignedbetween thetwowarringstates-therepublicanFrance.which replaced the Second Empire, namely, the Imperial Bonapartist regime ofNapoleon Ml from 1852 to 1870, and the kingdom of Prussia. At the time, France'scapital city, Paris, had finally surrendered to the Prussians. The standing army of theFrench government in Paris had been disbanded. But the National Guard, consistingof commonParisianworkers and citizens,took theinitiative todeter thePrussianarmyfrom occupying most of theParis territory.

To make things clear for readers of his journal, Zhang Deyi explained theorigin, development and result of the Franco-Prussian War in great detail - basing thison his deep study of historical and current events. In addition to meticulouslynarrating day-to-day battles, Zhang Deyi expended great efforts to describe andexplain the struggles of the Parisian people, though not always entirely accuratelyaccording to strict historiography. One of the earliest attempts of the armed uprisingof the Paris people, related by Zhang Deyi, took place on October 9, 1870. “Onehundred thousand militias, referred to as‘red heads'(hongtou) for wearing red hats.rushed to the suburb of Paris on the pretext of fighting against the Prussian army, butthen actually tried to stage an insurrection after theformation of theFrench republic2Zhang Deyi, Notes on Follwing the Mission to France (Suishifaguoji, Changsha: Hunan renmin chubanshe1982,p.87.

29The government then dispatched forces and fought them back."3 On October 18,when five thousand Prussian troops arrived at the Stone Cave Village*, the villagersrose to fight and injured more than 1,80o Prussians. In retaliation, the enemy firedcannons, destroying all the village buildings and wounding several hundreds ofvillagers.After this battle, the French government honored the villagers with a greatdeal of money. At this critical moment, Paris' citizens donated 500 cannons by savingon food and family expense. Meanwhile, all the copper and iron utensils in thechurches were collected to cast cannons. On October 31, when the Government ofNational Defense started negotiations with the Prussians to try to reach a truce,thousands of "hongtou"(national guards) surrounded the city hall and proclaimed theformation of a Commune (hongtou minzheng), but this quickly failed.? On January 7,1871, before the official signing of the armistice treaty, some rebel “hongtoudemonstrated in the streets of Paris. One street security guard who tried to stop themwas tied to a wood board and thrown into a river. In sharp contrast to the patriotism ofthe Parisian people, the ruling class of France showed that they did not care about thefuture of the state. Zhang Deyi reported that an army officer paid a visit to him inMarseilles.This officer was supposed topurchaseshoes andsocksfor thetroops,yetto Zhang's surprise, he was busy with walking around and watching plays, not tendingto his government assignments. Further, “"when Paris had been under siege [by thePrussian army] and the emperor was captured, the streets and markets of Marseilles3 Ibid. p.93. “Red heads" (hongtou) was a derogatory term for the Chinese rebel peasants in Qing dynasty. HereZhang Deyi appropriated it to call the national guards and the ensuing communards in Paris as they carried redflags.4 The placename is literally translated from Shitoudong cun in Zhang Deyi's journal. I am not sure where it is.5Ibid.pp.93-95.

30werefull offestivity --with strains of music accompanied by drumbeats and therumblings of carriages." On March 1, thirty thousand Prussian troops, singingtriumphant songs, marched intoParis while armed French soldiers vigilantly guardedroads to prevent the common French citizens from watching the Prussian ceremony.

On March 17, 1871, Zhang Deyi arrived in Paris from Bordeaux. On March 18,the government sent regular troops to Montmartre and other places hoping to disarmthe city and seize the National Guard's cannons. But the troops that were sent outrebelled and shot two of their commanders, General Claude Lecomte and GeneralClement Thomas. The next day, Zhang Deyi recounted that thousands of rebelsflooded into Paris and gathered at the Vendome square. They jubilantly proclaimedthe fromation of their new organ of power - the Paris Commune. Since almost allgovernmental officials fled toVersailles, the rebels controlled the city. Furthermore.all the government soldiers turned their guns upside down to show their unwillingnessto fight against the rebels. After the insurrection of March 18, Zhang Deyi fled toBordeaux, and then went to Versailles. En route to Versailles, Zhang saw a greatnumber of navy soldiers withblue jackets and strawhats.Zhang wastold that“theregular troops did not want to fight with the rebels, so the navy troops were called into fight."8 After the formation of the Paris Commune, Zhang Deyi stayed inVersailles.Buthewasstill abletoobtaininformationfromParis.Helearned,forinstance, that the Paris Commune had lost a large amount of gun powder when agunpowder storehouse caught fire. This incident caused more than 5o0 deaths and6Ibid.p.103.7Ibid.pp.126-1278Ibid.pp.137-138

31injuries tofemale communards whohad beenin charge of makinggun powder.Afterthe March 18 rebellion, Zhang noted that not only were all the qualified men requiredto serve in the national guards, but Paris women also played a vital role. “Some ofthem took part in making powder, some made cloth bags and filled them with sandsand stones to build fortresses and batteries, and those good at literature and writingvolunteered to draft official notices and announcements."With anexclamation ofsurprise, Zhang Deyi found that some of the Paris women even fought in the battlefields and behaved even more courageously than the men.

On May 21, Versailles troops entered Paris. The destiny of the Paris Communewas doomed. On May 23, Zhang recounted what he saw inVersailles that afternoon,

Accompanied with drumbeats and music,more than ten thousand[government] soldiers have returned to Versailles...there are twentythousand or so captured rebels.Among them,all the women werelocked in carriages, and all the men walked hand in hand. Somelowered their heads crying, and some raised their heads laughing. All[prisoners] were unkempt and pitiful..

At this moment, the communard resistance continued.At night,“viewednorthwards [from Versailles], a big fire erupted in Paris. The thunder of cannons hasbeen roaring ceaselessly," Zhang explained,“even though Paris was captured, thehongtou (communards) still hold some batteries outside the city. Thus the cannons andfirearms fire every now and then."A curious deputy diplomat from Italy died from astray bullet as he was observing the capture of Paris." In the afternoon of June 2,9Ibid.p.166.10 Ibid.p.16811 Ibid.p.168.

32Zhang observed that about 1,200 rebel prisoners passed byhis hotel.

Among them there are two lines of female prisoners. Although theinclothes and shoes are broken and their faces are stained with dust, theirforeheads show a brave spirit... Now several hundred female fightersare captured.According to their confessions in court, most the actions,like arson and resisting of arrest, were taken on the women's initiative.Yesterday, the court ordered those major female culprits tobe shotwhile the rest of them are to be exiled to New Caledonia.12

The next day, in the evening, again, some 2,500 communards who were beingtaken under armed escort passed by Zhang's hotel. “Some are smoking, and some aresinging. Though captured, they expressed their intrepidness by smoking andsinging. "13On June 6, another 1,800 captured rebels passed by Zhang's hotel,including more than one hundred women.“Though wearing dark clothes, all thewomen presented a dignified appearance. None of them looked weak and cowed.14

As a young diplomat from a feudal society of the East, Zhang Deyi could notgrasp the great significance of the rise and fall of the Paris Commune, though he keptday-by-day records in his journal. Instead, by using the derogatory term hongtou todescribe the communards Zhang distanced himself from those brave communards andidentified himself with the French ruling elite class, to which Zhang and hisdelegation were sent to deliver an apology for the Tianjing Church Incident. In sharpcontrast, the aborigines of New Caledonia, who were harshly treated by the Frenchguards of the deported communards, attacked not the prisoners, but the guards. Theseguards were the common enemy of both the communards and the aborigines. At the12 Ibid.pp 171-17213Ibid.p.17314 Ibid.p.174

33time,LouiseMichel,afamousfemalecommunardwhohadbeenexiled,tooktheaborigines' side in their revolt.When the tribal chief, who organized the attacks on theFrench guards, died, he was draped in the red flag of a Paris arrondissement by theexiled communards. The aborigines in the Pacific and the proletariat of Europe hencejoined together in their common struggle.' Nonetheless, judging from his touchingdescriptions of the captured communards, the young Chinese diplomat Zhang Deyidid show some sympathy, respect and even admiration toward the valiant fighters ofthe Paris Commune. This sympathetic feeling, which might have come from hisdiscontent about the role of French imperialism in China, complicated hisidentification with theFrench ruling class

ZhangDeyi's NotesonFollowingtheMissiontoFrance(Suishifaguoji),withits detailed descriptions of the Paris Commune, was not openly published until itsrediscovery in 1982, so its influence remained very limited. Zhang Deyi did not relizethat what he had witnessed could have a significant impact on human historyincluding the course of history in his own country. In fact, as an illuminating andappealing vision and revelation, the Paris Commune greatly inspired the Chinesepeople. The Commune imagination reemerged again and again in the Chinese questfor the (re-) construction of a new state structure.Although Zhang's account wassilenced for more than one hundred years, it offers tangible traces of the beginning ofthe complex connections and interactions between theParis Commune andsubsequent events in Chinese history. My dissertation, in this regard, attempts to offer15 Duvignaud, Juls, Le Language Perdu, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1973, pp. 52-53.Translated inTheParis Communein Communist China:AnAnthropological Perspective,in Dialectical Anthropology,Volume1,Number1,1975,pp.384-385

34an in-depth study of one of the historical moments and conjunctures that was inspiredby the Paris Commune, the Shanghai Commune during the heyday of the CulturalRevolution.Obliteration and Commemoration of theParis Communein theWest

The rise and fall of theParis Commune in 1871 was a major historical event inthe modern world. It was a heaven-storming effort to set up a government ofproletarian rule. Though it only lasted 72 days - from March 18 to May 28 - the ParisCommune attempted to expropriate the expropriators. This was, of course, absolutelyintolerable for the ruling exploiting class. After the defeat of the Paris Commune, thecommunards suffered tremendous brutality, torture, executions and many were exiled.InLaSemaineSanglante(BloodyWeek),Benedict Andersonestimates that theVersailles“executed roughly 20,000 Communards or suspected sympathizers, anumber higher than those killed in the recent war or during Robespierre's “Terror'of1793-94. More than 7,500 were jailed or deported to places like New Caledonia.'16In sum, among some 300,000 communards, 30,000 were slaughtered by the Frenchbourgeois troops, 50,000 were later executed or incarcerated and 7,000 were exiled.17According to Jacques Rougerie, Paris lost approximately 100,000 of itsworkersone-seventh of its adult working men.After the defeat of theParisCommune the electoral registers recorded a loss of some 90,0o0 voters, all male since16Anderon,eedit,IntWrd-ShaowofBismarck andoblwfReviw28July-August 017 From Alfred Cobban's estimation, in A History of Modern France.

35women did not have the right to vote.18

The bourgeois ruling class not only physically crushed the Paris Commune. Italso tried to erase the glorious (to the masses) or horrifying (to the ruling class)memory and lessons of the Paris Commune. When Leon Gambetta, a bourgeoisrepublican leader, granted all ex-Communards amnesty,he said,“You must close thebook on these last ten years... You must place the tombstone of oblivion over thecrimes and vestiges of the Commune."s19

Still today, the story of the Paris Commune continues to be distorted and thishas roots in the way the bourgeoisie reacted right after the final Bloody Week. Thebourgeois class immediately began to launch a concerted campaign to obliterate thememory of the Commune.2° First of all, after defeating the Paris Commune, thebourgeoisie set out to restore the city to the way it was before the conflict. On June 21,1871, the young Chinese diplomat Zhang Deyi passed by the demolished ColumnVendome,whichhad beenerectedbetween1806and1810inParis inhonor of thevictories of Napoleonic France. The Commmunards demolished it because theyregarded it as a symbol of the bourgeois state. Zhang wrote in his journal that "morethan fifty thousand workers were hired²', going in for large scale construction" torestore the Column Vendome. The repair work would be“finished on a set date” andthe Column would appear brand new then. On June 24, Zhang reported that even asthe Communards were still being hunted down, “all the crucial points and the bustling18 Wilson, Colette E., Paris and the Commune, 1871-78: The Politics of Forgetting, Manchester University Press,2008. p.1.19 Ibid. p.1.20 Ibid.p.1.21 This number could be exaggerated.

36and flourishing places were neatly fixed and decorated." In June and July, Paris saw aplethora of cafes, entertainment venues, circuses, parks and markets open to theoublic. On July 27, Zhang Deyi accompanied his superior Chonghou to the grandopening of a park. He was shocked at what he saw: “On entering the park, stars shinein the sky while thousands of lights illuminate the park. At the center of the park thereis a dance pavilion, from which music rings loudly. It is really pleasant to theear....Groups of prostitutes, walking leisurely and gracefully, look like fairiesdropping down into this world. Flocks of flaneurs are busy pursuing these ladies. Thewhole country seems to be enchanted."Amidst the light dancing music of the Parisbourgeoisie right after the Bloody Week, the bodies of tens of thousands of Parisworkers were buried deep in the catacombs of history. A Paris of the proletariat wasreplacedbyaParisof thebourgeoisie

In addition, as Colette E. Wilson argued, the governments of the early ThirdRepublic of France tried to erase thememory of theParis Communein twomajonways. The first was to enforce strict censorship of all matters concerning theCommune. The other was through the reinvention of Paris as a modern, healthyhygienic and regenerated metropolis during the1878Expositionuniverselle(WorldFair) and the Féte du 30 juin (Festival of 30 June). Furthermore, the mainstreambourgeois writers, artists, and photographers “were often apparently willing toconform to the officially promoted view of the city."22 They actively participated inthe demonization of the Commune and its fighters. For instance, the female22 Wilson, Colette E.,2008, p.2

37Communardsweredepictedinthemainstreamnarrative asincendiaries anddegenerate prostitutes.After the collapse of the Commune, some photographers evenmade fake photographs to distort what had actually happened. They even invitedactors and actresses to act out certain scenarios of the Commune and pose forphotographs. One such “photo", for example, portrayed the execution of hostagestakenfrom the churches.Another oneshowed the shooting of two generals—GeneralClaude Lecomte and General Clement Thomas.'In reality these two generals werebrutal butchers of the working masses. But in the manufactured photographs, thesetwo generals appeared heroic and brave in the face of the firing squad of the rebelsThe defaming of the Paris Commune by the state and its supportive intellectual elitesfrom 1871 onwards has been so effective that up to today “the Commune, no less thanthe Algerian war of independence, continues to be marginalized in the Frencheducation system and there remains much ignorance both in France and elsewhereabout this‘otherFrenchrevolution'and theterribleretributionmetedoutbythestateto its own people.'*24

But the history of the Paris Commune could not be so easily and totally erased.Somepeople distorted,demonized,effaced andforgot,while others unfolded.uncovered, glorified and commemorated. History could not come and go without anytraces.Even though manyintellectualswhowere contemporaries of theParisCommune such as Nietzsche, were hostile to the Commune,more than a few writersand artists, such as Arthur Rimbaud and Edouard Manet, expressed their sympathy to23 See the cover story of thebook TheParis Commune FromtheRight TheEnglishHistorical Review:Supplement),by Roberts,J. M.,Longman,1973.24Wilson,ColetteE.,2008.p.210.

38the Commune. More importantly, after fleeing the Third Republic of France andscattering tovarious countries,agreatnumber of ex-Communards,such asProsperOlivier Lissagaray,JulesValles,Gustave Courbet,used their pens and paintbrushes toreclaimthememoryof theCommune.Fortheex-Communards,thelovefor theCommune and the trauma inflicted by the oppressive bourgeois state machinery wereso deep-rooted that their memories of the Commune could never fade away. Many ofthese authors spared no inkin glorifying the Commune and condemning its antithesisthe Versailles authority. For example, speaking of the nature of the Commune and itsantithesis, Pierre Vesinier (who was elected into Commune in the April 16thby-elections and helped to create a Jacobin-inspired Committee of Public Safety),wrote the following words after he fled to England following the defeat of theCommune,

The armed people of Paris were fighting then, above all for theabolition of theexploitation of man by man; for the destruction of allprivileges, monopolies, despotism, and economical, political andreligious tyrannies; for the suppression of the proletariat, of misery andpauperism; in a word, for the complete, radical, and absoluteemancipation of all the working classes.2

...Versailles, or the majority of the Assembly, representedfeudalism, the middle ages, the old royalist and Catholic society, withall its prejudices and antiquated privileges, anti-revolutionists forwhom the years 1789,1792,1830, 1848,1870, 1871, and the wholenineteenthcentury,hadnoexistence;Paris,ortheCommunepersonified the aspirations and hopes of the travailleurs-proletaires fora new and better world by the complete transformation of society; itwas the negation,the destruction,the absolute overthrow of present

institutions, and the radical abolition of all exploitation. This was how25 Vesinier, Pierre, History of the commune of Paris, Published first in English, translated by J. V. Weber(Chapman and Hall,London,1872),pp.187-188.

39thequestionstoodfrom thefirstsittingof theCommune.26

One of the earliest and strongest apologists and supporters of the Communewas Karl Marx, “a German doctor of philosophy with a German breadth of knowledgederived from observation of the living world and from books.*27 Marx closelyobserved the Paris Commune and spoke highly of the first working-men's governmentin the world. When the Communal troops were heroically fighting against theVersailles armies, on April 12, 1871, Marx wrote to his doctor friend LudwigKugelmann in Hanover, exuberantly hailing the communards' historical initiative,elasticity, and great capacity for sacrifice. “After six months of hunger and ruincaused rather by internal treachery than by the external enemy, they rise, beneathPrussianbayonets,asiftherehadneverbeenawarbetweenFrance andGermany andthe enemy were not at the gates of Paris. History has no like example of a likegreatness. If they are defeated only their *good nature' will be to blame."28Inahistorical moment that Marx's close friend Engels depicted as"if the proletariat wasnot yet able to rule, the bourgeoisie could no longer do so.,"*299theseParisianworkingpeople, without the least hesitation, took the historical initiative to revolt against theold world. Marx realized that a proletarian insurrection in the besieged city of Paris, inthe face of the dominant bourgeois military forces of both French and Prussia, wouldbe an act of desperate folly. But when the revolt took place, Marx wanted to march26 Ibid. pp. 174-175.27 John Hicks & Robert Tucker Eds.,Revolution and Reaction: The Paris Commune 1871, The University ofMassachusettsPress,1973,p.73.28 Karl Marx,Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, p.284.29 Ibid. p.24.

40withthem.Marxrecognizedthatitwouldbetooeasyand absurdtothinkthathistorical struggles could only be made in condition of infallibly favorable chances;"accidents" would play their parts as well in any struggles. In such a critical historicalmoment, of political crisis and war, if "accidents" compelled the working class to act.then they should take up the fight. In another letter to Kugelmann on April 17, Marxexpressed his view that if the working class succumbed without any struggle, “"thedemoralization of the working class would have been a far greater misfortune than thesuccumbing of any number of “leaders’*, 30 However, Marx underestimated howcruel the bourgeoisie would be in their revenge when “the proletariat dares to take itsown interests and demands." As Marx put it, "1848 was only child's play comparedwith the frenzy of the bourgeoisie in 1871."s1 In the struggle against "the nefariouscivilization based upon the enslavement of labor", not just numerous leaders, but alsohundreds of thousands of courageous common men, women and children weresacrificed for the grand cause of the first proletarian government. Even after thecapture of the city by the bourgeois armies, with the spirit of heroic self-sacrifice, theParisian laborers fought fearlessly for eight days! "The Paris people dieenthusiasticallyfor the Commune in numbers unequalled in any battleknown tohistory." As the young Chinese diplomat Zhang Deyi heard and witnessed, theworking women of Paris actively participated in the cause of the Commune, actingwith even braver than the men. These working women would “joyfully give up their30Ibid.p.285.31Ibid. p.24.

41lives at the barricades and on the place of execution.*32

But the blood of the Communards was not shed in vain. During the 72 days ofits short-lived existence, the Paris Commune, for the first time in the human history,provided the model for future struggles for emancipation by the working class.“Thegreat social measure of the Commune was its own existence." And its specialmeasures “could but betoken the tendency of a government of the people by thepeople.33 Politically, the historical creations of the Commune included theseparation of Church from the State; the abolition of a regular army; the abolition ofthe old military bureaucracy; the institution of general elections for all officials,whose payment could not go beyond a skilled worker's salary; the incorporation offoreigners into the Commune; and the introduction of free tuitions. Economicmeasures takenby theCommuneincluded the abolition of nightwork in thebakeries;the prohibition of monetary fines under various pretexts in the factories; theconfiscationofclosedfactoriesandworkshopswhichwerethenturnedovertoworkers'associations;thehalttoforeclosures of mortgages and determent ofpayments of rent; the provision that a man took responsibility to support his femalepartner; and pensions to all widows whose husbands died for the Commune's cause.These historical measures were not derived from the principles of Proudhonism andBlanquism, which were prevalent among the Communards, but were simply based onthe “practical elasticity of demands". As Marx put it,34

42to the end by the French workingpeople as well as thefightersfrom other Europeancountries, such as Russia, Poland, Italy, Belgium, etc.,--has a decidedly internationalcharacter. Even though the Paris Commune was brutally suppressed by the Frenchbourgeoisie, as the greatest workers'uprising in the 19" century, it exertedtremendous influence on subsequent proletarian struggles, first in Europe, thenthroughout the world. As Lenin expounded, “The sacrifices of the Commune, heavyas they were, are made up for by its significance for the general struggle of theproletariat: it stirred up the socialist movement throughout Europe, it demonstratedthe strength of civil war, it dispelled patriotic illusions, and destroyed the naive beliefin any efforts of the bourgeoisie for common national aims. The Commune taught theEuropean proletariat to pose concretely the tasks of the socialist revolution.*35 Afterthe Paris Commune, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, a great number ofworkers' parties and organizations in other countries were established. This resulted incountless strikes in the following years in different parts of the world. The workersmovement in Europe was spurred on by the model of the Paris Commune, as it provedthat the workers could master their own destinies and form their own organ ofpolitical, free from expropriators and elite control. Especially, among the Russianrevolutionaries during the last thirty years of the 19th century, the principles and spiritof the Paris Commune were widely invoked.1905 saw a series of worker strikes,peasant protests, terrorist attacks, and revolts across the imperial Russia partly due tothe defeat of the Russian army in the Russian-Japanese war. Amid political turbulence,35 Lenin on the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1970. p.22.

Yet in the eyes of Lenin, the Soviets in 1905 and those in the1917 revolution were still only in embryo before seizing the whole state power. “TheSoviets will be able to develop properly, to display their potentialities and capabilitiesto the full only by taking over full state power; for otherwise they have nothing todo.."36 At last, with the October Revolution of 1917, the Soviets gained full controlof the Russian state machinery. Following the example of the Paris Commune, a newtype of state power organ was established under the name of the Russian Soviets ofWorkers', Soldiers’and Peasants' Deputies, which was hailed by Lenin as a “stateapparatus"of the same type as theParis Commune.37

The Commune Practice in China

The Paris Commune also deeply influenced Chinese politics in the 2o"h century.As mentioned earlier, in the beginning of 1871, the late Qing government had to senda diplomatic mission to Paris to deliver an apology for the Tianjing Mission IncidentAndtheFranco-PrussianWarwasrecordedbyafewdiplomatsinthismissionincluding the young Chinese interpreter Zhang Deyi, who wrote Notes on FollowingtheMission toFrance(Suishi faguoji).?°But these diplomats'accounts of theParis36 Ibid. p.95.37Ibid.p.93.381In addition to Zhang Deyi, Chonghou and Gao Congwang, who were in the same diplomatic delegation, wroteeye-witness accounts of the Paris Commune as well, but their records of the Paris Commune were never published.See Li Changlin,Lueyi liangbu guorenbali gongshemujiji(A Brief Comment onTwo ChineseWitnesses of the

44Commune did not have much influence upon the Chinese peoplefor theywere notopenly published at the time. But during the Franco-Prussian War, an AmericanmissionaryinShanghaiputoutChinaChurchNews(zhongguojiaohuixinbao)inChinese which covered news in and outside of China. From August 1870, it began tocover the Prussian-Franco War. In the next year, Chinese people were able to readlengthy reports on the Paris Commune in this newspaper. Later on, Wang Tao, one ofthe contributorstoChinaChurchNews,wrotetwobooks—AConcisehistory of theFrance(faguozhilue)and Account of thePrusso-FranceWar(pufa zhanji)that amplydiscussed the Paris Commune - though, understandably, from the point of view of theruling elite, similar to Zhang Deyi's accounts. Shortly after the above writings, somecontemporary bourgeois revolutionaries, such as Song Jiaoren, commented on theParis Commune sympathetically. In 1907, another favorable comment on the ParisCommune,entitled “The Revolution in the New Century"(xin shiji zhi geming),wasoffered by some Chinese anarchists living in Paris. It tried to depict the ParisCommune as an anarchist socialist revolution, and argued that the defeat of theCommune was due to the fact that revolutionary thought was not popular in France,and that the Commune did not use iron-fist force to suppress counterrevolutionariesBut generally speaking, knowledge of the Paris Commune in China was very sporadioand its influence was to a great extent limited until the Russian Bolshevik revolutionin 1917.

45Chinese significantly. “It was through the Russian Revolution that the Chinese foundMarxism,"the Chinese communist leader Mao Zedong wrote,“Before the OctoberRevolution, the Chinese were not only ignorant of Lenin and Stalin, they did not evenknow of Marx andEngels.The salvoes of the October Revolution brought usMarxism-Leninism.'39 When the Chinese revolutionaries learned that the RussianSoviets were actuallyinspiredby theParis Commune,theybegan to assiduouslystudy its principles and significance. During World War 1, due to the labor shortage inFrance, as many as 150,000 Chinese workers went there between 1916-1920. Amongthem there were about 28,0oo Chinese intellectuals and quite a few communistsympathizers.40 Some of them, including Nie Rongzhen, Deng Xiaoping, Li Fuchun,Cai Chang, inspired by the victory of the Russian revolution, went to the“Mur desFédérés" in 1921 and pledged to fight for Communism.4 Thereafter, increasingefforts were devoted by the early Chinese communist intellectuals, such as Qu QiubaiZhou Enlai, Li Da, and Li Dazhao, to introduce the Paris Commune into China -whichbecame a good example and model for the Chinese proletariat. In1926 and1927, great ceremonies were held in Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other cities in thecommemorationofthe55thand56thanniversariesofthePariscommune.Thesewereled by the Guomindang regime which was still revolutionary, with the enthusiasticparticipation of Chinese communists. In 1927 alone,more than one million39 Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. IV, Peking: Foreign Languages Press, 1969, p. 413.40Xianyu Hao,Liufaqinggong jianxueyundong shigao(TheHistoryof ChinesePractice ofWorkingWhileStudying inFrance),Chendu:Bashu shushe,1994,p.212.And Perry,Elisabeth,From Paris to the Paris of the EastandBack:Workers As Citizens inModernShanghai,in Comparative Studies inSociety andHistory,Vol.41,No.2(April1999),p.352.41Xie,Xiaonai, Jianding de xinnian zhuanglu de zhengcheng: Nie Rongzhen huiyilu duhou(Firm Conviction,Splendid Journey:After Thoughts onReadingReminiscences of NieRongzhen),inPeople's Daily (Renmin ribao),May25,1986.

46revolutionaries tookpart in the commemoration of theParis Commune; rallies.lectures, and parties were held everywhere.42 Among them two major communistleaders, Zhang Tailei and Mao Zedong gave special lectures on the Paris CommuneMao'slecture“SomePointsforAttentioninCommemoratingtheParisCommunewas delivered to the Guomindang Political Training Group on March 18, 1926 at thecommemoration of the 55th anniversary of theParis Commune.“The ParisCommune,” Mao pointed out in this lecture, clearly “saw the opening of a brightflower, while the Russian Revolution represents the happy fruit. The RussianRevolution is the continuation of the Paris Commune." Mao further explained why ittooksolong—fifty-fiveyears—forChinesetoinitiatethefirstcommemorationof theParis Commune,

Mao went on to underline some important points and the significance of the42 This number is from Chen Shuping,Bali gongshe yu zhonguo (The Paris Commune and China),Beijing:Zhongguo renmin daxue chubanshe, 1988, p, 99.According to Chen Shuping's study, on March 18, 1927, inWuhan alone,more than 80o,000 people participated in the commemoration of the Paris Commune. Quote fromthe samebook,p.94.

47commemorationoftheCommune.Firstly,Maobelieved thattheCommunewasaresult of the maturing of objective conditions that included the mightyFrenchworkers’ movement and the development of capitalism into imperialism in theEuropean countries. Secondly, bourgeois wars, domestic or international, aremeaningless (not wars that the proletariat should take sides in). In contrast, what themasses need to wage are class wars, in which the oppressed classes rise up andoverthrow the classes of the oppressors,domestic and international.Thirdly,Maoreaffirmed Marx's view that "the history of humanity is a history of class struggle."And the Paris Commune was the first political and economic revolution in which theworking class arose to overthrow the ruling class. Fourthly, it was necessary to takelessons from the defeat of the Paris Commune, and he argued that the primary causeof the Commune's defeat was the lack of a united, centralized, and disciplined party tolead the Commune. The second reason lay in the conciliatory and merciful attitudes oftheCommunetowarditsenemy.43

In 1927, inspired by the “bright flower”of the Paris Commune and the “happyfruit"’ of the Russian Revolution, the Chinese working people set up their owncommunes in two major cities—Shanghai and Guangzhou, though they did not callthese new organs of power communes. When the Nationalist troops (who were stillrevolutionary at that time) approached Shanghai, the workers, led by Zhou Enlai, LuoYinong and other communists, carried out three insurrections between 1926 and 1927,against the warlords who controlled the city. During the secret preparations for the43 MaoZedong,“Some Points for Atention in Commemorating the Paris Commune",in Mao's Road to Power:RevolutionaryWritings1912-1949Vol.2:NationalRevolutionandSocialRevolutionDecember1920-June1927,ed.by Stuart R.Schram, and NancyJane Hodes,M.E.Sharpe,December 1994,pp.365-368.

48second uprising of Shanghai in 1927, Luo Yinong, then secretary of the Shanghaidistrict committee of the Communist Party, remarked: "First there must be a generalstrike. All the masses will immediately rise up to make speeches and hold meetings inpreparation for creating a Shanghai Paris Commune."44 The third insurrection onMarch 21, 1927, just three days after big commemorations of the 56th anniversary oftheParis communeinvariousChinesecities,turned out tobesuccessful.As aresultthe first Chinese Commune regime was established in 1927.45 Elisabeth Perrydescribes the similarities between the Paris Commune and the Shanghai Uprisings: inboth cases, the workers fought alongside other citizens for the shared goal ofmunicipal autonomy; both were sparked by resentment on the part of urban residentstoward the occupation of their cityby unwelcome intruders—whether Prussians orChinese warlords; the new government after the Shanghai Uprisings modeled on theParis Commune, established provisions for direct popular election of (and, ifnecessary, the recall of) representatives; the Shanghai workers assumed dominantpositions in the new power organ; similar to the Paris Commune, every Shanghaifactory, craft union, shopkeepers' federation, peasant association, merchant guildmilitary barracks, school, and professional organization held mass meetings for thedirect election of both district and all-city delegates; by abolishing the standing army44Shanghaigonqren sanciwuzhuangqiyiShanghai'sThreeWorkersAmedUprisings)ShanghaiMunicipalArchives,ed.(Shanghai:1983),p.70.Quoted from Perry,Elisabeth,From Paris to the Paris of the East and Back:Workers AsCitizens inModernShanghai,inComparative Studies inSociety and History,Vol.41,No.2(April1999),p.353.45 The power organ established after the third workers'uprising in Shanghai was the Shanghai ProvisionalMinicipal Government, which was elected by the Shanghai Provisional Congress of Citizen Representatives.

51ceases to be a class attribute.*49 Mao did not name the new state organ of power inthe May 7 Directive. But in envisioning the new society as a“great school",withinwhich the three major disparities (sanda chabie)in socialist China-between manualand mental labor, between industry and agriculture, and between workers andpeasants-were tobe gradually abolished,he delineated the contours of a Communestate.Two months later, in the early stage of the CR, Mao coined the term “ChineseParis Commune"(zhongguo bali gongshe) in remarking about the first big characterposter atBeijingUniversity.

In the official statement as to the goal of Cultural Revolution, the 16-PointDecision, which was issued on Aug 8,1966, Point 9 that was titled “CulturalRevolutionary Groups, Committees and Congresses" directly called for looking to theParis Commune as a model. Before the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese proletariatand other masses were dissatisfied with the bureaucracy and gradual degeneration ofat least parts of the Chinese Communist Party. Before the CR, even a word ofcriticism directed at Party leaders could lead to an accusation of “counter-revolution".Many cadres in the party, represented by the Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping factions,werenotwillingtocontinuetherevolution,even overtlyorcovertlyopposingMao'stheory and practice of continuous revolutions in building socialism and achievingcommunism.Theincreasingly-intensified two-line struggle within the party betweenthe Maoists and the Liu-Dengists made the CR inevitable.5° During the CR, there was49 The Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (hereafter MECW).

The call for acommune became a genuine aspiration for the masses in Shanghai, who took Mao'sMay 7 Directive and the 16-Point Decision as their political and ideological weaponsIn the last days of 1966, in the heat of the CR, the party bureaucracy in Shanghaisecretly ordered their conservative supporters to abandon their jobs -hoping that thiswould paralyze whole Shanghai port, and put a brake on the momentum of the CR.But rebel workers in Shanghai, led by Wang Hongwen and his fellow rebel leaders,recognized this as a great and rare chance and initiated a mass movement on their owninitiative. In the beginning of 1967, the rebel workers, together with the rebel students,launched the powerful "January Storm"which turned the city life upside down. By themiddle of the month, the rebels had taken control of the city administration,and earlyin the following month, through a tortuous road, the Shanghai People's Commune.modeled after the1871 Paris Commune,was finally established.The old bureaucraticadministration was replaced by a new popular government organ, which virtuallyexcluded all the old high ranking party and city officials. The manifesto of theShanghai Commune reaffirmed the principles of the Paris Commune. All the leadersof this new government power were representatives of various mass organizations,who could be recalled at any time by the masses. Though the Shanghai Communeonly lasted for 20 days, and was subsequently replaced by Three-in-One Combinationleadership,alsoknownas theTripleAllianceRevolutionaryCommitteefavored bycombine the two and refer to the party persons with similar thinking and practices toLiu Shaoqi and DengXiaoping as“Liu-Dengists",or“Liuists"

As early as the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960) period, a new phrase “newsocialist things"(shehui zhuyi xinsheng shiwu, also translated as “socialist newthings") was coined to refer to those things emerging from the three great practices,namely, class struggle, and the struggles for production and scientific experiment,under the dictatorship of the proletariat.? Many “new socialist things" came intoexistence at that time, and among them the most important one was the creation ofpeople's communes in rural areas. In some cities, there was also experimentation withcity communes. During the Great Leap Forward, Liu-Dengist cadres blew "fivewinds" (wufeng), namely, a hasty leap forward of communism, exaggeration,commandism, cadre privileges, and blindly leading production. Thanks toLiu-Dengists’ disruption, to a certain degree, the socialist cause in China sufferedsetbacks. Many “"new socialist things", as a result, could not be sustained andfurther developed. For example, a great number of peasant-run factories had to closedown because they no longer had state support. And due to the policy of san zi yibao,33 advocated by Liu Shaoqi and his lieutenants, the rural communes were put injeopardy. In 1966, with the launch of the CR, the Maoist leaders put the issue of “new51 The earliest application of the phrase “"new socialist things" can be found in Chen Bingyu's article “ResolutelySupport New Things"(Jianding de fuzhi xinsheng shiwu) published on the CCP organPeople's Daily on May 1,1960.52 Nevertheless,the Great Leap Forward achieved so much as to lay a solid foundation for Chinese agriculturaland industrial modernization, and unleashed endless initiatives and enthusiasm of the Chinese masses,especiallyChinese peasants, to envision and construct socialism and communism. Therefore, the Great Leap Forward shouldnever be lumped together with the“wufeng”(five winds),or local famines -which mainstream scholars havedone andwhich theMaoistleadership at that time activelybattled.53Literally, three elfs and neconract.Thre imeans practicing private lots,feemarkets profit-driven alenterprises, and one bao means requiring fixed output quotas on a household basis.

54socialist things"backon the agenda.In a discussionwith somehighPartycadres inthe Center (zhongyang, the Central Committee of the CCP)in July 1966, Mao Zedongmade clear that the three tasks of the CR were to struggle, to criticize, and totransform (dou pi gai). “Opposition,especially to the bourgeois “authoritativethoughts', is destruction; without this destruction, the socialist construction could notbe established and it will be impossible to No. 1 struggle, No. 2 criticism, and No. 3reform."54 Marx asserted that the workers of the Paris Commune “"have no ideals torealize, but to set free the elements of the new society with which old collapsingbourgeois society itself is pregnant."55 Along a similar vein, Mao's formula of the"struggle-criticism-transformation"aimed to liberate the masses'creativity and newproductivity, which had been counteracted for a long time by the parts of the oldbureaucratic Party and state system in China that had degenerated. The experience ofthe Great LeapForward had revealed that the development of the superstructure inChina was lagging behind the productive forces that had rapidly developed with theadoption of socialist collectivization.So there was a need togivepriority to struggleand criticism in the superstructure - in the realm of politics and ideology - couldreformbe carried out and“newsocialist things"becreated.In this sense,theShanghai Commune and its replacement, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, canbe considered“new socialist things” as well, because they were created in thetremendous momentum of struggle and criticism amid the January Storm and the CR54Mao's Speech toSomeCCPCCLeaders,July1966,fromLongLiveMaoTse-tungThought,aRed GuardPublication.

55AlongwiththeestablishmentofRevolutionaryCommitteesacrossthestateinSeptember 1968 and the opening of the Ninth National Congress of the CCP in April1969, the large scale mass movement that characterized the CR officially ended and anew phase of reform,or, creative transformation,that is,the creation of a different setof"newsocialistthings"started

At the end of 1974, the Party organ Red Flag summarized that since the start ofthe CR, a host of “socialist new things”had emerged “in the thick of the fiercestruggle between the two classes and the two lines".Among the mushrooming of newthingswere:

lively development of the mass movement in the study ofMarxism-Leninism-Mao Tsetung Thought; birth of the revolutionarycommittees and strengthening of theParty's centralizedleadership;creationandpopularization of modelrevolutionarytheatricalworks;expansion of the mass contingents of Marxist theoretical workers;enrolment of workers, peasants and soldiers in institutions of higherlearning and reform in education; educated young people settling in thecountryside and mountainous areas; medical workers going to the ruralareas; rural"barefoot doctors" and co-operative medical service; studyby the masses in their hundreds of millions of the historical experienceof the struggle between the Confucian and Legalist schools and theclass struggle as a whole; three-in-one combinations of the old, themiddle-aged and the young in leading bodies at all levels; study classesfor training worker-peasant-soldier cadres; participation in physicallabor by vast numbers of cadres; especially leading cadres; manyadvanced units in agriculture, industry, commerce, culture andeducation,and numerousinventions and creations inscience andtechnology.56

In August 1976, on the eve of Mao Zedong's death in September, the Red Flagpublished another article propagating and boosting about the“socialist new things". In56 Chi Heng,Develop the Socialist New Things (Fazhan shehui zuyi de xinsheng shwu), in Red Flag,N.12,1974.The English translation could be found in Peking Review,No51,December 20,1974.

56addition towhat is mentioned above,it listed manymore socialist achievements.including: the emergence of many groups and individuals good at discerning andresisting the revisionist line of Deng Xiaoping; the occupation and transformation ofthe superstructure by the working class; the management of universities and schoolsby workers and middle-lowerpeasants;the spread of the experiences of theeducational revolution in Beijing University, Qinghua University, and the ChaoyangAgricultural College in which graduates went to villages to work with the peasants inaccordance with the principle of "from the communes and back to the communes'(she lai she qu); the development of July 21 workers'universities and peasantspart-time universities throughout the country; the rotation of professional doctors inthe cities and bare-foot doctors in the villages; and the development of May 7 cadreschools.57

But all of theses creations, including the new organizational forms of statepower inspired by and modeled on the Paris Commune that emerged during the CRvirtually came to a sudden end when Mao Zedong passed away on September 9, 1976and the rightist coup d'état, plotted by Hua Guofeng, Ye Jianying, Wang Dongxing, LiXiannian and other high Party and army officials, took place on October 6, 1976.Thereafter, the Chinese regimes have been promoting an ideology of "biddingfarewell to revolution"(gaobie geming). Under such circumstances, the ParisCommune is no longer officially commemorated by the Chinese government and theCCP. As for the Chinese working people, for a quite while many of them enjoyed the57 Chen Yue, Further Develop the Socialist New Things, in Red Flag, No.8, 1976.

57wage hike and extra bonus that the Deng Xiaoping regime offered, using the statefunds accumulated mainly during the Mao era.At that time, the principles of the ParisCommune, or the Maoist theories and practices of the Chinese Communes, wasforgotten. But after 1992, the workers in the cities soon have found themselves beingreplaced by migrant workers from the rural villages. Tens of million of workers in thecities have lost their jobs since then. In response, many Chinese workers went onstrike to defend their right to work. In their struggle against capitalism, why would theChinese workingpeople not remember and reactivate the principles of theParisCommune and set up another workers'Commune in the future? After all, as Marxpredicted, the Social Revolution that the Paris Commune has initiated will triumphand “its birthstead is everywhere.*'58Scholarship on the Shanghai Commune and Contemporary Chinese

A book with a comprehensive historical account of theShanghai Commune has never been published either in the West or in China. Here Iwould like to review the worksby Chinese andWestern scholars on theShanghaiCommune and contemporary Chinese thinking on the Commune.

Memoirs of Foreign Observers of theShanghai Commune

The earliest studies on the Shanghai Commune can be traced back to narrativesby witnesses of the Shanghai CR in late 1966 and early 1967. The Australians NealHunter and his wife arrived in Shanghai in April 1965 to work as English teachers atthe Shanghai Foreign Languages Institute. With the dramatic eruptionof the CR inMay 1966 all foreign teachers in China became unemployed, even though the Chinesegovernment still paid them in accordance with their contracts. In April 1967, Hunterleft Shanghai. During his two year stay in China, Hunter had ample opportunities toobservetheearlyeventsoftheCR,especiallytheriseoftheShanghaiCommuneandits ensuing replacement, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. His book, ShanghaiJournal:AnEyewitnessAccountoftheCulturalRevolution,basedonaricharrayofwall posters, leaflets, and tabloids, is a day-to-day account of the early developmentand the climax of the CR in Shanghai. Anybody studying the Shanghai CR should notignore this precious first-hand account. As a Westerner, Hunter took the Chinese CR

59so seriously as to put forward that “the problems of China are, in a very real sense.our problem. If China finds answer to the contradictions of bureaucracy anddemocracy, revisionism and permanent revolution, industrialization and agriculture.moral and material incentives, and so on, then we will find answers.59 Hunter held inthe preface toShanghai Journal, that the Chinese Cultural Revolution presented achallenge to every society and that it influenced anti-establishment revolts in manyplaces, such as Hong Kong, Macao, Burma, Cambodia, Japan, Britain, France,Germany and the USA.6°Hunter differed from the mainstream China observers in theWest at the time in that he believed that some kind of campaign against bureaucratism,likethe CR, was necessary, because the Party could not radicalize itself without anoutside impetus, such as the Red Guards.61 For Hunter, a radical change in thepolitical structure of Shanghai during the CR - the formation of the ShanghaiCommune and the Revolutionary Committee - promised a noble future. Through the‘upgrading of popularforces and downgrading of tired bureaucrats toprovide the citywith revolutionary energy for a number of years, 62Hunter argued that the influx ofnew blood, i.e. the rebels, the revolutionized veteran cadres and army delegateswouldbringaboutarevitalizedgovernmentwithnewmethodsandoriginalapproaches. Hunter held that the CR had an “anticlimactic ending" -here he is,possibly referring to the replacement of the Commune-style power organs with therevolutionarycommittees.But heinsisted that theCR as a whole,wasatleast59 Hunter, 1969, pp.291-292.60Ibid.p.3.61Ibid,pp.294-296.62Ibid.pp.293-294

60partially—an economical, political, and spiritual success for China.63 William Hinton,a famous chronicler of the Chinese revolution originally known for his book“Fanshen”, appreciated Hunter's detailed narrative of the Shanghai CR and found it“fascinating” and “very valuable". But Hinton also thought that Hunter' politicalstance followed a “sophisticated pro-revisionist line”with “subtly expressed bias infavor of the capitalist roaders while they are still in power, that shifts to strong supportfor ultra-left ‘overthrow all' forces once the establishment is toppled". Hinton'scriticism ofHunter continued:

To Hunter proletarian revolutionaries are“Rebels" butright-opportunist counter-revolutionaries are“Moderates". Cao Diqiu'sbourgeois dictatorship in Shanghai is pragmatic common sense, butZhang Chunqiao's proletarian dictatorship is minority rule based onpolice power and army support.Zhang himselfis a“schemer."Shanghai Workers General Headquarters, the mass base on whichZhang Chunqiao, with Mao's support, built a new revolutionary powerin Shanghai, is consistently downgraded, described as lacking support.losing support, a mere shell composed mainly of outsiders, etc., whileGeng Jinzhang's split-off, ultra-left Second Regiment is blown up tolarge proportions, as a truly mass-based people's movement. WhenZhang Chunqiao's revolutionary rebels attack and criticizeconservative officials for handing out largesse in the form of bonusesand wage increases, this is a bad mistake, Zhang cannot afford toalienate such key cadre. But when Zhang's forces unite with themajority of these cadre and continue them in theirposts after criticism,this is unprincipled compromise, the whole CR turns into a charade,rebel youth and workers have been used and betrayed.64

Hunter might defend himself by stating that he merely presented the positionsof different factions without siding with any particular one. That might be true in63Ibid.pp.296-299.6William Hinton,urning Point inChina:An Essay on theCultural RevolutionMonthlyReviewPress,1972,p.78.

61some cases,but notin others.For example,readers of Hunter will findlittledescription of Zhang's virtues other than his ability to deliver speeches. Repeatedlyhinting that it was only because of Mao's support that Zhang gained support from theShanghai masses, Hunter takes every possible chance to discredit Zhang. Hunter knew,even better than others, that in the turbulent January Storm in Shanghai, it was veryhard to curb the punishment of the guilty officials by the indignant and resentfulmasses. Yet without any solid evidence, Hunter criticizes Zhang Chunqiao for being"wrong to imagine he could unify Shanghai by humiliating so many minorofficials."65 The anti-Zhang camp launched a massive campaign to struggle against“minor officials” in charge of street and lane committees and this was regarded by theParty Center as a typical way the revisionist led things in order to “strike the most andprotect a handful". But Hunter found this to be “interesting". And when ZhangChunqiao condemned such attacks, Hunter accused Zhang of suppressing the massmovement.66

According to Hinton, the essence of Hunter's book is a denial of class struggle“All the sound and fury, he avers, comes from a clash between pragmatic communistsand dogmatic communists; the result, a healthy shakeup in the bureaucracy butdefinitely not a transfer of power from one class to another. He pours scorn on theidea that the‘extreme left'could possibly have sold out to the‘extreme right'of theParty hierarchy, or have any political connection with i.67 An example of whatHinton is criticizing here can be seen in Shanghai Journal where Hunter describes the6Ibid.p.22366 Ibid. pp.248-249.67Ibid,p.79.

62CR as a fight *between two interpretations of Maoism.*68

Sophia Knight, also a foreign teacher at the Shanghai Foreign LanguagesInstitute, wrote a book entitled Window on Shanghai: Letters from China, 1965-1967.This book also contains some important descriptions and observations of the ShanghaiCR during this period. However, Knight was more cautious than Hunter in passingjudgements. She candidly admits in her letters that it was difficult to tell what wasgoing on at that time since foreigners'knowledge was unauthenticated, insufficientand often superficial when they did not directly participate in the movement. Anotherreason, she explains, was that the situation in Shanghai was increasingly complicatedand fluid.69 Yet in her book we can find many informative narratives. For example,before the January Storm, the Shanghai authority's policy toward foreigners wasbasically to not let them know what was happening. November 30, 1966, on the veryeve of the collapse of the old Shanghai authority, possibly arranged by the powerholders, foreign teachers visited a “Class Education Exhibition'. This showcasedisplayed many things confiscated from searches of houses of Red Guards. Thesewere items the Red Guards had taken from old rich capitalists, such as Guomindangflags, guns, gold bars, and old account books.After the visit, Sophia Knight wasstrongly convinced that there was a ^hidden time-bombs in our midst" -harkening tdsomething Mao had said, but using it with a very different understanding. The hiddentime-bombs to which Mao had referred actually lay elsewhere. But the Shanghaiauthorities wanted people to target something else. As it turned out, Sophia Knight68Hunter, 1969, p.118.9Sophia Knight,Window on Shanghai:Leters from China, 1965-1967,Deutsch (January 1,1967),p.227 andPp.239-240.

63and some of ther workmates left Shanghait for nearly a month. Knight's sponsoringinstitute had arranged for them to take a holiday journey to Central and SouthernChina from January 16 to February 12, 1967. So unfortunately, for historians of theShanghai Commune, Knight was not present for the climax of the Cultural RevolutioninShanghai.

EarlyWestern scholarship on theShanghai Commune

Maurice Meisner might be the first western scholar to seriously deal with thetheoretical and historical meaning of the Paris Commune in China. In his 1971 article“‘Images of the Paris Commune in Contemporary Chinese Marxist Thought", Meisnerheld that the CR was “a dramatic attempt to close the gap between radical socialtheory and conservative bureaucratic social and political practice". Meisner says thatafter 1956, while Chinese Maoists more and more emphasized the necessity of“continuous revolution"under the banner of“dictatorship of the proletariat", otherbureaucrats, who just paid lip service to Mao's revolutionary theory and practiceeffectively pulled China back to the “seeming permanence of bureaucracy"70 WhenMaoist efforts toinvigorate the state apparatus with a renewed revolutionary spiritfailed before the CR, a new solution was naturally drawn from “the Marxist principleof smashing the old machinery." Meisner believes that the call to model the ParisCommune was in response to the Maoists’immediate need to destroy an increasingly70MariceMeisner,agesoftheParisCominContporaryChinesMaxistThoughtinJhHik&Robert Tucker eds.,Revolution and Reaction:TheParis Commune 1871.Amherst:the University ofMassachusettsPress,1973,p.121.

64oppressive form of political power, as well as out of the Maoists'intellectual interestin theParisCommune.Meisner discusses threeMarxianthemes-anti-bureaucracy.egalitarianism and the spontaneous revolutionary creativity of the masses. These alllargely came from Marx's summary of the lessons of theParis Commune and wereespecially prized by the Chinese Maoists during the CR. Moreover, the ChineseMaoists had an intellectual affinity with Marx's interpretation of the Paris Commune:as blending nationalist and internationalist themes, which provided“a Marxistsanction to reconcile their strongly Chinese nationalist impulse with theirinternationalist claims and aspirations.*71 Meisner also maintained that things Marxhad identified in his analysis of the Commune - the anti-traditionalist strain, therevolutionary heroism, the necessity of proletarian revolutionary violence, themilitarization of the masses, among others - all struck a responsive chord in the heartsof the Chinese Maoists. That's why, Meisner argues, the model of the Paris Communeassumed such prominence during the CR in China. As for the Shanghai Commune.Meisner claimed that it was an “abortive" attempt by radical Maoists groups toestablish“proletarian dictatorship"in complete accordance with the revolutionaryprinciples thatMarxhadputforthinhis analysis of theParisCommune.The“demise” of the Shanghai Commune, Meisner held, “signaled the beginning of theretreat from the more utopian experiments of the CR and the beginning of a longprocess of restructuring Chinese political life on the basis of‘revolutionarycommittees’representing new mass organizations, old (but pro-Maoist) Party cadres,71 Ibid.pp.124-125.

65and the army."Meisner's critique differs with that of those scholars who stronglycriticize the Maoists for replacing the Shanghai Commune with the ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee, calling this a ^betrayal" and restoration of the pre-CRbureaucratic order. In his 1971 article, Meisner maintained that, “Although theMarxistdescription of theParis Commune nolongerserved as aliteralguideforpolitical action after the early months of 1967, many of the concepts and much of therevolutionaryimageryof theCommuneremained toinfluencesignificantlytheneworganizational structures which emerged during the Cultural Revolution."72 In 1982,when this articlewas editedintohis book Marxism,Maoism and Utopianism,Meisnerrevised his evaluation about the Revolutionary Committee, stating, “many of theconcepts and much of the revolutionary imagery of the Commune remained asignificant strand in the radical Maoist ideological tradition."73ButinthissamebookMeisner still affirms that “The concepts and images derived from the model of theParis Commune served for a time as stimulus for change and as a barrier againsttendencies to institutionalize existing social and political reality.74

Even though Meisner's analysis here is very informative and inspiring, inmany ways, his interpretation of history is somewhat static and undialectical. Forexample, Meisner labels Mao and his followers as “populists" because they valued theinitiatives of the masses. But Meisner is, at the same time, unable or unwilling toacknowledge Mao's emphasis on the importance of leadership. When Meisner claims72 Ibid. p.113.73 Maurice Meisner, Marxism, Maoism and Utopianism, WI, Madison: the University of Wisconsin Press, 1982.p.134.4Ibid. p.153.

66that the “demise”of the Shanghai Commune marked the beginning of the Maoist“‘retreat” away from the more utopian aims of the CR, Meisner forgets for a momentthepractical provisioninTheSixteen-pointProgram that stipulated and envisionedthe goal of the CR. When he says that the CR, under the influence of theanti-traditionalist strain in Marx's analysis of the Commune,launched fiercelyiconoclastic assault on“all"traditionalvalues andbeliefs,Meisneris ignoring thefactthat the Maoist later upheld the ancient Legalist Schools (fajia) represented by QinShihuang, Xunzi, Han Fei, and others - or that Mao's consistent attitude towardculture was one of "rejecting its feudal dross and assimilating its democraticessence.75 Meisner asserts that for the Maoists, “proletarian dictatorship” did notmean power exercised by the proletariat as such, but by those who possess"proletarian consciousness."76But Meisner disregards the fact that during the wholeMaoEra, several tens of millions of peasants wererecruited tobecome workers in thethefactories.And alarge number of workers were promoted to leading politicalpositions. Though modifying some of his [earlier] arguments after the CR, Meisnerstill prefers to close his eyes to the the fact that the Maoists promoted the famousslogan “The Working Class Must Exercise Leadership in Everything", and sent outWorkers Propaganda Teams (gong xuan dui) during the CR to universities, factoriesand other work-units to occupy and transform the superstructure.

In October 1971, John Bryan Starr, another famous China specialist presentedhis paper “Revolution in Retrospect: The Paris Commune through Chinese Eyes" to a75 Mao Zedong, On New Democracy, from Selected Works of Mao Zedong.

67conferenceontheParisCommunesponsoredbytheFrenchAreaStudiesCenterQueen's University at Kingston, Ontario. Starr's paper traces the increasingimportance of the Paris Commune model in Chinese political thought in the early tomid 1960s,its use during the CR, and the reasons for its precipitous decline inimportance after 1967. Similar to Meisner's view, Starr Starr puts forward thatChinese communists, including Mao, showed relatively little interest in the ParisCommune until 1957. This argument perhaps could be made in talking about theperiod of the Sino-Japan War (1937-1945). But it was not the case before the War.AsI mention above, between 1926 and 1927, with the participation of more than onemillion people, great rallies were held in many cities to mark the 55th and 56thanniversaries of theParis commune.At these commemorationsmany Chineserevolutionaries gave speeches to propagate the principles of the Paris Commune. OnMarch 18, 1926, Mao gave a lecture,“Some Points for Attention in Commemoratingthe Paris Commune", to a group of Guomingdong cadres who were still revolutionary.It is understandable that both Meisner and Starr failed to mention this importantspeech on the Paris Commune, since this article authored by Mao was only recoveredfrom an old journal in 1986.77 Starr also held that the Paris Commune played only a77This text was later reproduced in MaoZedong Wenji(Selected works of Mao Zedong), Vol. I, Beijing:Renminchubanshe,1993,pp.33-36.Meisner's claim is plausible,that before the middle of 1950s,“given the nature of therevolutionary situation,there is,of course,no particular reason why Mao should have been drawn to the writingsof Marx and Lenin on the Commune.”Meisner offered severalexplanations:firstly,that Maohad ardent faith intherevolutionary creativity of therural masses and longstanding distrust of the revolutionarycapacities of theChinese proletariat and had powerful antiurban biases; and secondly,that there was no powerful, centralizedbureaucratic state to destroy.When encountering a series of majormassacres of workers in1927in Shanghai,Guangzhou, and other citiesby Guomindang troops,Maohad to relocatepossible revolutionaryforces to ruralareas where reactionary forces were relatively weak. That did not necessarily reflect that Mao had “longstandingdistrust of the revolutionary capacities of the Chinese proletariat”" or “powerful antiurban biases." Mao's latterefforts to diminish the gap between urban and rural areas did not necessarily imply that he harbored powerfulatiurban or antirural biases.What's more,Meisner's assertion of China’absence of a powerful,centralizedbureaucratic state to destroy is equally misleading.It might be safe to say that at the first half of the 2Oth centuryChina was not fully united under one central power, but that could be not safe to say that there was no powerful,centralizedbureaucraticstate todestroy.ForMeisner'sviewpoints,seehisbookMarxism,Maoism and

68minorroleinservingasarolemodelatthetimeoftheestablishmentoftheruralandthe urban communes in1958-1959.78 On the contrary,Meisner says that there weremany similarities between the Paris Commune and the Chinese peoples’ communes.79Nevertheless, Starr correctly pointed out that, “An active interest in the details of theexperience of the Paris Commune and a concern with its relevance to contemporaryChinese domestic and foreign policies seems to have arisen during the course ofMao's formulation of the polemic arguments with the Soviet leadership during theyears 1957-64.*80 Similar to Meisner, Starr devoted one special section to “the ParisCommune and the CR", in which he focuses on the Shanghai Commune. Like mostscholars specializing in the Shanghai CR and the CR in general, Starr argued that Maoapparently abandoned the Paris Commune, because, as a model for the organizationalchanges in the CR, it “proved to be desirable but unattainable"

At the end of his article, Starr raises a “paradoxical" question: "While therhetoricalusewhichtheChinesemadeoftheParisCommunemodelintheCRemphasized strongly the themes of spontaneity and popular initiative, what little weknow of the circumstances of the actual implementation of this model suggests thatthe short-lived communes involved very little, if any, spontaneity or popularinitiative.*81 In the fourth Chapter of this dissertation, I will offer a counter narrativeand argument against Starr's viewpoints.

69on the Shanghai Commune, it was no wonder that Starr's impression of the ShanghaiCommune, before it was laid to rest, was that its only recorded act was the issuance ofa resolution on municipal sanitation, which was, as I will show, not the case.82

In the spring of 1976, the founding issue of the journal DialecticalAnthropology included a translation of the article“The Great Lessons of the ParisCommune —In Commemoration of its 95th Anniversary”from Hong Qi(RedFlag)3. The inclusion of this article reflected acknowledgement of the extraordinaryposition of the Paris Commune in Chinese revolutionary thought, and the unfortunatefact that the significance of the Paris Commune was hardly known in the West outsideof the small professional circle of sinologists and in occasional reflections by someradicals and ultra-leftists.This issue of theDialectical Anthropology alsoincluded anarticle entitled, “The Paris Commune in Communist China: An AnthropologicalPerspective", by Stanley Diamond, an American poet and anthropologist and thefounder of this journal. In this article, Diamond interestingly discusses theanthropological stage of primitivism in analyzing the attractiveforce of theParisCommune to the Cultural Revolution in China and in the world. Diamond puts forththat current thinking in China on the Commune “not only extends certain imperativesof the Commune into a contemporary arena but, in so doing, further validates thedialectical conception of primitive society as the archetype of socialism (which Marxwell understood), as a past which provides a functional (not formal) paradigm for thefuture in certain determinate ways." The roots of the Chinese perspective on a82 Ibid. p. 121.83 This English translation of this article was from the Peking Review. I will analyze it in the third chapter.

70commune,accordingtoDiamond,aretherefore,notconstrainedtotheFrenchexperience in 1871. They are also associated with the pre-state history of China, andthe social ethic (or more accurately, societal critique) which resonates with it. Tojustify his argument, Diamond quotes Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the CCP whodeeply influenced Mao, “The ethics of men has been a powerful social instinct sincethe most ancient period of human life. . . . [it] still echoes in our hearts. . . . This spiritof mutual aid, this ethic, this social instinct is able to cause human progress.*"84Diamond also follows Gong Zhongwu, a contemporary scholar, who used datong(Great Unity) thought in the Chinese tradition to interpret Maoist thought and heldthat in many of Mao's ideas “Western Marxist rationalism and the seeminglyincompatible concerns of China's ancient, ethically oriented traditions aremeaningfully synthesized." In agreement with Gong Zhongwu's view, Diamondfurther suggests that the People's Mediation Committees (of which there wereapproximately twohundred thousand thatfunctioned in China during the CR),ratherthan courts, were a reflection of respect for the autonomy of the traditional localpeasant. The People's Mediation Committees, Diamond argues, “are based on theprimitiveprincipleofcompromise,ratherthanonanultimateduel ofsocialinterests.waged by greater and lesser powers, in the name of abstract, state-upheld justice; andthey reflect the institutional dialogue that the revolutionary nation maintains withaspects of its own past."For Diamond, the Chinese Paris Commune movement wasdirected against the state apparatus in its entirety and in its conventional functioning84 Diamond, Stanley,“The Paris Commune in Communist China: An Anthropological Perspective",in DialecticalAnthropology1(1976),p.383.

71and was to a great degree driven by an anti-bureaucratic, anti-state thrust. That is, themovement was looking back to pre-state, primitive society, although this was not asimple return to primitive communalism but understood dialectially, as a higher-levelembodiment of it. But in fact such a commune was premature, given internal andexternalfactors.WhileDiamondwasconfidentthat"theprinciples of thePariscommune retain their proto-typical, normative, and critical force in China", a coupd'état duly took place in China several months later.°Against Diamond's wish, theChinese Commune movement during the CR was totally discredited in Chinathereafter.

Chinese Scholarship Aimed At Negating the Shanghai Commune

Since the1976coup d'état in China,therehas beena remarkablelack ofserious discussions about the Shanghai and the major support it had among the Maoistleadership.Almost all discussions are fall squarely with the framework of the officialverdicts of the post-Mao regime. During the campaign against the so-called “Gang ofFour"(the four major leaders or supporters of the Shanghai Commune), CharlesBettelheim, a French Marxist economist who was the chairperson of theFranco-Chinese Friendship Association at the time of the coup d'état, sharply pointedout the severe weakness of the Chinese regime's criticism of the four Maoist leaders:There is no Marxist analysis to be found in the published material, simply slander85Quotes from Stanley Diamond and his quotations of Gong Zhongwu can be found in his article “The ParisCommune in Communist China:An Anthropological Perspective", in Dialectical Anthropology 1 (1976),Pp.383-386.

72and scandal, the low level indicating the inability of the present Chinese CommunistParty leadership to develop any serious criticism of what theFour's political linemight have been.*86 The post-Mao regime's concern was not to make a serious,substantial criticism, but to pass official verdicts to negate the Cultural RevolutionResponding to a report by the new Shanghai authority filed at the end of 1978, thefirst official verdict concerning the January Storm and the Shanghai Commune wasissued the beginning of 1979. Entitled “Circular of the CCP CC Transmitting theProposal by the Shanghai Party Committee to Resolve the Problem of the So-CalledJanuary Revolution'", it was passed on to any work-units with an administrative rankequivalent to, or above, a county administration or a regiment in the military (xiantuan ji) . It was orally conveyed to selected masses, but was forbidden to be broadcastor publicized in the newspapers. In this document, the “January Revolution", whichresulted in the establishment of the Shanghai Commune, was alleged to be the resultof a conspiracy byZhangChunqiaoandYaoWenyuan.It alleges that theywanted tolaunch a full-scale power seizure of the state machinery firstly by taking power inShanghai. Zhang, Yao and other rebel leaders were said to be actual originators andproponents of the “wind of economism" in Shanghai,"′ rather than the “capitalistroaders".ThecircularalsoclaimedtherewasnoessentialdifferencebetweentheShanghai Commune and its replacement, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. Insum, what is being argued here is that the "January Revolution'was a reactionary86 Bettelheim, Charles, Burton, Neill G, China since Mao, Monthly Review Press, 1978, p.10.87For discussion of the “wind of economism" during the Shanghai “January Revolution", see the section ofBureaucratized Strike:the Spate of Economism in the third chapter The Rise of the Shanghai Commune of thisdissertation.

73storm,areactionarycountercurrentand aseriousstepinwhichLinBiao,ChenBodaand the “Gang of Four”deliberately distablized the country in order to usurp Partyleadership and seize state power. Further, the spearhead in this was directed at leadingcadres who were followers of ChairmanMao's revolutionary line. So this powerseizure was actually about trying to undo proletarian rule, to seize power from theproletariat, from the Party Center (dang zhongyang), and from Chairman Mao. Therebel leaders of the Shanghai Commune were depicted as ambitionists, conspirators,double-dealers, traitors, agents, new bourgeosie elements, reactionary literaryprostitutes, and mobs who conducted beating, smashing, and robbing.88

1n 1980, Gao Fang, a professor at Renmin University specializing in theinternational communist movement, produced one of the first articles in China thatcriticizes the“distortion"of the Paris Commune by the so-called “Gang of Four". Inhis article “The Principles of the Paris Commune and the Distortion of the Gang ofFour"(bali gongshedeyuanzehesirenbang decuangai),GaoFang condemns theGang of Four led by Jiang Qing, accusing them of misrepresenting the red flag of thedictatorship of the proletariat in the Paris Commune, and they were in fact not reallyrevolutionaries.Specifically,GaostatedthattheydistortedtheprinciplesoftheParisCommune in the following aspects: Firstly, by perverting the revolutionary principlesof the Paris Commune, they attempted to smash the proletarian state machinery andform a “Chinese People's Commune". At first glance, Gao seemes to condemn the88Circularof theCCPCCTransnitting theProposal by theShanghaiPartyCommitte toResolve theProblemoftheSo-Called“JanuaryRevolution"(zhonggongzhongyangzhuanfaShanghaishiweiguanyujiejuesuowei"yiyuegeming"wenti deqingshi baogao de tongzhi),inTheCollection of ImportantDocumentsAftertheThirdPlenum oftheEleventhCentralCommitteeof theCCP(Sanzhongquanhuiyilaizhongyaowenjianhuibian),Vol.1,BeijingRenminchubanshe,1982.

74"Gang of Four", but in fact his real target here is actually Mao Zedong -as it was Maowho had identified before the CR that state power was, in large part, not in the handsof the proletariat.And it was Mao who first came up with the concept of the “ChinesePeople's Commune". Secondly, the “Gang of Four” distorted the democraticprinciples of the Paris Commune in that they attempted to bring down the old cadresand then usurp Party leadership and seize state power. Gao argues that when the"Gang of Four” advocated Paris Commune-style general election and attacked oldcadres for not being democratically elected by the masses, that the real aim of this wasto get rid of all the old cadres. In order tobolster this argument, Gao raises the factthat the Paris Commune used both general elections and appointments to select theleaders and functionaries, and that not all of its functionaries were elected by themasses. For example, Gao points out that three kinds of functionaries were put inoffice by appointment rather than by general election: 1) Leaders of variousdepartments within the power organ such as the railway manager, the hospitaladministrator, the head of customs, the general director of the post office, wereappointed by the Committee of the Paris Commune. The directors of post officebranches (fenju juzhang) and their office heads (kezhang)were appointed by thegeneral director of the post office. 2). The army officers above the battalion level.such as general commanders, chiefs of staff, commanders of military regions, legioncommanders, were appointed by the Committee of the Paris Commune. 3). Theleaders of various sections and offices in the factories were appointed by the factorycouncils. In fact, Marx had acknowledged these kinds of appointments, “The police

75agents,instead of being agents of a central government,were tobe the servants of theCommune, having, like the functionaries in all the other departments ofadministration, to be appointed and always revocable by the Commune..*89 Butmany thinkers seemed to have missed this point. In this regard, Gao Fang did reveal along ignored aspect of the lessons of the Paris Commune and his explanation deservestobefurtherexplored.

The third distortion, Gao claimed, was that the “Gang of Four” misinterpretedthe principle of the Paris Commune's depending on the workers’ troops to realize theproletarian dictatorship,and the "Gang of Four” attempted to organize militia toreplace the PLA, namely, to wage a reactionary coup d'état. It is now clear that theanti-Gang-of-four forces that plotted a coup d'état at that time. But Gao's argumentthat in the face of threats by imperialist and hegemonist forces, the Chinese regulararmy should not be abolished, but instead needs to be further strengthened, is worthsoberconsideration.

Jin Chunming is a hardcore advocate of"thoroughly negating the CR" at theParty School of the Central Committee of CCP - an official “expert" on the CR forthe Deng Xiaoping and Hu Yangbang regime. Given credibility by the Hua Guofeng'sofficial verdict on the CR, Jin authored some early papers on the “JanuaryRevolution” and the Shanghai Commune. In his article “The Cause and Effect of theJanuary Revolution" published in 1983, Jin offered a rough sketch of the events of theShanghai CR in the decisive days of 1966 and 1967. In this article, Jin characterized89 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, p.206.

76the January Revolution as “not a revolution at any sense" and "without anyprogressive meaning". Yet he claimed that just as it is inappropriate to label the CR asa revolution or a counterrevolution, it is inappropriate to simply “throw a hat" (meansto give it a label) to the January Revolution,or even to define its nature.He offeredthefollowingreasons:

Firstly, it was improper to ascribe Shanghai power seizure to the conspiracy ofZhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and their group, because the power seizure, namely,"a great revolution of one class overthrowing another", was the basic officiallydesignated guideline of the CR. Jin's view, to some extent represents the officialverdict of the Deng Xiaoping regime, although it is different from that of the HuaGuofeng regime, which asserted that the Shanghai Commune was a conspiracy ofZhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and somebody else. Jin's second argument is that thepower seizure in Shanghai was supported and ratified by Mao Zedong himselfThirdly, Jin says that even though the power seizure in Shanghai was plotted andguided by a handful of people, such as Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and WangHongwen, not every concrete action was under their direction. The old Shanghaipowerholderseventookpartinsomeactions.Furthermore,if theJanuaryRevolutionwas termed as“counterrevolution,”since it hadinvolved severalhundred thousandpeople, should the post-Mao regime label all those people as counterrevolutionaries?The arguments and facts about the January Storm that Jin points out do have sometruth.My dissertation critiques Jin's contention that the old power holders did goocthings during the January Revolution. And I will discuss the historical initiatives of

77themasses.

Fourthly,the evaluation of theJanuaryRevolution is related to theissues ofhow one evaluates the character of society in Shanghai between 1967 and 1976, andthe role of various units with authority in the CR. If the Shanghai Commune waslabeled as a counterrevolutionary regime, it would then be hard to say that Shanghaicontinued to be socialist, since the Shanghai Commune and then the ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee lasted for more than 10 years. And if the ShanghaiCommune was labeled as a“counterrevolution,”this would then impact how onewould have to judge all the provincial regimes that modeled themselves on theexperiences of the power seizure in Shanghai. In conclusion, Jin decries the JanuaryRevolution as “utterly erroneous."He sees it as guided by a political line thatrepresented aleft deviationfromMaoZedong,and thatit involvedseriouscounterrevolutionary activities byZhangChunqiao,YaoWenyuan and others likethem.9° But Jin's evaluation and analysis of the January Revolution and the ShanghaiCommune is not always consistent. For example in this article he depicts the ShanghaiCommune as a "sheer fascist dictatorship of the bourgeoisie" 91

In 1986 Wang Nianyi, a Party historian with military rank at the PLA NationalDefense University wrote an article on the Shanghai CR entitled, “Some ViewpointsJin Chunming,Shanghai yiyue geming deqianqianhouhou(The Cause and Effct of theJanuary Revolution),collected in Wenhua dageming lunxi(Discussion and Analysis of the‘Great CR),Shanghai: Shanghai renminchubanshe, 1985.pp.111-113. Jin Chunming also wrote another article about January Revolution entitled “Yiyueduoquanwentimingbian(ClarifyingtheProblemsRelatedtotheJanuaryPowerSeizure)",inJinChunmingzixuan wenji (Jin Chunming's Selected Essays).

78Toward the Shanghai January Revolution". In this articleWang labels the JanuaryRevolution a "monster fetus" (guaitai), manufactured by Zhang Chunqiao, WangHongwen, and Jiang Qing. But he says the ultimate person responsible for this"monster fetus" was Mao Zedong, who was intoxicated with his left-deviationists andsubjectivist utopian view of socialism. According to Wang, the campaign to target andattack the reactionary capitalist line (zifan luxian) after August 1966 - encouraged bythe Maoist leadership -sharpened all kind of contradictions and threw the country intochaos. In the face of the stubborn resistance of the old Party and army cadres, and inorder to thoroughly carry out the CR to the end and fundamentally transform society,Mao had to rely on mobilizing the workers to seize power. For a while, this was aneffective way to break through the stalemate caused by the campaign of targeting andattacking the reactionary capitalist line.But when the workers rebelled, socialcontradictions were further intensified, making power seizures necessary. WangNianyi hence commented that “under the already chaotic circumstance across thewhole nation, Mao's call for power seizure was not a ^great strategic arrangement'but the only way out of the predicament, and a dead end as well.*92 For the JanuaryPower Seizure in Shanghai, Wang Nianyi emphasized what he saw as the “wickedfunction" that the “reactionary” Zhang Chunqiao played. In Wang's narrative, ZhangChunqiao's approach to the rebel workers can be seen in his willingness to grant theworkers' demands immediately after the Anting Incident. According to Wang, this“acting first and reporting afterwards"” attitude vividly demonstrated Zhang's92Wang Nianyi,Dui Shanghai“yiyue geming” de jidian kanfa (SomeViewpointsTowards the‘Shanghai JanuaryRevolution'), in Zhonggong dangshi yanjiu (The Studies of the History of CCP),No. 2,1986.

79"cattiness and cunning". 93When Zhang proposed to achieve“great unity” among therebels during the January Revolution, he was being a “crafty old scoundrel", since he“made a good conjecture of Mao's thinking". 94 And the methods Zhang Chunqiaoandhis fellowpartyleaders used to test whether or not thefirstPartysecretary ofShanghai, Chen Pixian, really supported rebels, revealed Zhang's "slyness, crueltyand acrimony"' 95 During its existence of over nine years, the Shanghai RevolutionaryCommittee, which came about as a result of the January Storm, according to WangNianyi, had carried out many evil acts."6 This verdict contradicts the assessment ofJin Chunming that the Shanghai regime during the CR was basically “"socialist" (eventhough Jin sometimes inferred that the Shanghai Commune was a fascist powerorgan).

In the mid 1980s, during the huge campaign to attack and defame the CR,some general history books (tongshi) of the CR, approved by the authorities, werepublished.Oneof thefirstsuchbookswasTen-YearHistoryof theGreatCulturalRevolution (Wenhua dageming shinian shi),byYanJiaqi and Gao Gao.This wasreleased in 1986, in both mainland China and Hong Kong and sold at least one millioncopies.97 The authors of this first authorized book on the history of the CR did not93For the detail of Zhang's action during Anting Incident, please go to the section of The Formation of WGH andtheAntingBattleinthethird chapterTheRiseof theShanghaiCommuneof this dissertation.94 Ibid.95 Wang Nianyi, Da dongluan de niandai (The Turbulent Decade), Zhengzhou: Henan renmin chubanshe, 1988,p.174.96 Wang Nianyi, 1988, p.183.97Mainlandsfirst Chinese editionwas published asWenhua dageming shinian shi Ten-Yearhistory of theGreatCultural Revolution) by Tianjing renmin chubanshe in 1986.Hong Kong's first Chinese edition was published asZhongguo"wenge"shinian shi(Ten-Year History of Chin's“Cultural Revolution")byXianggang Ta-Kung pao shein1986.Taiwan's revised Chinese edition was published as Wenhua dageming shinian shi(Ten-Year history of theGreat Cultural Revolution)byYuanLiuPublishing Co.of Taipeiin1990.And this bookhas twoEnglishtranslations.ThefirstEnglishversionTheTen-YearHistoryof theChineseCulturalRevolutionwas translated andpublished by Institute of Current China Studies of Taiwan in 1988,with a coverfull of bloodykilling scenes.ThesecondEnglishtranslation,based ontherevised Chineseedition andentitled“TurbulentDecade:AHistory of theCulturalRevolution”was translated and edited byD.W.Y.Kwok and published byUniversity of HawaiiPress in

80give much space to discussion of the Shanghai Commune. It has only a fewpages onthe January Storm, and the Shanghai Commune is only mentioned twice. Followingthe official verdict on the CR, the secction in this book on the CR in Shanghai putsforward that Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen, but not Mao, as arch “criminals"who let Shanghai fall into chaos. The Kangping Road Incident on the eve of theJanuary Storm, the first large-scale violence in Shanghai, was said to be incited byZhang Chunqiao."（On January 4, 1967, when Mao sent Zhang Chunqiao back toShanghai, Zhang was said to be “overjoyed with the assignment, as for many years hehad his eye on becoming the first secretary or mayor of Shanghai."99Thisbookisrepresentative of the typical writing style of Chinese history books about the CR -which employ fictional stories to bolster their attacks on the Cultural Revolution. Butstill, this book does disclose some facts about the Shanghai CR. For example, itclearlypoints out that theformation of the loyalist Scarlet Guards(chi wei dui)wasdone under the direct guidance of the SPC (Shanghai Party Committee). Cao Diqiu.the Shanghai mayor, proclaimed that the CCRG's (Central Cultural RevolutionaryGroup)“five articles"were“poisonous weeds" and encouraged the Scarlet Guards tobring Zhang Chunaiqo back to Shanghai.1o As for the wind of economism, the"Circular of the CCP CC Transmitting the Proposal by the Shanghai Party CommitteetoResolve theProblem of theSo-Called‘JanuaryRevolution'"and later official1996. Yan Jiaqi, a pro-multi-party system of capitalism activist, was a staff of “Political Reform Office”underPremier Zhao Ziyang between 1986 and 1987. After the June 4 Incident in 1989 he fled to U.S.A. as a Chinesepoliticaldissenter.98Yan Jiaqi and Gao Gao,"Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution", translated and edited by D.W.Y.Kwok,University of Hawai'i Press in 1996,p.379.99Yan Jiaqi and Gao Gao,1996,p.383.100YanJiaqi,GaoGao,TheTen-YearHistory of theChinese Cultural Revolution,translated and publishedbyInstitute of Current China Studies of Taiwan,1988,p.381.

81histories such as Ji Chunming's “Clarifying the Problems Related to the JanuaryPowerSeizure'101,, say that this was originally instigated by Zhang Chunqiao andother rebel leaders. In contrast to these viewpoints, Yan Jiaqi and Gao Gao stated thatamid the storm of power seizures by the rebels, many economist factions in Shanghaifelt discontented and subsequently initiated a storm of actions such as seizingresidences, demanding subsidies and other fees, redressing inadequate wages in thepast, and requesting promotion and higher payment, etc. This storm swept throughoutShanghai, and indeed the whole country, effectively disrupting production at variouslevels and damaging the communication and transportation networks as well. Yan andGao make it clear that the Shanghai rebels in fact did not want this “economism" tospread.102

Chen Shuping, a specialist in French history, wrote another important bookentitled TheParisCommune andChinain1988.Thisbookincludesthreechapters:the first is about the introduction of the Paris Commune in China in the late Qingperiod; the second is about the promotion and commemorations of the ParisCommune during the New Democratic Revolution Era (1919-1949); the third is aboutthe promotion and study of the Paris Commune during the socialist era (after 1949)This is the first and only book that deeply discusses the relationship between the ParisCommune and China. Unfortunately, the author taks the view that“to distort thehistorical lessons of the Paris Commune to serve certain political purposes has been a101JinChuming,“Yiyue duoquan wentimingbian (Clarifying theProblems Related tothe JanuaryPowerSeizure)",in Jin Chunming zixuan wenji (Jin Chunming's Selected Essays).Chengdu:Sichuan renmin chubansheJinJichun,ed.2002.102Ibid,p.385.

And the Shanghai Commune in 1967 is only mentioned once in hisbook.103

The Marxist Elegies to the Shanghai Commune in the West after 1976 Coup

The Shanghai Commune was neglected in the West for about 10 years (apartfrom scattered researche done by a handful of China specialists, such as MauriceMeisner and John Bryan Starr). But after the coup d'état in 1976 and the subsequenttotal negation of the CR by the Chinese regime, it was re-introduced into political andacademic discussions. These discussions on the Shanghai Commune were principallyconducted bypeoplewithvariousviewpointsfromwithin aMarxistpoliticalperspective.A major part of these arguments point out that the “failure” of the CRcould actuallybetraced back towhat they see as the“abandonment"of,or the"retreat" from, the Shanghai Commune in the spring of 1967 on Mao Zedong's orderIn May 1977 Charles Bettelheim resigned from his position as chairperson of theFranco-Chinese Friendship Association in protest of the Chinese coup d'état the yearbefore.After this Bettelheim wrote a long article “The Great Leap Backward", tosummarizethelessons of theCR.In this article,hedevotedonesection,“The103 Chen Shuping, Bali gongshe y zhonguo (The Paris Commune and China), Beijing: Zhongguo renmin daxuechubanshe,1988,p.184.

83Shanghai Commune: The Theoretical and Practical Implications of Its RapidDisappearance", to a critique of the “abandonment" of the Shanghai Commune which"possesses considerable importance, both theoretical and practical". When recallingcertain “facts” related to the Shanghai Commune, Bettelheim states that “in Shanghaias in other cities, the commune form, though it had been mentioned in thesixteen-point declaration,was dropped and replaced by that of the revolutionarycommittee.Noreal argument justifying this changehas everbeensetforth.A varietyof reasons have been given, mainly in Zhang Chunqiao's speech of February 24, inwhich he alluded to Mao Zedong's remarks on the creation of the ShanghaiCommune*104 It is true that The Sixteen-point Declaration specified that the newforms of organization of the masses emerging from the CR were supposed to“institute a system of general elections, like that of the Paris Commune” and were“organs of power of the Proletarian Cultural Revolution" (point 9). But it alsostipulated that the new forms of organization of the masses should be put under theleadership of the Communist Party.It does not seemlike theMaoist leadership evercalled for strictlyfollowing themodel of theParis Commune as it was orignally or inits entirety.What theMaoistleadership calledfor,instead,was tolearnfrom theprinciples of the Paris Commune, which Marx summarized as “the working classcannot simply layhold of the ready-made state machinery,and wield it for its ownpurposes."105And as Bettelheim attested, Mao himself never questioned theprinciples of the Paris Commune. But Bettelheim still bemoaned the nominal shift104 Charles Betelheim, Neill G Burton, China since Mao, Monthly Review Press, 1978, p.102.105 Karl Marx,Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, p.68.

84from theShanghai Commune to theShanghai Revolutionary Committee,whichaccording to him, implied “abandonment" of the Paris Commune model. Bettelheim'smainproof of this is was that the communeform had beenmentioned in theSixteen-Point Declaration,yet its name was changed at that time.But after a carefulreadingof theSixteen-pointDeclaration,onewouldfindthatinitsoriginaltext,theParis Commune was just considered as a model for instituting a system of generalelections within the mass organizations. Indeed, there was no clear evidence in thisdocument to show that the party, the regular army, the police and the bureaucracyshould be abolished -things which which Marx valued in the experience of the ParisCommune.

If Bettelheim only considered the Paris Commune a model in terms of theinstitution of general elections, he might be justified in his accusation that the nominalshift to the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee was an“abandonment"of the ParisCommune model, since the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee did not run a generalelection.ButitisdoubtfulthatthisisBettelheim'swholeconceptionoftheCommuneas a model. In any case, the Paris Commune cannot be simplified or reduced to meregeneralelections,becauseMarx,onthe onehand,claimed that"nothingcould bemore foreign to the spirit of the Commune than to supersede universal suffrage byhierarchicinvestiture,”andontheotherhandheadmittedthattheuniversalsuffragecould alsobe appropriated by thebourgeoisie todecide“oncein three orsixyearswhich member of the ruling class was to misrepresent the people.*106 In fact, even the106 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971,p.73.

85Paris Commune itself did not institute a complete general election in which allfunctionaries were elected by the masses. It is well know that all women in theCommune did not have the right to vote, and as Gao Fang has discussed, manypositions were actually appointed by the Commune authorities. Furthermore, a majorportionoftheParispopulationhad actuallyfled toVersaillesandotherplacesbeforethe general election of the Commune. As for the Shanghai Commune, it was neverclearly declared that it would institute a general election right away. Instead, iteffected a kind of delegation system which could not be equated to what Marxdescribed as “hierarchic investiture". That is, the power organs of the ShanghaiCommune consisted of delegates from various mass organizations that participated inthe Commune, and those delegates were usually elected or recommended by themembers of their own factions. Therefore, even though the Shanghai Commune didnot run a general election,most of its staff persons were democratically chosen bytheir own organizations. If one equates the Paris Commune model with generalelections, then, from the very beginning, the Shanghai Commune will be seen asdeviating from the Commune model, since it did not have a clear agenda for generalelections. In this regard, Bettelheim's view of the transformation of the ShanghaiCommune as a sign of the “abandonment" of the Commune model might besomewhat simplistic.And this analysis by Bettelheim also misses the nature andcontent of theShanghaiCommune.

Nevertheless, Bettelheim also tries to answer the question he himself raised:how did the revolutionary leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, who had

86supported the political form of the commune,recede,in practice,to their previousattitudes, claiming that China was not“ready”for this political form? How did theythereby open up a new course,which was tobe marked by a series of retreatsinterrupted by partial, but increasingly less effective, counteroffensives? To illustratethese questions, Bettelheim points to two sets of facts during the CR: First, variousrevolutionary organizations (in Shanghai and elsewhere)were apparently incapable ofuniting. Second is the negative reaction from the majority of party members at thehighest level that quickly developed in the beginning of 1967. I will elaborate onthese two sets of facts in Chapter 5. Bettelheim further suggested that “The unfoldingof events is not enough, however, to explain either this abandonment or the eventualdefeat of the revolutionary line. Explanation of these facts calls for the study of theproblem of the party's relations with the mass organizations, and especially withorganizations of the commune type, constituting organs of the power of the workingmasses." To argue this hypothesis, Bettelheim brings up Lenin, ^In 1919 Lenin noted,as a negative fact, that the Soviets were not, as they should have been, ^organs ofgovernment by the working people’but‘organs of government for the working peopleby the advanced section of the proletariat, but not by the working people as a whole.This situation was not destined to change, and led to the complete loss of power bythe Soviet working people."107But Bettelheim ends his quotation here and does notmention Lenin's further explanation for the reasons that triggered this situation. Infact,Lenin went on to state that“so far we have not reached the stage at which the107 Charles Bettelheim, Neill G Burton, China since Mao, Monthly Review Press, 1978, pp.103-107.

87workingpeople could participatein government"because of thelow culturallevel ofthe Russian working people. The way to resolve this problem was through“prolongededucation", and if the cultural level of the working people was not raised, thebourgeois type bureaucrats would occupy their old positions. Here Lenin is nothinting at abrogating the leadership of the Party. Rather, he is implying that one of theleading functions of the party is to educate the working people.lo8(ComparedtoLenin's views on the education of the working people, Mao stressed even more thepolitical training of the working people in the hope of fostering and consolidatingclass consciousness. In this sense, the main purpose of the CR was aimed atestablishing a working people's culture and proletarian hegemony at all spheres ofsociety, especially in terms of ideology.

Similar comments on the Shanghai Commune were made in numerousposition articles by various radical groups in the wake of the Chinese coup d'étatSam Marcy, a Marxist critic and the founder of the Workers World Party in U.S.Awrote abook,publishedin1977andentitledChina:TheSuppressionoftheLeft.Thisbook, which evaluates the lessons of the Chinese CR, discusses the significance of theShanghai Commune as “It is impossible to understand the later defeat of the left andthe current ascendency of the rightist forces unless we examine, even if only inoutline form, the meaning of the Shanghai Revolution, the subsequent development ofthe Shanghai Commune, and its supersession by the Triple Alliance.*109Marcybelieves that the Shanghai Commune was not “something that the left-wing leadership108 V.1. Lenin, Eighth Congress of the R.C.P. (B.) March 18-23, 1919, in Lenin's Collected Works, 4th EnglishEdition,ProgressPublishers,Moscow,1972,Volume 29,p.183..09Sam Marcy, China: The Suppression of the Left,World View Publishers (1977), p.38.

88had set up against Mao or went beyond Mao, but was a practical application of whatwas codified in a principal party directive." The Shanghai Commune “spread terror inthe camp of the rightist revisionist forces", who put up strong opposition to theCommune. Consequently, even though the Commune idea “held out the prospect ofeventually dislodging the rightist forces", it was superseded by the Triple Alliancefavored by Mao. Marcy argues that Mao's reasoning for superseding the Communeswith the TripleAlliance did not lend itself to credibility.With regard toMao'sreasoning that “the working class was still being split and divided, it had to clarify itsideology and unite. There were still seven hundred or more organizations inShanghai's factories which were not yet in the Commune,” Marcy holds that with thehelp of the Central Party leaders, the support for the Commune would have beenconsiderably broadened.Marcy also does not subscribe toMao's claim that theCommune-type power organ was not able to cope with the counter-revolutionaryefforts, or that the Commune would succumb to anarchism or Bonapartism

A more interesting exploration by Marcy is his examination of the basicdifference between the Shanghai Commune and the ensuing Triple Alliance. The firstmajor difference, Marcy points to is that the Triple Alliance, as a coalitiongovernment, was restricted to three forces in the struggle: mass organizations, thearmy, and party cadres whereas the Commune was based on the workers, peasants.and masses of the people. The Triple Alliance, therefore, narrowed the participation ofthe broad masses compared to that of the Commune.Another fundamental differencewas that the TripleAlliance owed its structure of composition,first of all,to the

89forging of a coalitionfrom the topwhereas the Communepresupposed elections bythe broad masses and theinstitutionalization of thisform as thebasicwayforconsummating a proletarian democracy. The third difference based on this, in contrastto Mao's view, was that the Commune could dislodge the rightist forces much moreeffectively than theTripleAlliance,whichleft thedoor wideopenfor therightistrevisionist, bureaucratic, and elitist elements, as long as they pretended to claim thatthey were in favor of Mao Zedong's line. Moreover, in a Commune-type organizationthe entire administrative apparatus, including the party, was subjected to the will ofthe Commune, while under the Triple Alliance, no matter how hard the revolutionaryelements strived, Marcy held, the intractable, elitist managerial and governmentalapparatuswould return to positions of authority.110

Still some other radical factions, such as the Progressive Labor Party (PLP)though pro-Mao in its initial stage, have denounced Mao Zedong and his followers forwhat they refer to as Mao's “crushing"of the Shanghai Commune. PLP's article‘Shanghai Workers Won't be Stopped", commemorating the tenth anniversary of theShanghai Commune, characterized the Shanghai Commune as directed against “theMaoist system of new democracy”and a state form“more in keeping with thesocialist economic base."Mao is depicted as a revisionist traitor of the communistcause:As one of the communist movement's"most skilled centrists",Mao should beheld responsible for the revisionist tendency in Chinese society in the 17 years beforethe CR and the later treachery of workers' struggle during the CR.

When Zhang Chunqiaosided with the rebel workers in the upsurge, he was portrayed as performing a'good-cop bad-cop" ploy with the workers, and "they [Zhang Chunqiao and otherMaoists] took the side of the workers as a gambit tolead them into the hands of thebourgeoisie. Once they had served their purpose for the capitalists, they werethemselves discarded." When the spate of economism flooded into Shanghai andvirtually bankrupted and paralyzed the city, PLP says that "Mao and his gang'"dropped their centrist subtlety” and moved to crush the rebellion. Mao's initialendorsement of the Commune, the PLP explains, merely demonstrated Mao'sintention to set up a new state, “different in form but essentially similar in contentreplacing his own enemies with loyal aides, and making it appear to the workers that amore profound change had taken place." Shanghai workers, according to PLP'snarrative,decided toform a Commune which decisively broke awaywith the newdemocratic type state set up by the revolution of 1949. Yet after a while, theCommune was replaced by the Triple Alliance due to Mao's "attack"of the Commune.Thereason why the Shanghai workers were defeated in their fight to maintain theCommune lay in the fact that the vast majority of them"failed to perceive Mao as arevisionist” due to the fatal personality cult. Therefore, “"the actions of the Shanghaiworkers in January 1967 stand as the first great rebellion against modern revisionism",

WesternChinaScholars'RediscoveryoftheShanghaiCommune

After the coup d'état in 1976, especially with China's Open-Up policy in 1978and with the major shift in the general evaluation of the CR in China, similar shiftsalso took place in the circles of China studies in the West. The ensuing Reform Era inChina enabled a major portion of Chinese specialists to switch their focus of researchfrom the CR to the Reform. The Western China specialists who remained on the trackof CR studies, thereafter, began to challenge previous “mainstream” interpretations ofthe CR in the West that had allegedly been influenced by the official and radicalChinese narratives during the CR. The views of these Western China scholars.however, more or less, echoed the new and sometimes 180-degree reverse assessmentof the CR by the Hua Guofeng and Deng Xiaoping regimes after 1976.As for thestudies of the Shanghai CR, not coincidently, many Western studies echoed theofficial Chinese reassessment of the CR.Andrew Walder, a China specialistpublishedabook,ChangChun-ch'iao(ZhangChunqiao)andShanghai'sJanuaryRevolution in 1978.Theoretically set in an analyticalframework of organizational.social structure and conflict, Walder's research on the Shanghai CR is aimed attoppling the “single theme" in the Western writings on the CR in Shanghai: that theJanuary Revolution was a victory of the revolutionary rebels over an entrenchedI1 PLP pamphlet “China - The Reversal of Socialism: How the "Gang of Four" Betrayed the Left During theCulturalRevolution",1976.

92municipal bureaucracy activelyresisting and/or suppressing the emerging movementHe rebuffs two assertions of previous writings: that the Scarlet Guards colluded withthe SPC (Shanghai Party Committee) to oppose the revolutionary rebels, and that the"economism"” and the ensuing economic breakdown of the city in early January 1967was a deliberate attempt by the SPC to sabotage the CR and preserve its power.Moreover, he challenges the portrayal of the deposed Mayor Cao Diqiu as repressiveand Zhang Chunqiao as a “radical ideologue"who assisted the rebel struggle in orderto create a democratic commune in Shanghai."i² By overemphasizing the pivotal roleof Zhang Chunqiao and downplaying the initiative of the masses, Walder assertes thatthe January Revolution was“not a power seizure by workers’organizations ofmunicipal administration from a recalcitrant group of Party officials but an effortorganized by Zhang Chunqiao to bring mass political action under control and torestore the normal operation of Shanghai's economy."Such a conclusion,no matterhow Walder tries to justify it, is similar to the official Chinese verdict after the coupd'état that the Shanghai January Revolution was“not a revolution in any sense", andthat Zhang Chunqiao was an arch criminal who manipulated the movement inShanghai. In addition, when Walder charges that it was the CCRG (Central CulturalRevolutionary Group) itself, not the old power holders, such as Cao Diqiu, thatperformed the crime of economisim,113 he enforces the official Chinese verdictagainst the so-called"Gang of Four”ontheissue ofeconomism.

Walder's accusation of the CCRG on economism, given the historical112Walder,AndrewC.,Chang ChunCh'ioZhang Chunqiao]and Shanghais January Revolution,AnArbor:Center for ChineseStudies,the University of Michigan,1978,pp.1-2.113Ibid.p.48.

93evidence he provides, however, is not historically grounded.l14 Nonetheless, thecontributionofWalder ontheissue ofeconomismintheShanghaiJanuaryStormliesin his in-depth study on thesocial and historical origins of the wind of economism onthe part of the economist mass organizations. This is echoed in the book,ProletarianPower:ShanghaiintheCulturalRevolution,byElisabethPerryandXunLipublishedin 1997.

Inadditiontotheissueofeconomism,anothercentralclaimofWalder,thatMayor CaoDiqiu actively supported the CR movement and adhered to the CCRGpolicies, and was unwilling to suppress the masses, is not very convincing as well. Itis true that Cao did support a specific kind of "movement", that is, the conservativestudent and workers movement, not the rebel one, acting just like his counterparts didin other places during the CR. Compared to his counterparts elsewhere, Cao mighthave openly designated fewer pro-CR activists as“counterrevolutionary".But therewere still more than a few people in Shanghai, overtly or covertly, who were treatedas ^counterrevolutionary" under his leadership, as he later admitted in hisconfession.115 Walder's claim that the Shanghai Commune was neither distinctively“‘radical" nor unrealistically“utopian" might be controversial. But his argument thatthe Shanghai Commune “relied heavily upon the PLA for its very survival" and that it114 See “Bureaucratized Strikes and the Spate of Economism" in Chapter 4.115SeeCaoDiqiuCaDiqi d janhaCaDiqju'elfCriticism）March121966.Frmhttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=12215 cited on Dec. 13, 2009.

ElizabethPerry is one of therespectable China scholars who emerged in theWest after the Mao era. In 1997, together with one Chinese collaborator, PerrypublishedProletarianPower:Shanghaiin theCultural Revolutionwhich dealswiththe issue of Shanghai workers’ power. This book, which utilizes various archivalsources: factory surveys, classified government and party reports, transcripts ofworker roundtable discussions, handbills issued by worker organizations, backgrounddata on rebel leaders, and Public Security Bureau confessions, as well as firsthandinterviews with key participants, covers the period from the turbulent days of the CRto the death of Mao Zedong, a topic that has been relatively less popular amongmainstream Western scholars for quite a long time. In this book, Perry maintains that"'the remarkable political activism displayed by ordinary citizens during the course ofthat movement served to discredit the prevailing totalitarian model and to engendernew approaches that assigned greater influence to social forces." In her book, shesummarizes three representative paradigms in the West in interpreting the CR as asocialand politicalmovement:FranzSchurmann,HongYungLee,and Stanley Rosenwhose emphasis is on socioeconomic interest groups,focusing on grievances; AndrewWalder and others on clientelist networks, focusing on organizations; and Lucian Pye.Richard Solomon et al on psychocultural orientations, focusing on identities.117 In herbook, Perry argues that all of these considerations are relevant. In addressing the three116 Walder, Andrew C.,1978, pp.60-61.117 Perry,Elisabeth andLi,Xun,Proletarian Power: Shanghai in the CR,WestviewPress,1997,pp.3-4,p.189.

95facets ofworking class activism,thatis,rebellion,conservatism,and economismPerry comprehends them in all of these analytical traditions. She argues that thePye-Solomon mode has much to tell us about the leadership of the rebels whoattacked particular party authorities and that party networks are essential fonunderstanding the conservatives who defended the authorities.As for the economistfactions, Perry's view is that it is better to understand them from the conventionalemphasis on group characteristics."1° Through her exhaustive study of Shanghaiworkers’ activism during the CR, Perry finds that “Maoist state initiatives, rather thanstifling the possibility of collective dissent, served to structure mass activism intoidentifiable patterns of association promoted by different types of local leaders.'Therefore, while she shares the common premise that China (even after 1976) hasbeen a socialist and communist state with some scholars, such as Zhou Xueguang andDaniel Kelliher, Perry effectively challenges their view that the Chinese popularprotest was amorphous and disorganized in the face of an arrogant state power.119 Inaddition to this theoretical contribution,Perry also refutes the popular idea that themass organizations during the CR were nothing more than elite-sponsored instrumentsforperpetratingterror,and thattheworkingpeoplegainednothingbutfurtherrepression from their involvement in the whole sorry enterprise of the CulturalRevolution.Perry states that the workers’political status and their class consciousness.not only in Shanghai, but also in the whole country, were markedly elevated owing tothe CR. For example,“the^iron rice bowl' privileges enjoyed by the state workers118Ibid.pp. 4-5.119 Ibid. p.5, pp.194-196.

96appeared tohave been strengthened during the CR,withfewer punishments meted outfor infractions of rules or poor on-the-job performance and greater latitude forworkplace freedom;workers and their children were nowfavored in the universityadmissions, government employment, and as marriage partners; the visible careeradvancement of the old rebels served to instill a sense of political efficacy among theworking class."And so on and so forth.12° From this perspective, we can discern thatit is groundless to consider the replacement of the Commune-type power organs withthe Revolutionary Committees as a clearly failed project. Yet Perry holds that therebel worker leaders were more concerned with their personal political endeavors thanthe welfare of the ordinary workers,and that the common workers'plight,i.e.theactual living condition, was noticeably deteriorating. Perry's view, I believe, needs tobe further substantiated and explored. At least, as we know, the system of contract andtemporary laborers was officially abolished in the later stages of the CR, and thoselaborers were turned into full-time workers. Their situation obviously improved. Butevenif thetheworkers'situationdiddeteriorate,thishastobeseeninlightofthehistorical significance of the efforts by the Maoist leadership and conscious rebelleaders to narrow the big gap in China between the cities and the countryside, andbetween the workers and the peasants. Given that the general socioeconomic status ofthe workers was better than that of the peasants, measures that put a priority on thewelfare of workers inevitably undermined or even jeopardized the worker-peasantalliance,andthereforetheworkers'ruleinMaoistChina.120 Ibid.pp.192-193.

In 1998, Perry published an interesting article titled "From Paris to the Paris ofthe East and Back: Workers as Citizens in Modern Shanghai'', that discusses fourpolitical confrontations in Shanghai that have changed the face of modern ChinaThese movements are: the May Fourth Movement of 1919, the Three ArmedUprisings of 1926-27, the Shanghai Commune in 1967, and the June Fourth Incidentof 1989. All of these events involved the crucial participation of the working classAmong these four events, the Three Armed Uprisings and the Shanghai Commune of1967 were heavily influenced by the Paris Commune. The “ill-fated" ShanghaiCommune in 1967, Perry held, demonstrated an effort to empower the proletariat inthe local government and is an embodiment of the political experimentation duringthe CR. Perry differs from the Marxist analysis of the Shanghai Commune, in that sheinsists that despite the rebels’rhetorical embrace of “class struggle,”the ShanghaiCommune, resonating with the earlier experiments in citizen rule such as theRepresentative Congress of Shanghai in 1927, was just a bid for political inclusion (or"citizenship"), rather than a battle against an “already moribund bourgeoisie". In allthese events,Perry points out that there had been a noteworthy tendency for theworkers to downplay their own particular demands in favor of more universalisticclaims, and to subordinate workplace grievances in favor of playing the role ofcitizens. She also discusses the worker-student relationship in these movements, andnotes not only the national significance of these movements, but also theirinternational implications that extended beyond the borders of China.“One of themore arresting, yet relatively unexplored, features of modern protest movements,

98Perry commentes,“is their tendency to erupt with remarkable simultaneity in differentcountries." Each of these movements was also part of a larger transnational process.OnFebruary 6,1967,a handbill hailing the inauguration of the Shanghai Communeentitled “The country is ours; political power is ours" proclaimed the founding of theShanghai Commune as “a great beginning that stirs the world". Perry argues that thisclaim was not empty hyperbole and their “newParis Commune"did have globalsignificance.

The outbreak of the Cultural Revolution in China helped to triggerwidespread popular protest around the world. In 1968, massdemonstrations erupted in the United States, Italy, Germany, Japan,Ireland,Czechoslovakia,andPoland.Butnonewasmore dramatic thanthe May Revolt in Paris.For the first time since the Commune of 1871,Parisians in1968 erected barricades in the center of their city as part ofa massive political protest.Participants were conscious not only oftheir own national revolutionary heritage, but also of contemporaryevents elsewhere around the world, especially in China....Globalinteractions seemed to have come full circle. A Chinese revolutionsparked half a century earlier by European influences was now itselfservingtoinspirewould-berevolutionaries inEurope.121

In the end, Perry was confident that “when the next global protest cycle getsunderway we may well find ourselves looking to the Paris of the East for yet a newchapter in worker-citizen rule.*122

AlainBadiou is a major thinker who advocates restoring the"politicalvisibility”of the Commune model, including both the Paris Commune and theShanghai Commune. In favoring a process of “dis-incorporation"—— rupture with theparliamentaryLeft,Badiouassertsthat"itmustbeextractedfromtheleftisthermeneutics[of Commune] thathave overwhelmed it for solong.123SSuch"Leftists" are referred to by Badiou as “a set of parliamentary political personnel",that "has now fallen so low that it no longer even makes a pretence of rememberingthe Commune." The moral and political falling of such “leftist" originates from theirinstinctive fear and loathing of any authentic social revolution, especially violent ones.The treachery of the PCF in May 1968 was no more than a footnote of such “leftist'intervention.124 To remember the Paris Commune, for Badiou, is to reactivate therevolutionary potentiality and momentum inscribed in it. During the CR, andespecially between 1966 and 1972,Badiou holds that the Paris Commune wasreactivated, leading to the formation of the Shanghai Commune in January 1967 andthe gigantic centennial commemoration of the Paris Commune in China in 1971.125

While consistently acclaiming the activation and realization of the spirit of theParis Commune in China during the CR, Badiou's interpretation of the ShanghaiCommune, the ensuing Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, and the CR as a wholehas undergone changes over time. In 1976, Badiou stated that the Shanghai workerspractice of the“workers'commune” slogan in 1967,“returns to the practicalhistorical, inexhaustibility of the Paris Commune"; and at the same time, "the positive123 Badiou, Alain, Winter, Cecile, Polemics, Verso, 2006, p. 273.124 Badiou, Alain, Winter, Cécile, 2006, pp.270-273.125 Ibid.p.266.

100development of this slogan,in thenewform of the three-in-onerevolutionarycommittee, carries this return forward.*126 Obviously, Badiou praised both theShanghaiCommuneanditssuccessortheShanghaiRevolutionaryCommitteeasembodying the principles of the Paris Commune. Yet no later than 2003 Badioumoved in the direction of favoring the Shanghai Commune over the ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee. In his article “The Cultural Revolution: The LastRevolution',Badiou puts forward that the shift from the Commune to theRevolutionary Committee was *by no means insignificant"*,127and that even the titleof the “revolutionary committee” was “indistinct128 aand ambiguous, for" committe? has always been the name for the provincial or municipal partyorgans."129But we could ask, what Badiou would think of the title of the“Revolutionary Committee", if the purpose of the CR had nothing to do withdemolishing the Party? Nevertheless, Badiou correctly pointed out that the nominalshift of the new power organ from February onwards revealed that it was ^the impureproduct of thepolitical conflict".But Badiou's elaboration on such impurityis notaccurate or comprehensive. On the one hand, Badiou believes that “for the localrevolutionaries, it is a matter of substituting a different political power for the party.after the nearly complete elimination of the old leading cadres."Nonetheless,eventhough the majority of the old leading cadres were eliminated from the new powerorgans in different localities amid the January Storm, the extent of exclusion varied in126 Alain Badiou,The Flux and theParty:In the Margins of Anti-Oedipus, in Polygraph,No15-16,DukeUniversity,2004,p.77.27Alain Badiou, Cecile Winter, Polemics, Verso, 2006, p.311.128 Alain Badiou, Cecile Winter, 2006, p. 267.129 Ibid. p.311.

101different places. Shanghai might have been one of the places with the most instancesof the removal of old leading cadres. But the Shanghai Commune still had ZhangChunqiao andYaoWenyuan,tworepresentatives of oldParty cadres from theCCRGwho symbolized the Party leadership. In addition, the Shanghai Commune contained agreat number of middle-lower Party cadres who had participated in rebellions andformed the Jilianzhan, and who worked very well in helping with the operation of thenew power organ. Moreover, out of the fear of being labeled as “anti-Party", almostevery rebel organization tried its best toinstall Party members as its leaders. It is truethat there did exist a tendency among some rebels to “kick aside the Party committeesand leave the Revolution to the masses"(tikai dangwei nao geming).But thePartycommittees that were kicked out were limited to local civil ones, not military ones.nor ones of the Central Committee of the CCP. Historically speaking, there werevirtually no rebels who called for abolishing the whole Party in 1966 and in thebeginning of1967.130

On the other hand,for the conservatives,Badiou holds,it is a matter of‘putting back in place the local cadres after the mere fiction of a critique." It is truethattheconservativemassestendedtoprotectthelocaloldcadresmostlyout ofstrong reverence, trust, and love for the Party. But seldom would they defend thoseold cadres who were disclosed by the rebels as responsible for serious crimes, such asbeing traitors of the revolution in war time, or cadres who were major targets ofstruggle named by the Central Committee of CCP. Though the criticism of the old130 The representative manifesto Whither China by Hunan “ultra-leftist' Yang Xiaokai, calling for estabishing a“Chinese People's Commune”modeled upon theParis Commune,did hint at abolishing the current CCP,but itactually proposed to form a new party based on Maoism, or more precisely, it suggested to reconfigure the Party.

102cadres by the conservatives might have been milder than that of the rebels,in mostcases, the critiques were constructive and by no means unsubstantiated.131 Partlybecause of this, Deng Xiaoping proclaimed after the CR that both factions, rebel andconservative,hadmadeerrors.AsfortheMaoistnationalleadership,Badiouremarksthat“it is a matter of defining the stakes for the revolutionary organizations (the'seizing of power’) and of inspiring a lasting fear in their adversaries, all the whilepreserving the general framework for the exercise of power, which remains in their

In Badiou's explanation, the other twoeyes the party and the party alone.components within the triple combination, i.e. the army and the mass organs, and thetwo rivalries among the mass organs, i.e. rebel and conservative factions, were takenout from the horizon of the Maoist national leadership. And what is left out is thedialectical relationship between the Party and the mass organs, as well as the law oftheunityoftheopposites

Badiou's distrust of the revolutionary committees comes from his different andmutating attitudes toward the party-state.As early as 1976,Badiou believed that“eachgreat revolt of the working and popular masses sets them invariably against the StateEach revolt takes position against one power and in the name of another, of onethought as a step toward the dilution of the state.Each extensive revolt, across itsspecific contents (the school, the country,factory hierarchy),is an anti-stateproposition". At the same time,he valorized the role of the party in the process of131 Neverthelss, sometimes the loyalist factions would struggle very hard with the old Partycadres who supportedthe rebels.For example,inLankao county of He'nanProvince,ZhangQinli,a close friend of model Maoistrevolutionary cadres JiaoYulu and a supporter of rebels,were under harsh treatment,includingbeatings,by theloyalistfactionwei donglinjiao.SeeLaoTian,AnOralHistoryof theCRinLankao,He'nan(He'nanLaokanwengekoushu shi)athttp://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class14/200608/8958.html,cited onDec.12,2009.132Alain Badiou,Cecile Winter,Polemics,Verso,2006,p.311.

103diluting and dissolvingof thestate,“Thepartydirects thewitheringofwhatit mustdirect (the State, the separation of politics)." In this process, “the mass movementengages in a necessary dialectic with the State. Between the two there is no continuity,but rather unity of opposites. If the State is a proletarian State, the contradiction canbe of the non-antagonistic type. If it is a State of exploiters, the contradiction isantagonistic at heart."133 In his article “The Cultural Revolution: The LastRevolution"published in 2003,Badiou held that the CR is “the typical example (yetanother notion from Maoism, the typical example: a revolutionary discovery that mustbe generalized) of a political experience that saturates the form of the party-state,” and"'the last significant political sequence that is still internal to the party-state (in thiscase, the Chinese Communist Party), and fails as such." The positive aspect of the CRis in fact extracted from its negative lessons: “without the saturation of the sixties andthe seventies, nothing would asyet be thinkable, outside the spectre of the party-stateor the parties-state.*134 In 2006 in Logic of Worlds, Badiou went on to proclaim thedecisive failure of the Shanghai Commune, the CR, and the paradigm of revolution,

For the sake of all of the world's revolutionaries,the CR effectivelyexplored thelimits of Leninism.It taught us that the politics ofemancipation can no longer work under the paradigm of revolution,nor remain prisoner to the party-form. Symmetrically, it cannot beinscribed in the parliamentary and electoral apparatus.

104the affirmativerealization of thisbeginning.But theirfurywas still soenmeshed in what they were rising up against that they only exploredthis beginning from the standpoint of pure negation.135

By the same token,with a perspective of the Badiou type paradigm of theparty-state, Slavoj Zizek attempts to construe the Shanghai Commune as a"momentary utopian explosion"

The Shanghai commune is said tohave beenaimed at “getting rid of the party-state apparatus itself and replacing it with communalself-organization.*137 Zizek elaborates,

In spite of (or, rather, because of) all its horrors, the CR undoubtedlydid contain elements of an enacted utopia.At its very end,before theagitationwas blocked byMaohimself(sincehehad by then achievedhis goal of re-establishing his influence and getting rid of the topnomenklatura competitors), there was the “Shanghai Commune": onemillion workers who simply took the official slogans seriously,demanding the abolition of thestate and even thepartyitself,and thedirect communal organization of society. It is significant that it was atthis very point that Mao ordered the army to intervene and to restoreorder. The paradox is that of a leader who triggers an uncontrolledupheaval,while trying to exert full personal power—the overlapping ofextreme dictatorship and extreme emancipation of the masses.138

Here, I want to point to some missing points in Zizek's narrative. Firstly, therewas, if any, only a tiny handful of rebels who, in proposing the formation of theShanghai Commune, had vague ideas and intentions of demanding the abolition of thestate and the party. Amid the storm of power seizure, nearly all Shanghai rebelsfocused their efforts on the local Shanghai affairs, not those of the whole state.Secondly, among the two million Shanghai workers, even if one million of them were135 Alain Badiou, Logics of worlds, translated by Alberto Toscano, London: Continuum, p.518.136 Slavoj Zizek, First As Tragedy, Then As Farce, Verso, 2009, p.148.137Zizek,InDefense of Lost Causes,erso, 2008,p.1.138 Zizek, 2008, p.207.

105demanding the direct communal organization of the society,therewerestill anotherone million taking different political positions, let alone numerous common Shanghaicitizens. It is hard to imagine that a Paris Commune as workers' power would havebeen established if theVersailles people, who fled from Paris,were still in themetropolis. (This is a somewhat awkward analogy, of course, as the Shanghai peoplein 1967 who did not support the communization of society should not be regarded astheVersailles people in1871). Similarly, Mao's support of the CR by no meansmerely aimed at getting rid of the top nomenklatura competitors and restoring his“lost’ personal power. Not at all. Mao would have never hesitated to give up onreduce his personal power if that was good for the revolution. At one point, before theGreat Leap Forward, Mao had proposed that he retire. Mao's real purpose was toempower the people.And if Mao had really meant to execute “extreme dictatorship",he would not have initiated the CR-style mobilization of the masses to begin withThe initial aim of dispatching troops during the Shanghai January Revolution was notto execute“extreme dictatorship” and to restore order, but to assist the Left in seizingpowerfrom theoldpower holderswhoweretakingthecapitalistroad.

Doubtful of the popular conception that Mao's opposition to the ShanghaiCommune revealed his ruthless manipulation of the rebel movements, Zizek surmisesthat Mao might have been “aware that the very flourishing of movements of themultitude always-already had to rely on some dispositif of Power which structuresand sustains the very space within which they operate."And deducing from Badiou'sinterpretation of the CR, Zizek argues that the lesson of the CR lies in the

106impossibilityofpursuingradicalpoliticsfromorwithintheframeworkoftheparty-state. “"So neither can we practice revolutionary politics outside the party-stateframework, nor can we do it within this framework."139 zZizekhenceintroducesanother“more fundamental reproach"for his criticism of Mao and the traditional“Leninist Marxists, which is formulated by the postmodern Left such as JohnHolloway14°: that they all focus on state power, on taking over state power. A “muchmore radical" strategy than that of Mao, in taking such a postmodern position, is to"withdraw from state power and focus on directly transforming the very texture ofsocial life, everyday practices which sustain the entire social structure."141Believingthat there is a moment of truth in this approach, Zizek maintains that the failure of theCR was precisely the failure to create a new form of everyday life, because itremained a carnivalesque excess, with the state apparatus (under Zhou Enlai's control)guaranteeing the reproduction and maintenance of everyday life and production.142

Since they reach these conclusions mainly from the lessons of the CR as“thelast revolution", especially those of the Shanghai Commune, in order to further justifytheir claim of unthinking of the revolution from or within the framework of so-calledparty-state,Badiou and Zizek need to explore the following questions deeper: Woulda proletarian party be monolithic, without line struggles within the party? Were theCCPbeforetheCRandbetween1967and1976thesame?Canthepre-CRChinesestate machine and the one between 1967 and 1976 be equated to the “party-state" in139Zizek,In Defense of Lost Causes,Verso, 2008, p.4.140 John Holloway, Change the World without Taking Power, Pluto Press, 2005.141 Zizek, 2008, pp.371-372.142 Zizek, 2008, p.205.

107thesameway?Ifthe“failure"ofthefirstCRcouldbeused toprovetheineffectiveness of the party-state, why did Mao, in the unfolding of the CR, predictthat there would be more rounds of CRs in the future under the dictatorship of theproletariat?143 As we know, the Paris Commune did not abolish the capitalist systemof private property. Given the current situation of intensified class struggle on a globalscale, is it possible to practice the politics of emancipation for the working peoplewithout seizing state power and abolishing the system of private property? In otherwords, how can the capitalist means of production be abolisehd without theintervention of a proletarian state?Moreover, how can the communist orientation ofthe politics of emancipation be insured without communist-oriented parties, or someentities similar to parties, no matter what label they are given? As Badiou sometimescomplains “Does the working class have a heart? Today, in any case, little [about theParis Commune] is remembered, and badly so."144Whenthemajority ofworkingpeople who are doing material or immateriallabor in a class and socially dividedsociety have no idea of the Paris Commune, that is, communist-oriented politics, is itpossiblefor themajorityofthepopulationtoreachaconsensusofpoliticsofemancipationbased on“egalitarianmarxim"?Before a decisiveworldrevolutionengulfs the whole globe, at least in some of the most powerful countries, is it possibleto abolish all of the state apparatus such as the standing army, the system of143 Mao said: The present great Cultural Revolution is only the first; there wilinevitably be many more in thefuture....theissue of who will win in the revolution can onlybe settled over a long historical period.If things arenot properly handled, it is possible for a capitalist restoration to take place at any time.It should not be thought byanyParty member or any one of the people in our country that everything will be all right after one or two greatcultural revolutions,or even three or four.We must be very much on the alert and never losevigilance.”See TheEditorialDepartments of Hongqi andRenminribao,"A GreatHistoricalDocument"(weida delishiwenjian),May18, 1967, in Peking Review, No.21, May 19, 1967.Mao's words were put in boldface.144AlainBadiou,Cecile Winter,Polemics,Verso,2006,p.257.

108bureaucracy,etc.withina socialist country?DoesBadiou's communistvisionbasedon the Commune imply an untimely theoretical hypothesis before any actual worldrevolutionof abolishingprivateproperty?

Raymond Lotta, a Maoist economist, together with two other scholars, hasspecifically criticized Badiou's views on the Shanghai Commune. Badiou argues thatthe “authentically revolutionary sequence is to be found only in its initial segment(1965-8) [of the CR]", and that the mass upheavals overthrew oppressive party andstate authority and created new structures challenging and transcending the party-statesystem. Yet unfortunately, these political efforts were curbed and suppressed owing toMao's insistence of the party-state authority. This kind of interpretation of the CRLotta argues, is not original at all,

It has been articulated in various permutations by progressive Chinascholars like Maurice Meisner. It was taken up by currents ofinternational Maoism, especially in France in the late 1960s, andsubsequently by intellectuals like French political economist CharlesBettelheim.Not least, in the CR itself, some Red Guard formationsadvocated that the CR would succeed if and only if it became afull-scale assault on all cadre and existing structures of power.145

Badiou'sconceptionthat theShanghai Communewassomethingapproachingunmediated democracy, a declaration of"maxim of equality", and a break-out fromthe party-state framework, according to Lotta, is greatly misleading.

On the one hand, he suggests that a broad democracy was taking hold

frombelow,empoweringbyvirtue ofitsmass,egalitarian(classless)145 AlainBadiou's “Politics of Emancipation": A Communism Locked Within the Confines of the Bourgeois WorldbyRaymond Lotta,Nayi Duniya,andK.J.A.,fromhttp://www.demarcations-journal.org/issue01/demarcations_badiou.html,cited onOctober8,2009.

109character——when in fact this great mass upsurge and ferment, whichwas indeed a profound expression of mass democracy, also containeddifferentsocialandclassforcesandagendas.Ontheotherhand,Badiou counterposes to this idealized mass movement a monolithic(classless) party-state structure—-oppressive by virtue of its specializedfunctions and powers—when infact, as wehave seen,twopoliticaland ideological lines and headquarters representing different classinterests were contending within the party. And the contending agendaswould (and did) have radically different social outcomes, in terms ofthe direction of society and in terms of which class would actually rulesociety.146

As“the party was an object of struggle and transformation in the course of theGPCR and went through a great deal of change during this period'", Lotta contendsthatBadiou's complaint about thereplacement of the Commune and the reassertion ofthe party's leading role is without merit. Lotta holds that while distorting the practicalhistory of the Shanghai Commune and Mao's analysis of the limitations of theCommune form, Badiou idealizes the Shanghai Commune by papering over thecomplexities and problems of the Commune experiment itself. In counteringBadiou'sidealizing of the Commune and his rejection of the role of the party, state structures,and leaders in mediating emancipatory politics, Lotta holds that Badiou's “egalitarianmaxim" conceals class contradictions and cannot rise above particular interests. First,'the inequalities and differences in socialist society need to be recognized and actedon, and this requires a certain kind of vanguard leadership and a certainkind of statepower." Second, if the Commune-type local, quasi-autonomous self-governingdemocracy becomes the essential political framework and ideological horizon fordecision-making, then the development of larger entities than given communes—in asociety and world marked by profound inequality— will be severely affected, with146Ibid.

110greater possibilities for a negative outcome. In a class society, “These are examples ofsome of the crucial questions that, by their very nature, cannot be solved on a narrowlocal basis. Spontaneity left to itself, including in the form of democraticdecision-making, will lead to the re-emergence of inequality and the increasinginfluence of commodityrelationsand ultimately willead back to capitalism*147Based onsuchjudgments,Lotta thinkshighlyofMao'svalorizationof theRevolutionary Committees, within which important features of the commune modelwere incorporated, including elections in the mass organizations and cadreparticipation in labor. He comments,

The CR and the creation of new revolutionary organs, like therevolutionary committees, involved masses of people and theirrepresentativesonadramaticallyenlargedscaleateverylevel.Itinvolved unprecedented means for ensuring that the participation of themasses was genuine and profound; through extremely widespreaddebate and discussion, through continuing political-ideologicalstruggle, and through direct leadership responsibility. (By 1973, anestimated forty thousand workers in Shanghai held leading positions infactories, other work units, and higher level municipal organs.)148

But why were the revolutionary committees themselves ultimately unable towithstand the onslaught of thecapitalistroaderswhosuccessfullywaged a coupd'etatimmediately after Mao's death? Lotta believes that this reveals an important lesson ofthe CR and of the experience of the Shanghai Commune. He avers that no politicalstructure or form is intrinsically impervious to bourgeois degeneration. The communeform, revolutionary committee, and communist vanguard parties can all be147Ibid.148Ibid.

111transformedintooppressivevehiclesofbourgeoisproduction andsocialrelations.Butcompared to the revolutionary committees, the Commune form, in a society stillmarked by significant and profound class and social divisions and the correspondingideological influences, could not well“serve the task of enabling power to be kept inthe hands of the masses and enabling the masses to carry forward the process oftransforming the economic base of society and all the social and political relations andinstitutions, and the culture and ways of thinking among the people—and advancingthe world revolution."149 In the end, Lotta asserts that “fidelity”' to the ShanghaiCommune, as Badiou has insisted on, could not prevent capitalist restoration in Chinaand is not a path for an emancipatory politics.150

RecentChineseReappraisalsoftheShanghaiCommune

There is a powerful trend of positively re-evaluating the CR coming fromgrass-roots people and non-mainstream intellectuals. This is going up in the face ofthe mainstream narrative, which simply “thoroughly negates the CR"and labels theShanghai Commune and its supporters as counterrevolutionary. But this narrative isbecoming unconvincing, unfounded, and to some degree irrelevant, because it is thecurrent regimewhichhasgonethrough aprocessof“de-revolutionization"that aredisseminating the idea of opposing almost all revolutions in the mass media. Under149 Ibid., emphasis original.150AlainBadiou'sPoliticsofEmancipation:ACommunismLockedWithintheConfinesof theBourgeoisWorldbyRaymond Lotta,NayiDuniya,and K.J.A.,fromhttp://www.demarcations-journal.org/issue01/demarcations_badiou.html,citedonOctober8,2009.

112such circumstances, some of the efforts to negate of the Shanghai Commune havetaken a different twist of concealing and defacing the real character of the ShanghaiCommune. He Shu's research of the Shanghai Commune is a case in point. IronicallyHe Shu, an intellectual in the establishment (tizhi nei zhishifenzi) and a mouthpiece ofthe Chongqing government on the Party history, makes the accusation that distortionsby political leaders about the true nature of theShanghai Commune can befound inofficial historical materials.151 In his article “The So-called ‘Shanghai JanuaryRevolution'During theCR—A Manufactured*CR Model by MaoZedong"",he aversthat the so-called “January Revolution" in Shanghai was actually unworthy of thename, and almost says that it never existed, that the Shanghai rebels never reallyseized the power of the SPC; and that the"achievements"of the"Shanghai Storm ofJanuary Power Seizure”is sheer fiction.According to He Shu, Mao manufactured thelaurel of the ^January Revolution" to bestow on his disciples. And he did this in orderto cultivate his sworn followers in Shanghai, such as Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuanand Jiang Qing, who spared no effort to propagate the CR line. In addition, He Shubelieves that the“baseless"achievements which Mao"talked through his neck'wasconversely attributed toMao's"wisdom and greatness"byhis"sycophanticcourtiers",152

Cao Weiping, a former Red Guard at the Fudan University in Shanghai and acurrent internet activist who has done much research on the Shanghai Commune.151He Shuworks as deputy chf editrfonganChqiuChroncle ofedClif)whichwasrubyPartyStudies Office of Chongqing Party Committee, and he was also a long-term collaborator of above-mentioned WangNianyionthestudyofCR.12HeShu,Wengehong suoweideShanghaiyiyue geming”MaoZedong zhizaodeyige“wengeyangban”("The So-called‘Shanghai January Revolution'During the CR—A Manufactured‘CR Model by Mao Zedong’"),in Dangdaizhongguoyanjiu (Contemporary China Studies),No.2,2001.

113repudiated He Shu's conclusions as "nonsense".As a former Shanghai Red Guardwho participated in the bombardment of Zhang Chunqiao, Cao Weiping has anegativeevaluation of Zhang.ButCaovalorizes Zhang'sview that themass rally of“bringing down Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu" on January 5 1967 was an indication ofthe rebels’ seizure of power from the old SPC, that the actual seizure of power tookplace even earlier, and that the only differencelay in thefact that the power seizureoefore the rally was just local and partial. Cao argues that the loyalists' walking-offfrom their working positions, and the blowing of the wind of economism, which weremasterminded by the old power holders in Shanghai at the end of 1966, signaled theSPC's automatic renunciation of power. This is because, as Cao argues, “theoreaching of duty of the rulers means the loss of power. In this sense, there had beenalways automatic renunciations of power by the rulers themselves rather than powerseizures by the rebels."CaoWeiping declares that He Shu's denial of the initiation ofpower seizures bytheShanghai rebels with thepretext of thelatefounding of theShanghai Commune is unfounded. After the rally on January 5 1967, the Shanghairebels clearly took over power from the old Shanghai authorities and formed theFrontlineHeadquarters,the Committee of Defending the GreatProletarianRevolutionand the Liaison Post of the Rebel Organizations, in place of the original ShanghaiMunicipal Committee, Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the SPC. Cao concludesthat because He Shu and others who thought like him realized this was “their stigma(emphasis mine), they tended to disallow the fact of power seizure even many yearslater. He Shu pointed to the fact that the two most important rebel documents in

114January—MessagetoAllShanghaiPeopleon5January1967andtheUrgentNoticeon January 9, 1967—did not even mention the words “power seizure” to negate therebels'powerseizure.But CaoWeipng argues that this does not disprove the actualpower seizure. As for He Shu's claim that it was Mao who single-handedly“"manufactured" the “January Revolution" out of the thin air, Cao holds that it was theShanghai rebels who launched and “invented" the January Revolution and that Maojust theoretically summarized the experiences of the January Storm.133 In the fourthchapter of my dissertation, somewhat differing from Cao Weiping's arguments, Iargue that around the January Revolution, a political dual power status appeared inShanghai. The first pole of the dual power was the old SPC, which was significantlydisgraced by the discontented rebels due to its tyrannical behavior toward the massmovement and it was said to be “completely collapsed" at the time of the colossalrally of January 6, 1967. But the SPC still nominally and partially held the Shanghailocal state apparatus in its hands. The other pole of the dual power was a “controllinggovernment in the form of organizations created by rebels. Later power strugglesbetween the two poles, I argue, eventually drove the old SPC out of the dual powerstructure.

As CR memoirs without the permission from the authorities were forbidden tobe published in mainland China after the coup d'état, many celebrities of the CRchose to publicize their recollections in Hong Kong or Taiwan. Understandably, manyof these writings are much more anti-Mao, anti-CR and anti-communist than even the153 Cao Weiping, Ping He Shu wenge zhong suowei de “Shanghai yiyue geming" yiwen Commends on He Shu'TheSo-called‘ShanghaiJanuaryRevolution'DuringtheCR—AManufactured‘CRModelbyMaoZedong),seehttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=12396citedonDec.5,2009.

115Chinese authorities, at least on the surface, because most of the presses in Hong Kongand Taiwan are controlled by pro-capitalist owners. These anti-CR memoirs by oldParty or army officials and “scar literature" by the privileged intellectuals all repeatedeach other and distorted historical reality so much. And for this reason, many Chinesereaders lost interest in these works. In recent years, presses in Hong Kong and Taiwanhave chosen to publish many anti-CR memoirs by former rebel leaders. Therepresentative authors of these works include some former members of the CCRG inthe top leadership, such as Wang Li and Chen Boda, and some local rebel leaders,such as Nie Yuanzi in Beijing, Lu Li'an in Wuhan, Yang Xiaokai, Chen Yi'nan inChangsha, and Xu Jingxian and Chen Jide in Shanghai. Understandably, the negationof the CR by these former “Maoist" rebel leaders are perhaps more convincing andeffective in their demonization of the CR than that of the old privileged class such asold Party officials or intellectuals. Lu Li'an, for example, a former ultra-leftist“Maoist"’ who claimed to carry through the CR to the end and “overthrow everything",now talks on the Free Asian Radio run by the American government - saying thatMao was no more than a Hitler. Yang Xiaokai, another former ultra-leftist “Maoist" inChangsha had insisted on instituting a Chinese People's Commune in the wake ofRevolutionary Committee movement during the CR. Then, after the coup det'at in1976, Yang totally abandoned his beliefs in communism and converted himself into aChristian and a neo-liberal economist. It has been said that he had the potential to winthe Nobel Prize for economics, but unfortunately, Yang died in Australia in hismid-fifties. These views about the CR in the Reform Era have deeply influenced

116many young people to oppose communism and Mao's legacy.

Xu Jingxian was the de facto No. 1 rebel leader in Shanghai during the lateyears of the CR since his seniors in Shanghai—Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan andWang mainly worked in the Party's Center in Beijing. Xu's memoir, Ten Years ADream, published in Hong Kong in 2005, focuses on the Shanghai CR and providesuseful material on the January Storm and the Shanghai Commune. Before the CR, XuJingxian worked in the Writers' Group of the SPC. With the encouragement of ZhangChunqiao and YaoWenyuan, he led the Writers' Group to rebel collectively. After theJanuary Storm, he was elected into the leadership of the new Shanghai power organ.After the coup d'etat in 1976, he was jailed for 20 years. With this background, XuJingxian carries some weight in terms of his arguments that discredit the CR. Ifreaders of“TenYears A Dream”subscribe toXu's views in this book,they will notonly end up looking down on the worker leaders and manual laborers, but alsoappraise theCR as aludicrousfarce.

Cao Weiping wrote a long article commenting on Xu Jingxian's memoir.154Cao disclosed that Xu Jingxian was a loyalist (laobao) who helped to suppress therebels in the early stages of the CR. Compelled by the pressing circumstances, Xubecame an opportunist in disguise, who felt he had to join the rebel ranks. But evenafter he converted himself into a “rebel", his non-revolutionary political line affectedwhat he did. For example, when he wielded power, Xu Jingxian as a loyalist did agreat deal to suppress genuine rebels. Cao says that Xu's book is in effect a smear154 CaoWeiping,Ping Xu laosan shinian yimeng(Comments onXu laosan's “TenYearsA Dream"), eehttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=2614 cited onDec.5,2009.

117campaign of the true rebels and the mass movement, and an attack on the CR - andthat this really shows Xu Jingxian's loyalist political nature and his desire to return tohis original rank as a pro-establishment laobao.What angered Cao Weiping most wasXu Jingxian's claim that thefundamentalreasonfor theJanuaryRevolutionwas therebels' personal ambition to wield power in the biggest city of China. Xu Jingxian'sbook tries to justify the capitalist roaders'vilification of the rebels and the JanuaryRevolution in another way. Cao Weiping reveals and criticizes how Xu Jingxian doeshis best in his memoir to describe and exaggerate the contradictions among variousrebel organizations. Cao says this shows that Xu does not have one iota of classsentiment Gjieji ganqing) toward the proletariat. Cao refutes Xu Jingxian's blame fonthe wind of economism on the rebels by correctly pointing out that it is the loyalistand the economist workers,who were encouraged by the old Shanghai power holders.not the rebels,who should be held responsiblefor the spate of economism.Cao arguesthat what actually happened in the January Revolution is that the old SPC, led byChen Pixian and Cao Diqiu, tried to exert pressure on the Maoist leadership in theParty Center with economic measures.When the rebels and Red Guards stood outagainst the wind of economism and tooktheresponsibilityfor production,powershifted from the old SPC into the hands of the rebels. With regard to Xu Jingxian'scondemnation of the economist organizations in his memoir, CaoWeiping's view isthat the rebels should not have labeled all the economic demands of the temporaryworkers and sub-contract workers’organizations as “economist" because most of theireconomicdemandswereinfactreasonable.On the onehand,unreasonableeconomic

118phenomena should beimproved,-for examplein1971 Maoordered that alltemporary and sub-contract workers should be granted the position of full-timeworkers.Ontheotherhand,therebelsshouldhavesteeredthenarroweconomistinclinations of the temporary and sub-contract workers’ organizations in arevolutionary,political direction.And even if some of the workerswere unwilling tobe re-oriented in a political direction, they still should not have been classified asundesirable,unbelievable and/ornon-revolutionary.

In concluding his comments on Xu Jingxian's book, Cao Weiping proposesthat in order to avoid the new revolutionary power organ being usurped by XuJingxian-like old bureaucrats, it is necessary to institute an election which includes allmass organizations yet excludes class enemies (who comprised 5 percent of thepeople, at most). This will avoid armed struggles among various mass organizationsin the process of power distribution. Cao further suggests a specific way of carryingout elections:eachvoter can onlyvote for one candidate and this candidate can beanyone. If one is satisfied with someone,one can give one's vote to this person face toface. The more votes a person gets the more power he/she can wield, if he/she passesthestipulatednumbersofvotesforenteringinto thenewpower organ.Forexampleat the time of the formation of the Shanghai Commune, if it had been stipulated thatanyone who got 2,000 or 3,000 votes could enter into the new power organ, thenevery 2,000 or 3,000 voters in Shanghai could have had their one representative, whowas subject to recall any time by his/her voters in accordance with the principles ofthe Paris Commune. While admitting that it is not the system that determines the

119nature of a society, Cao thinks that some kinds of systems should be instituted alongwiththedevelopment of a society.Nevertheless,hewarns that one should neverenshrine a system - thinking that a system in and of itself is going to solve theproblem. The most democratic thing in the world, he claims, is revolution. Thethinking that a newsystem can resolve all the problems is merely a beautifulillusion.155155 ibid.

of theProletariat

During the CR, a Mao quotation was repeatedly invoked by different politicalforces, “The force at the core leading our cause forward is the Chinese CommunistParty; the theoretical basis guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism."f In the earlystages of the CR, Mao hailed the first big-character poster by a group of teachers andstaff members at the Beijing University as “the first Marxist-Leninist" big-characterposter. On the eve and at the height of the CR, the Maoists called for establishing “awholly new form of state structure” patterned after the Paris Commune which hadbeen interpreted as an ideal (semi-) state model in the Marxist tradition.2 In 1975, inthe last days of his life, Mao urgently pointed out that in the Chinese CommunistParty there were not many people who really understood Marxism-Leninism, and hecalled on people, especially highParty and Army cadres to study original works ofMarx, Engels and Lenin.? As we can see, for Mao and his followers, the launchingand operation of the CR was theoretically based on Marxism-Leninism especially the1Quotations from Chairman Mao Tsetung, Peking Foreign Languages Press, 1966, p.1.

After sweeping away the monarchical order and establishment of the capitalistrelations of production, class struggle between producing class and appropriatingclasses became progressively intensified. Marx observed that the state power inFrance “more and more developed its character as the instrument of class despotism.the political engine for forcibly perpetuating the social enslavement of the producersof wealth by its appropriators, of the economic rule of capital over labor."? Eachrevolution inmodernFrance could only strengthen therepressive character of thestate power, since the bourgeoisie, in order to maintain their privileges, employed theviolent aspects of the state machinery more and more mercilessly.

TheFrenchworkingmasseswere committed to tobreaking their enslavementDisregarding Marx's warning that any working masses’uprising would untimely be"desperate folly" as the reactionary forces were stronger and there was danger of arestoration of the monarchy. Inface of thebetrayal of the French bourgeoisie duringthePrussian-FrancoWar,theParisianworkersmadeuptheirminds totake armsagainst the appropriating class and duly set up the Paris Commune in March 1871.Even though Marx believed that the working class had not yet acquired the ability torule the nation,he still enthusiastically hailed the historical initiative of thestorming-heavenmasses.

As the sphinx of the Paris Commune was tantalizing to the bourgeois mind11 Ibid. p.70.12 Ibid. p.8

124Marx disclosed that its true secret layin the fact that it was“essentially aworking-class government, the product of the struggle of the producing against theappropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out theeconomical emancipation of labor."13The working-class nature of the ParisCommune was not only true in the sense that the bulk of the National Guard, whichreplaced the old standing army serving the interests of the bourgeoisie, consisted ofworking men and women, but also that “The Commune was formed of the municipalcouncilors, chosen by universal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsibleand revocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturally workingmen, or acknowledged representatives of the working class."14 According to Marx,many of the social, economic and political measures the Paris Commune adoptedserved to deracinate “the economical foundations upon which rests the existence ofclasses, and therefore of class-rule. With labor emancipated, every man becomes aworking man, and productive labor ceases to be a class attribute.*15 The workingmen's government of the Paris Commune, as the at-last-discovered political form tohave labor economically emancipated, Marx stressed, was emphatically internationalWithin sight of the Prussian army, that had annexed to Germany two Frenchprovinces, the Commune annexed to France the working people all over the world."Aworking-class power did not necessarily presuppose that the working peopleaccounted for the majority of the population as long as the workers held hegemonyand led the revolution forward to the economic and political emancipation of the13 Ibid. p.75.14 Marx, Karl. The Civil War in France, in MECW, Vol.22, p.331.15 Ibid.,p.335.

125masses. By labeling the Paris Commune as the workers'rule, Marx argued that theParisian working class was openly acknowledged as the only class capable of socialinitiative by the Parisians, even by the great bulk of the Parisian middleclass--shopkeepers, tradesmen, merchants—but not the wealthy capitalists. Bypromising and practicing an economical government, the Commune saved the urbanmiddle class from debts, and could have saved the peasantry from the blood tax, fromall kinds of judicial vampires, from the tyranny of the garde champetre, the gendarme.and the prefect, and from the stultification by the priests. Established as the workingmen's government, as the bold champion of the emancipation of labor, Marx averred,the Commune was at the same time the true representative of all the healthy elementsof the French society, and hence a truly national government.

Even though Marx himself did not literally call the Paris Commune the“dictatorship of the Proletariat", his close friend Engels referred to the Commune as amanifestation of the dictatorship of the Proletariat.At the end of his“Introduction tothe Civil War in France", Engels posited, “Of late, the Social-Democratic philistinehas once more been filled with wholesome terror at the words: dictatorship of theproletariat. Well and good, gentlemen, do you want to know what this dictatorshiplookslike?Look attheParisCommune.Thatwas theDictatorshipof theproletariat.16 Critical of Engels’ assessment of the Paris Commune, many scholarsand politicians such as Erik Molnar, disagree with Engels arguing that the Communeshould be considered merely a petti-bourgeois and radical democratic regime, or just a16 Ibid.p.34.

126workers’rule,but not the dictatorship of the proletariat In order to understand thenature of the Paris Commune as defined by Marx, it is necessary to go back to Marx'sownexplanations about the dictatorshipof theProletariat.

In the Manifesto of theCommunistParty publishedin1848,Marx and Engelsexpounded that the first step of the working class revolution was “to raise theproletariat to the position of the ruling class, to win the battle of democracy.*"17 In1850, when criticizing the doctrinaire socialism of the petti-bourgeoisie, Marx statedthat socialism is was“the declaration of the permanence of the revolution, the classdictatorship of the proletariat as the necessary transit point to the abolition of classdistinctions generally, to the abolition of all the relations of production on which theyrest, to the abolition of all the social relations that correspond to these relations ofproduction, to the revolutionizing of all the ideas that result from these socialrelations."l81In 1852, Marx introduced the concept of the dictatorship of theproletariat moreclearly.He said

Nowasformyself,I donotclaimtohavediscoveredeithertheexistence of classes in modern society or the struggle between themLong before me,bourgeois historians had described the historicaldevelopment of this struggle between the classes, as had bourgeoiseconomists their economic anatomy. My own contribution was 1. toshowthattheexistenceofclassesismerelyboundupwithcertainhistorical phases in the development of production; 2. that the classstruggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat; 3. thatthis dictatorship itself constitutes no more than a transition to the

abolition of all classes and to a classless society.1917 K. Marx and F. Engels. Manifesto of the Communist Party,in MECw. Volume 6, p.504.18Kar Marx,TheClassStruggles inFrance1848 to1850,inMECW.Volume10,p127.19 Marx to Joseph Weydemeyer. 5 March, 1852, in MECW. Volume 39, pp.62-65.

127

The phrase above only appeared in one of his personal letters to his friendJoseph Weydemeyer, and Marx did not further elaborate on the concept of thedictatorship of theproletariat.But if we read this letter together with the Manifesto in1848, the basic meaning here is clear. That is, in modern society, after the decisivecollapse of the monarchical system, the class struggle, between the bourgeoisie andthe proletariat became increasingly intensified. It was in the course of such historicaldevelopments that the proletariat, by the force of circumstances, could raise its ownclass consciousness and “organize itself as a class"; and through a revolutionestablish itself as the ruling class. In other words, the dictatorship of the proletariat.according to Marx at this stage, referred to the working class's elevation of itself tothe ruling class, and the revolutionization of the old power organ into a workerspower.In Marx's view, there was not much difference between the dictatorship of theproletariat and the working peoples'government, solong as the latter took upon itselfthe goal of the abolition of class distinctions.Under a workers' government, theproletariat would"sweep away byforce the old conditions of production; then it willalong with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the existence of classantagonisms and of classesgenerally,andwilltherebyhave abolished its ownsupremacy as a class."When class distinctions disappear, “the public power will loseits political character." 20

Even though Marx did not explicitly label the Paris Commune as “thedictatorship of the proletariat" in his first, second, and final draft of his famous piece20 K. Marx and F. Engels. Manifesto of the Communist Party, in MECW. Volume 6, pp.505-506.

128TheCivil War in France,he used the term“working-classgovernment"to refer to thenature of the Paris Commune regime. For Marx, the Paris Commune was an historicalmoment in which the working class transformed itself tobecome theruling class, amoment of intense class struggle leading to the dictatorship of the proletariat.Therefore, it would be hard to say that Marx would object to referring to the ParisCommune as “the dictatorship of the proletariat". On September 25, 1871, severalmonths after the defeat of the Paris Commune, Marx coined the term of"proletariandictature” at a meeting celebrating the seventh anniversary of the International, whichmany Communard refugees attended. Marx said,

The last movement was the Commune, the greatest that had yet beenmade, and there could not be two opinions about it — the Communewas theconquestof thepoliticalpower of theworkingclasses.Therewas much misunderstanding about the Commune.The Communecould not found a new form of class government. In destroying theexisting conditions of oppression by transferring all the means of laborto the productive laborer, and thereby compelling every able-bodiedindividual to work for a living, the only base for class rule andoppression would be removed. But before such a change could beeffected a proletarian dictature would become necessary, and thefirstcondition of that was a proletarian army. The working classes wouldhave to conquer the right to emancipate themselves on the battlefield.The task of the International was to organize and combine the forces oflabor for the coming struggle.21

Somepeoplecould use thesewords to argue that even thoughMarxpositedthe Paris Commune as “the political power of the working classes", the Communewas far from“the dictatorship of the proletariat", since it did not “found a new formof class government”and under the framework of the Commune, “a proletarian21Record of Marx's Speech on the Seventh Anniversary of the International,in MECW. Volume 22 p.634.

129dictature would become necessary."But with a deepeer look,we will find that Marxhere, rather than denying the Paris Commune's nature as“the dictatorship of theproletariat",stressed thenecessityofintroducingmorespecificandforcefulmeasurestomaketheParisCommunemoreviableandsustainable,asaworkers'governmentThe great social measure of the Commune, according to Marx, was “its own workingexistence” and“its special measures could but betoken the tendency of a governmentof the people by the people."" In refuting the “apologetic phraseology of themouthpieces of present society with its two poles of Capital and Wage-slavery", Marxstated that“the Commune intended to abolish that class-property which makes thelabor of themanythewealthof thefew.It aimed at theexpropriation of theexpropriators. It wanted to make individual property a truth by transforming themeans of production, land and capital, now chiefly the means of enslaving andexploiting labor, into mere instruments of free and associated labor. “But this isCommunism...23Apart from its socialist tendency, Marx was very clear that therewas"nothing socialist”in the decisions made by the Paris Commune,24whichcouldbe seen as a shortcoming and reason for the defeat of the Commune.To establish aviablenewform of classgovernment,theCommunardsshouldhavedestroyedwithforce the existing conditions of oppressionby transferring all the means of labor to thelabor of production. In order to achieve this, a powerful proletarian army that couldexecute proletarian dictatorship would have been necessary. More than once in hissummaries of the lessons of the Paris Commune, Marx deplored the military22 Marx, Karl. The Civil War in France, in MECW. Volume 22. p.339.23Marx,Karl.The Civil War inFrance,inMECW.Volume 22. p.335.24 Marx, Karl. The Civil War in France,in MECW. Volume 22. p.499.

130weakness and inefficiency of the Commune to ward off its enemies.For instance, theCommunardsshould have advanced toVersaillesimmediately after theuprising; theCentralMilitaryCommitteeshouldnothavetransferreditspower totheCommunesoearly; universal suffrage should not have been put into effect so hastily, and so forth.In short, the Commune should have used more violent suppression, that is, exercisedproletarian dictatorship,rather than democracy toward its enemies in and outside ofParis. The first task of the working class was to seize power in order to found “a newform of class government”" on the basis of revolutionary violence, to compel everyable-bodied individual to work for a living so as to remove the only base for class ruleand oppression, and to ward off possible bourgeois military forces or other kind ofinterventions. Only with this could the workers'power be consolidated in the name of‘'thedictatorshipoftheproletariat"

In1875,MarxwroteCritiqueof theGothaProgramme,inwhichheterselydefined “the dictatorship of the proletariat” as the following.

Between capitalist and communist societylies theperiod of therevolutionary transformation of the one into the other. Correspondingto this is also a political transition period in which the state can benothing but the revolutionary dictatorshipof theproletariat.

Marx said that the Paris Commune was a working men's government: “Thered flag, hoisted by the Paris Commune, crowns in reality only the government ofworkmen for Paris!25 And did the Paris Commune inherently oppose capitalism andhave a tendency to initiate a transformation of capitalism toward socialism and25Ibid. p.499.

131communism? Marx's answer would be yes. To strengthen his argument, Marx quoteda Journalofficiel of theCentralCommitteeoftheNationalGuard,

The workmen, who produce everything and enjoy nothing, who sufferfrom misery in the midst of their accumulated products, the fruit oftheir work and their sweat, ... shall they never be allowed to work fortheir emancipation?.. The proletariat, in face of the permanent menaceagainst its rights, of the absolute negation of all its legitimateaspirations, of the ruin of the country and all its hopes,has understoodthat it was its imperious duty and its absolute right to take into itshands its own destinies and to assure their triumph in seizing the statepower (en s'emparant du pouvoir).26

Marx held,it was plainly stated here that the government by the working classcould save France and carry the national business by working for its ownemancipation; and the workers’ struggle was proclaimed as a war of labor upon themonopolists of the means of labor, upon capital.?7 For Marx, the Paris Commune hadwaged a war against capitalism since the working class of the Paris “clearly,consciously proclaimed the Emancipation of Labor, and the transformation of Society.as their goal?"28 The goal of the social movement advocated by previous utopiansocialist founders of different groups, that is, superceeding the wage system with allits economical conditions of class rule, was also the Paris Commune's goal. But themeansidentifiedtoachievethisweredifferentandtherealconditionsofthemovement were no longer clouded in utopian fables since“in their place came a realinsight into the historic conditions of the movement and a more and more gathering26 Ibid. p.500.27 Ibid. p.500-501.28 Ibid.p.499.

132force of the military organization of the working class."29 The Paris Commune, as aworkers’ power, aimed at the expropriation of the expropriators. This was an endeavorto transform every man into a productive laborer, not an exploiter. That is, as labor isemancipated from capital, every man will become a worker. The Paris Commune,oriented toward communism, was no more than “the produce of the struggle of theproducing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered underwhich to work out the economical emancipation of labor."530Asforthetransformationof society, the Paris Commune had a vivid anti-capitalist nature as well, since theworkers understood that “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-madeState machinery, and wield it for its own purposes."The old bourgeois statemachinery was thoroughly smashed and a new type state—the “the dictatorship of theproletariat'wasthusestablishedintheParisCommune.

Nevertheless, Marx explained, “the actual ‘social' character of their Republicconsists only in this, that workmen govern the Paris Commune! As to their measures,they must, by the nature of things, be principally confined to the military defence ofParis and its approvisionment."31 That is to say, the main reason to refer to the ParisCommune as“the dictatorship of the proletariat”was the Commune's politicalbreak-away from the old bourgeois power organ, not its economic measures. TheCommune, consisting mostly of working men, or acknowledged representatives of theworking class, was a working, not a bourgeois parliamentary body, executive andlegislative at the same time.All the Commune's functionaries were paid at workmen's29Ibid. p.500.30Ibid.p.334.31Ibid.p.499.

133wages. The bourgeois standing army was replaced by the armed masses. The policeforce was stripped of its bourgeois political attributes, and turned into responsible andat all times revocable agent of the Commune. The judicial functionaries were divestedof their sham independence whichhad served theinterests of the ruling class. Bydecreeingtheseparationofthechurchfromthestate,theCommunebrokethespiritual force of repression, the“parson-power.”All these political measures of theCommune anticipated the later socialist and communist movement all over the worldPolitics had been put in command. And Marx fully believed that had the Communesurvived, it would have unavoidably taken more advanced actions to emancipate laborfrom capital as “The political rule of the producer cannot coexist with theperpetuation of his social slavery. The Commune was therefore to serve as a lever foruprooting the economical foundations upon which rests the existence of classes, andtherefore of class rule. With labor emancipated, every man becomes a working manand productive labor ceases to be a class atribute *32

Unfortunately, the Commune did not last long and there was not enough timeto shake off the “survivors of and devotees to past revolutions", the unavoidable evilwhich hampered the real action of the working class,*? or implement more social andeconomic measures to transform the capitalist relations of production and advance thesocialist cause. As the pillar of “the dictatorship of the proletariat", the communardarmy was not strong enough to suppress the counteroffensive of the bourgeoisstanding troops. Moreover, the Commune was too merciful to the enemies. The32Ibid.pp.334-335.33Ibid.p.341.

134Communelacked strongleadership.And all thesepolitical and militaryweaknessesmade it impossible for the Commune to deepen the revolutionary transformations insociety. In discussing “the dictatorship of the proletariat", Rosa Luxemburg held that“"This dictatorship consists in the manner of applying democracy, not in its elimination,but in energetic, resolute attacks upon the well-entrenched rights and economicrelationships of bourgeois society,without which a socialist transformation cannot beaccomplished."34 It is true that the Commune, by effecting “the dictatorship of theproletariat,” applied unprecedented democracy to the broadest masses. However, oneof the problems of the Commune, according to Engels, was that it applied too muchdemocracy to its enemies.And it should have used authority over its enemies morefreely. If it had not made use of the authority of the armed people against thebourgeoisie, Engels averred, the Paris Commune would have not lasted a single day.35Yet this is by no means to say that Marx or Engels, as the masters of dialecticsdownplayed the role of democracy with “the dictatorship of the proletariat."For them,there never exists either a dictatorship without democracy, or a democracy withoutdictatorship; it is a unity of opposites. When people talk about "pure democracywithout dictatorship, society will be transformed into an a-political society- and theoriginal meaning of “democracy” will disappear, that is, democracy as a politicalconceptualization will lose its political attributes. In addition, as Rosa Luxemburgposited, the “dictatorship of the proletariat” should also consist in the form of"energetic, resolute attacks upon the well-entrenched rights and economic34 Rosa Luxemburg, The Russian Revolution, in Rosa Luxemburg, Selected Poliical Writings. Cape, 1972, p.249.35 F. Engels. On Authority, in MECW. Volume 23. p.425.

135relationships of bourgeois society."But the Commune virtually did not have any timeto initiate these tasks. Not only was the issue of abolishing private property not putbefore the Commune, but also the well-trenched bourgeois rights were not dealt with.On the contrary,“by a sagacious settlement of that ever-recurring cause of disputeamong the middle classes themselves — the debtor and creditor accounts,”theCommune saved the Paris middle class—shopkeepers, tradesmen, merchants;3° byfreeing the dying civil society from the boa constrictor-like, parasitical excrescence ofthe state, the Commune in effect saved the “living civil society". A major portion ofParis' middle class of the bourgeoisie took the side of the Commune during its earlydays. In this sense, the Paris Commune was none other than an embryonic model ofthe dictatorship of theproletariat

Leninhad nodoubt of thenatureof theParis Commune:“TheCommunewasa dictatorship of the proletariat."37Yet he pointed out that the real task of theCommune was above all to put into effect a minimum programme, that is, ademocratic, not a socialist dictatorship.38 For him, a dictatorship of the proletariatmeant workers'power, not necessary asocialist dictatorship,yettheformer had toadvance toward the latter, sooner or later. After all, a fully developed “dictatorship oftheproletariat"of communistrevolution,asMarx andEngelshypothesizedintheManifesto, required two“radical ruptures": the most radical rupture with traditionalproperty relations and the most radical rupture with traditional ideas in the36 Marx, Karl.

136development of the communist revolution.39 The Commune did very little in terms ofbrining about these two“radical ruptures." For the emancipation of the workingpeople on an international scale, the Paris Commune was only an initial beginningor quoting Stalin, “neither a complete nor a firm" type of the dictatorship of theproletariat. It was the first yet significant step toward the long march of socialism andcommunism. As Stalin put it, “The bourgeois revolution is usually consummated withthe seizure of power,whereas in the proletarian revolution the seizure of power isonly the beginning." 40

TheCommunalSemi-State

Bearing the lessons of the newly-defeated Paris Commune in mind, Marx andEngels stated in the preface to the new German edition of The Manifesto of theCommunist Party that that “this programme has in some details become antiquated."Specifically, to repeat Marx's stress in The Civil War in France, the Commune provedthat “the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made State machinery,and wield it for its own purposes".4l Rather, the working class should overcome,break down, or shatter [Sprengung]*" the old state machinery itself. Marx claimedthat the Commune was the direct opposite of the Empire, the ultimate and exhaustingshape of the governmental power of old society.439 Marx & Engels, Manifesto of the Communist Party,in MECW.

137

Whatcharacterized theStatemachinery of theSecond Empire and the ensuingbourgeois Republic Versailles regime, which the Paris Commune smashed?Accordingto Marx, the modern bourgeois state, the Second Empire and the ensuing Versaillesregime included, was embodied in two great organs, parliament and government, onwhich the Commune set the target of struggle. Since the Second Empire had alreadydisbanded the parliament and concentrated the State power in the government, “all theworking class had to do was not to revive it [parliamentarism]."4+As for the parasiticgovernment, the repressive organs of the bourgeoisie - the bureaucracy, police,standing army, clergy and magistrature, among others, had to be smashed. What theCommune did to smash the old state machinery were,

The first decree of the Commune,therefore,was the suppression of thestanding army, and the substitution for it of the armed people....TheCommune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen byuniversal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible andrevocable at short terms. The majority of its members were naturallyworking men, of acknowledged representatives of the working class.The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary, body,executive and legislative at the same time.Instead of continuing to bethe agent of the Central Government, the police was at once stripped ofits political attributes, and turned into the responsible and at all timesrevocable agent of the Commune. So were the officials of all otherbranches of the Administration.From the members of the Communedownwards, the public service had to be done at workmen's wages.The vested interests and the representation allowances of the highdignitaries of State disappeared along with the high dignitariesthemselves....Having once got rid of the standing army and the police,the physicalforce elements of the old Government,the Commune wasanxious tobreak the spiritual force of repression, the"parson-power,”..The whole of the educational institutions wereopened to the people gratuitously, and at the same time cleared of all

interference of Church andState.Thus,not onlywas education made44Ibid.p.536.

Like the rest of public servants, magistrates and judgeswere to be elective, responsible, and revocable.45

For Marx, the state of the Second Empire was separated from and independentfrom society. But the forecited measures adopted by the communards enabled there-absorption of the state power by the society, “as its own living forces instead of asforces controlling and subduing it, by the popular masses themselves, forming theirown force instead of the organized force of their suppression — the political form oftheir social emancipation, instead of the artificial force (appropriated by theinoppressors) (their own force opposed to and organized against them) of societywielded for their oppression by their enemies."46 As mentioned above, Marx believedthat the Commune not only freed Paris’ middle class, but also saved the “living civilsociety” from the parasitc, repressive state of the Second Empire. The Communerepresented a living society, which was diametrically opposed to the old State.Obviously, Marx harbored an animosity toward the state as a form of class rule.Veryoften, Marx spoke of the existing modern state in a politically derogative tone as a‘parasitic excrescence” and "boa constrictor" to society and the nation. Similarly,Engels described, “the state is nothing but a machine for the oppression of one classby another, and indeed in the democratic republic no less than in the monarchy; and atbest an evil...'"4745 Karl Marx.

139

Then canwesay thatMarxwasinfavor of abolishing thewhole and all statesonce and for all without any conditions? It seems that Marx did claim that theCommune was against the state itself.In the first draft of TheCivil War in France,Marx wrote that the communard uprising was not a revolution“against this or that.legitimate, constitutional, republican or Imperialist form of State Power. It was aRevolution against the State itself, this supernaturalist abortion of society, aresumption by the people for the people, of its own social life.48 The proletariat'snew social task was to“break the instrument of that class rule—the State,thecentralized and organized governmental power usurping tobe the master instead ofthe servant of society.'4"But in the second draft of The Civil War in France and thefinal version of The Civil War in France, Marx retained similar phrasing to say thatthe Commune was the true antithesis to the Empire, but he abandoned the descriptionthat the Commune was against the state itself. This change is significant. One of theconcerns of Marx here, I hypothesize, was that he had distanced himself from theposition of the anarchists,whofrom thebeginning of theproletariat revolutionfrequently proposed the abolition of the state.

InthefinalversionofTheCivilWarinFrance,Marxrephrasedthispart as“"The direct antithesis to the Empire was the Commune. The cry of *Social Republic,with which the revolution of February was ushered in by the Paris proletariat, did butexpress a vague aspiration after a Republic that was not only to supersede themonarchical form of class-rule, but class-rule itself. The Commune was the positive48 Karl Marx, First Draft of the Civil War in France, in MECW. Volume 22. p.486.49 Ibid.pp.486-487.

140form of that Republic."5O That is to say, what the Paris working class opposed was'class rule", more specificly, the class-rule of the expropriators, not the class-rule ofthe producers, not the proletariat state, that is, the dictatorship of the proletariat.Andthis kind of new proletarian state, e.g. the Communal state, since it abolished themajor oppressive organs of the old bourgeois state, most notably the bureaucracy andthe standing army, Engels claimed, ceased to be a state in the true sense of the term;§1and it began to“wither away”from the first day of its establishment. But theCommunal state and the workers’“Social Republic", without doubt, were also certaintypes of the state. It was Marx who viewed the Paris Commune organization as aSocial Republic'. And a democratic republic, Engels held, was even “the specificform for the dictatorship of the proletariat."² However, Lenin believed that theproletarian state that withers away was only “commune state*53and semi-state.54

From Marx's perspective, the Paris Commune did not mean a completedestruction of the old State. Rather, "In its most simple conception the Communemeant thepreliminary destruction of the old governmentalmachinery at its centralseats, Paris and the other great cities of France, and its superseding by realself-government which, in Paris and the great cities, the social strongholds of theworking class, was the government of the working class.*55 Within the politicalframework of the Communal constitution, according to Marx, the Central50 Ibid.pp.330-331.51 Frederick Engels, Letter to August Bebel, March 18-28, 1875, in MECW.Volume 24.p.71.52 Frederick Engels, A Critique of The Draf Social-Democratic Programme of 1891, in MECW.Volume 27.p.227.53eninhTasksftrltriatreentRevLninletedWrkhrVlVol.2, International Publishers,1967,p.15.54Vladimir Lenin,The State and Revolution,in1.LeninSelected Works inThreeVolumes,Vol.2,InternationalPublishers,1967,p.279.55Karl Marx.Second Draft of the Civil War in France,in MECW.Volume 22. p.536.Emphasis mine.

This kind of newsemi-state provided a political form for the proletariat to work out the economicemancipation of labor. According to Engels’ statement, Marx and himself bothsuggested universally substituting Gemeinwesen (means community,“communalbeing", or commonality) for the Proletarian state: “it is a good old German word thatcan very well do service for the French ‘Commune': 58

But, on the other hand, hedeplores incapacities that are actually statist incapacities [incapacitesétatiques]: its weak military centralization; its inability to definefinancial, priorities; and, its shortcomings concerning the nationalquestion,its address to other cities,what it did and did notsay aboutthe war with Prussia, and its rallying of provincial masses.59

But Marx's writings on the Paris Commune and the issue of the state were notambiguous at all. Yes, the old bourgeois state needed to be shattered, especially itsbureaucracy and standing army. However, they should not be completely shattered.Someofthecentralfunctionsoftheoldstatewouldhavetoberetained.Furthermorethe destruction of the old state did not mean the negation of a new type of state,nor asemi-state. The working men, after the smashing of the old bourgeois state, for thepurpose of keeping down its enemies, nationally and internationally, had to establishits own state system in the name of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In this sense.Marx was a proletarian statist, not a bourgeois statist. It is true that Marx in principlepraised the communards'actions to dissolve and disband the old bourgeois statemachineries,asthiswasthesocial andhistorical taskof theproletariat.The actionsthat the Communards had taken, as a matter of fact, inspired Marx to summarizeimportant lessons on the issue of the state. But just like Marx's remarks on the heroicself-sacrifice of the Parisian workers did not necessarily mean that he praised thedefeat of the Commune, Marx's glorification of the communards’ deeds of smashingthe old state did not mean either that he advocated forsaking, when threatened by thecovetous and powerfulenemies in and outsideParis,thepossible statist measures tosave the Commune from perdition. On the contrary, Marx bemoaned that the Central59 Badiou, Alain, 2006, p.262-263.

143Committee should nothave surrendered itspower to the Commune so soon,and thegeneral election, seen as crucial to a commune regime by Marx, took place too earlyThe first and most important concern of the Paris Commune, Marx believed, shouldfocus onstrengtheningitsmilitarypowertoensurethedefeatof theVersaillesenemies and the Commune's survival, not the general election. Even though the oldbourgeois type nation-state of France, as Badiou tells us, was to be dissolved by theParis Commune, Marx held, “the unity of the nation was not to be broken, but, on thecontrary, to be organized by the Communal constitution;*60and the political union ofFrench society, in replacing the old bourgeois centralized state machinery, would beachieved through the Communal organization.?1 This kind of communal organization,actually, was no more than a communal state based on a communal constitution.

In the final analysis, Marx was by no means an anarchist. Just several monthsbefore the Paris Commune, an uprising took place in Lyons on September 4, 1870 dueto the debacle of the French imperial troops at Sedan. As a result, a revolutionaryLyons Commune was set up there. The Lyons Commune, Marx said, correctlyabolished the octrois and armed the whole people, “but the asses, Bakunin andCluseret, arrived at Lyons and spoiled everything."What enraged Marx was that theanarchistBakuninandCluseretissued"foolishdecreesontheabolitiondeT'etat(abolition of the state) and similar nonsense"in Lyons. Marx attributed the failure ofthe Lyons Commune partly to the anarchist foolish abolition of the State, partly to thefact that the French middle class on the whole“prefers Prussian conquest to the60 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France, in MECw.

144victory of a Republic with Socialist tendencies.*62 Obviously, the Lyons Commune,in the eyes of Marx in 1870, should be and was a kind of republic local state powerorgan. After the formation of the Paris Commune, even though Marx claimed that theworking class should break the old bourgeois state, he did not favor the total andimmediateabolitionofthestateastheanarchistsdidinLyons.Instead,thestateshouldbereshaped.Markedly,MarxviewedtheParisCommuneas“thepositiveformof that Republic [with Socialist tendencies]'.63

Engels took his position on the issue of the state more clearly.About onemonth after Marx's death, Engels stated in reply to PhilippVan Patten's inquiry aboutMarx'sattitudetowardsanarchism,

MarxandI,eversince1845,haveheldtheviewthatoneofthefinalresults of thefuture proletarianrevolutionwill be thegradualdissolution and ultimate disappearance of that political organisationcalled theState....Atthesametimewehave alwaysheld,thatinorderto arrive at this and the other, far more important ends of the socialrevolution of the future,the proletarian class will first have topossessitself of the organised political force of the State and with its aid stampout the resistance of the Capitalist class and re-organise society. This isstated already in the Communist Manifesto of 1847,end of Chapter I1.

The Anarchists reverse the matter. They say, that the Proletarianrevolution has to begin by abolishing the political organisation of theState. But after the victory of the Proletariat, the only organisation thevictorious working class finds ready-made for use,is that of the State.It may require adaptation to the new functions. [In Der Sozialdemokratthis sentence reads:'This State may require very important changesbefore it can fulfil its new functions.'] But to destroy that at such amoment, would be to destroy the only organism by means of which thevictorious working class can exert its newly conquered power, keepdown its capitalist enemies and carry out that economical revolution of

society without which the whole victory must end in a defeat and in a62 Marx To Edward Spencer Beesly, October 19, 1870, in MECW. Volume 4.,pp.8889.63 Marx, Karl. The Civil War in France, in MECW. Volume 22. pp.330-331.

145massacreoftheworkingclasslikethataftertheParisCommune

Does it require my express assertion, that Marx opposed theseanarchist absurdities from the very first day that they were started intheir present form by Bakunin?... The result of the five years' strugglewas the expulsion, at the Hague Congress, September 1872, of theAnarchists from the International, and the man who did most toprocure that expulsion was Marx.64

Even though Marx and Engels'ideal was to realize a classless and statelesssociety,thiswasjust theirmaximumprogrammeforthedistantfuture.At a timewhenthe nascent working class, who opposed the powerful expropriators, took arms on alarge scale for the first time, it would be too risky and unrealistic to abolish the wholestate immediately and completely. In fact, Marx and Engels considered the abolitionof classes as thepreconditionfor the abolition of thestate:“The abolition of the statehas meaning with the Communists, only as the necessary consequence of the abolitionof classes, with which the need for the organised might of one class tokeep the othersdown automatically disappears." Then they went on to remark on various versions ofthe“abolitionoftheState",

In bourgeois countries the abolition of the state means that the powerof the state is reduced to the level found in North America. There, theclass contradictions are but incompletely developed; every clashbetween the classes is concealed by the outflow of the surplusproletarian population to the west; intervention by the power of thestate,reducedtoaminimumintheeast,doesnotexistatallinthewestInfeudalcountries theabolitionof thestatemeansthe abolition offeudalism and the creation of an ordinary bourgeois state. In Germanyit conceals either a cowardly flight from the struggles that lieimmediately ahead, a spurious inflating of bourgeois freedom intoabsolute independence and autonomy of the individual, or, finally, the

indifference of the bourgeois toward all forms of state, provided the64 Engels to Philipp Van Patten, 18 April 1883, in MECW. Volume 47.p.10.

146development of bourgeois interests is not obstructed.65

Obviously under the capitalist means of production, without external coloniesor semi-external colonies (e.g., the Indian lands in America, or the colonial andneo-colonial exploitations of the "underdeveloped"localities by"developed"entities),there would be no way to fully develop the so-called civil societies and to truly abortthe repressive state. In a society based upon class antagonisms, to call for the abolitionof the state is actually to call for the set up a new type of state. In a class society, thestate can be reduced,but can never disappear.Before the victorious proletariat madeuseof thestatefortheirownpurposes,theold,bureaucratic,administrativelycentralized state machine could not be used without major transformations. It had tobe, as Engels said, first shattered, then reshaped. And "very important changes" had tobe made.66 The feasible and viable way of coping with the issue of the state for theworking people, could be enacted in accordance with Engels' words, that is, after itsvictorious struggle for class supremacy, the victorious proletariat, just like the ParisCommunards, should lop off at once the worst sides of the state as much as possible,"until such time as a generation reared in new, free social conditions is able to throwthe entirelumber of the state on thescrap heap."6/The proletariat needed the state,and Lenin could not more agree with this. Yet the proletariat needed “only a statewhich is withering away,i.e. a state so constituted that it begins towither awayimmediately, and cannot but wither away. And, secondly, the working people need a6 Karl Marx andFrederick Engel, Reviews From The Neue Rheinische Zeitung.

147'state, i.e., the proletariat organized as the ruling class'*"68 Just in the sense ofgradually withering away, Lenin referred to the proletarian communal state as asemi-state. In the long process of the transformation of the society,meaning thenarrowing of the class differences and the gradual withering away of all classesnationally and internationally, the proletarian state in the form of the dictatorship ofthe proletariat, as transient historical stage, would naturally be withering away. In thissense, "'the State is not * abolished'. It dies out.*69

ClassStrugglein the CommuneState

Marx viewed the Commune as the political form of social emancipation, “ofthe liberation of labor from the usurpation of the (slaveholding) monopolists of themeans of labor, created by the laborers themselves or forming the gift of nature.70Just as it was a form, Marx thought that the Commune was actually not the real life ofthe working class.He said,

As the state machinery and parliamentarism are not the real life of theruling classes, but only the organized general organs of their dominion,the political guarantees and forms and expressions of the old order ofthings, so the Commune is not the social movement of the workingclass and therefore of a general regeneration of mankind but theorganized means of action.7

The real life of the working class, Marx held, lay in its organized action and68 Lenin,The State and Revolution, in V. 1.

Volume 22. p. 490.71Ibid.

148social movement, namely, class struggle. Marx averred, "The Commune does not [do]away with the class struggles."'"According to Marx, the old state machinery of thecapital and landowner class should be replaced by the communal organization, withinwhich the state was first reconstructed as a healthy“Social Republic"then socialtransformation was constructed.73 The Paris Commune could survive at the historicalconjuncture onlyin theform ofa“SocialRepublic".For suchademocraticsocialrepublic, Lenin held, “without in the least abolishing the rule of capital, and, therefore.the oppression of the masses and the class struggle, inevitably leads to such anextension, development, unfolding, and intensification of this struggle that, as soon asit becomes possible to meet the fundamental interests of the oppressed masses, thispossibility is realized inevitably and solely through the dictatorship of the proletariat,through the leadership of those masses by the proletariat. "74 The purpose of classstruggle, initiated by the communal organization, was to abolish all classes and,therefore, all class rule, because the Commune “does not represent a peculiar interestIt represents the liberation of “labor', that is the fundamental and natural condition ofindividual and social life which only by usurpation, fraud, and artificial contrivancescan be shifted from the few upon the many." 75

The highest expression of class struggle within a nation state was no morethan civil war. The Paris Commune“demonstrated the strength of civil war",whichtook place between the expropriator and the expropriated, stirring the socialist72 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France, in MECW.

149movement throughout Europe.'° But arguably, when Marx stated that the Communedid not do away with class struggles,he was not referring to the civil war of winningthe class supremacy of the proletariat, like the Paris-Versailles war. Rather, Marx wastalking about the class struggles after the working people had won the first majorbattle over theexploiters,smashed the old bourgeois statemachinery and establisheda commune state—in Marx's word after the communal organization was firmlyestablished on a national scale.'′ Then when the Commune was “the truerepresentative of all the healthy elements of French society, and therefore the trulynational Government,” why was class struggle necessary and inevitable? The answerlay in the fact that as a working men's government, as the bold champion of theemancipation of labor, the Commune would resolutely be aimed at the expropriationof the expropriators, transforming the means of production, land and capital, chieflythe means of enslaving and exploiting labor into mere instruments of free andassociated labor. Without fulfilling this promise,“the Communal Constitution wouldhave been an impossibility and a delusion. The political rule of the producer cannotcoexist with the perpetuation of his social slavery.',78

The attempt and practice of the expropriation of theexpropriatorswouldunavoidably, trigger fierce resistance from the old class rulers. Marx optimisticallysurmised that after the commune statewas established,“the catastrophesit might stillhave to undergo,would be sporadic slaveholders'insurrections,which,whilefor amoment interrupting the work of peaceful progress, would only accelerate the76 Lenin,Lessons of th Comune, n Lenin on th Paris CommeMscw:PrgressPublishers, 197,p277 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France,in MECW.

150movement, by putting the sword into the hand of the Social Revolution."79Unfortunately, the slaveholders’direct armed offensive successfully prevented aCommune state from coming into being in France. Even though a commune state didmanage to form, once the Commune state tried to advance toward socialism, therecould be many elements, together with the former slaveholders' direct insurrections.contributing to a possible restoration of the old classrule in such a communal stateLet me briefly go through the “healthy elements” consisting of the Paris Commune.Without doubt, the working people were the resolute supporters of the Commune, andthey fought to the end in its defense. But there were still a number of supporters of theold class rule among the workers. For instance, many working people joined thebourgeois troops and fled with the exploiters to Versailles. Secondly, it was true, asMarx stated, “For the first time in history the petty and moyenne middle class hasopenly rallied round the workmen's Revolution, and proclaimed it as the only meansof their own salvation and that of France!Itformswith themthebulkof theNationalGuard, it sits with them in the Commune, it mediates for them in the UnionRepublicaine!80But due to the wavering character of the petty and moyenne middleclass—shopkeepers,tradesmen,merchants,whohad assisted in the suppression of theworking men's insurrection of June, 1848—Marx expressed his deep concern aboutthem: "Whether the gratitude of this great body of the middle class will stand thepresent severe trial, time must show.*81 It turned out that the middle class did notstand the trial in fighting for the Paris Commune, not to mention it could not stand the79 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France,in MECw.

At first this movement was extremely indefinite and confused. It wasjoinedbypatriotswhohoped thattheCommunewouldrenewthewarwith theGermans andbringittoasuccessfulconclusion.Itenjoyedthe support of the small shopkeepers who were threatened with ruinunless there was a postponement of payments on debts and rent (thegovernment refused to grant this postponement, but they obtained itfrom the Commune).

The bourgeois republicans and the petty bourgeoisie soon brokeawayfrom it: theformer werefrightened off by therevolutionary-socialist, proletarian character of the movement; thelatter broke awaywhen they saw that it was doomed to inevitabledefeat....Deserted byitsformer alliesandleftwithoutsupport,theCommunewasdoomed to defeat.The entirebourgeoisieofFrance,allthe landlords, stockbrokers,factory owners, all the robbers,great andsmall, all the exploiters joined forces against it. This bourgeoiscoalition, supported by Bismarck (who released a hundred thousandFrench prisoners of war to help crush revolutionary Paris), succeededin rousing the ignorant peasants and the petty bourgeoisie of theprovinces against the proletariat of Paris, and forming a ring of steelaround half of Paris (the other half was besieged by the Germanarmy).82

Marxhimself frankly admitted thatin the Commune“there areinfluences atwork other than those of the working men.*83 Many of the influences were,apparently,not sopositivefor the survival and advancement of the Commune.Sincethe Commune saved theParisianmiddle class and hence saved the“living civilsociety",thegreatbodyofthemiddleclasswasfullofgratitudeto theCommune.But82 Lenin, In Memory of the Commune,in Lenin on the Paris Commue.

152tosavethelivingcivilsociety”would notbetheultimategoalof theCommunemovement.ForMarx,thetruegoalof theCommunemovementwastoeventuallygetrid of the “living civil society” itself based on private property and the capitalistmeans of production,and liberate the whole society from the state.After discerningthis “socialist tendency” of the Commune, as Lenin pointed out, the middle class inthe Commune was“frightened off by the revolutionary-socialist, proletarian characterof the movement." Furthermore, according to Marx, a major portion of the personnelin the old State machineries serving the interest of the exploiters, for example, thenotaries, huissiers, auctioneers, bum-bailiffs and other judicial officers, wouldautomatically be “transformed into agents of the Commune receiving from it fixedsalarieslike otherworkmen."84But obviously, these kinds of former functionaries ofthe old state could not shift their class stance and political attitude overnightregardless of their service in the new workingpeople's government. Once thesituationwent against thenewpower organ of theworkingpeople andwhen theParisCommune was defeated in the battlefields and collapsing, those old functionaries withhidden class position could become a corrosive force of reactiona.And there was nota lack of resistance, as Lenin pointed out, from the insignificant handful, who werestill strong because of yesterday's money-bags and yesterday's store of knowledgeMany old professors, teachers and engineers, who transformed their knowledge intcan instrument for the exploitation of the working people, might not be verycooperative with the new workers' government.85 The Paris Commune had no time to84 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France, in MECW.

153reorganize public instruction (education), Marx said, "but by removing the religiousand clericalelement from it, the Commune has taken theinitiative in the mentalemancipation of the people.86 Nonetheless, without rapidly training the Proletarianintellectuals and popularizing workers and peasants’ education, without a proletarianeducational revolution,it would bevery toughfor the Communestate tofosterrevolutionary successors and deepen the socialist revolution. For a socialist Communestate, the bourgeoisie, even the“healthy”part of the bourgeoisie, was potentiallydangerous as the “Bourgeoisie will stop at nothing. Today liberals, radicals,republicans, tomorrow betrayal, shootings."8>All these bourgeois elements in aCommune state, would be the objects of class struggle in the course of the socialistadvancement.

Interestinglyenough,Marxcalled attention to another dangerfor thecause ofthe Commune. This danger was from the old revolutionary veterans. Marxexpounded,

In every revolution there intrude, at the side of its true agents, men of adifferent stamp; some of them survivors of and devotees topastrevolutions, without insight into the present movement, but preservingpopular influence by their known honesty and courage, or by the sheerforce of tradition; others mere bawlers, who, by dint of repeating yearafter year the same set of stereotyped declamations against theGovernment of the day, have sneaked into the reputation ofrevolutionistsofthefirstwater.Afterthe18thofMarch,somesuchmen did also turn up, and in some cases contrived to play pre-eminentparts.

In theParis Commune,these kind of old revolutionary veterans, could bethose Blanquists (could be others as Marx did not specify), who believed that, “if asmall well-organised minorityshould attempt toeffect a revolutionary uprising at theright moment, it might, after scoring a few initial successes, carry the mass of thepeople and thus accomplish a victorious revolution." Thereafter, the Blanquists had toestablish an iron-fist dictatorship, not of the entire revolutionary class, the proletariat“"but of the small number of those who accomplished the coup and who themselvesare, at first, organised under the dictatorship of one or several individuals.*89 As apetti-bourgeois socialist,Blanqui,in his book Ni Dieu ni maitre(Neither God noMaster), condemned the theory of class struggle and the separation of the interests ofthe proletariat from those of the nation, drawing no line between the workers and therevolutionary bourgeoisie.'Such viewpoints and practices of the Blanquists withinor outside the Paris Commune would inevitably conflict with the full development ofthe revolution of the working class, thus enabling those old veteran revolutionaries of,and devotees to,pastrevolutions tobe one of theverytargets of class strugglein aCommunestate.The phenomenon that the old veteranrevolutionariesbecame thetargets of newrevolutions,asMarxobserved,was universalineveryrevolution,including the Cultural Revolution which I explore in this dissertation

155insignificantyet influential handful of the uppersection of the workingclass couldrally around the bourgeoisie. In addition, the workers and their political ally—thepeasants, could have no sufficient confidence in their own strength; “age-old traditionhas made them far too used to waiting for orders from above. They have not yet fullyappreciated the fact that the proletariat is the ruling class.""1 As to the issue of thepeasantsforacommunalrevolution,MarxfullyfavoredtheParisCommune'sappeal—“To theWorking People of theVillages",in which the peasants were told thatthe Commune's victory was their only hope.As long as the peasants rallied around thecommunal Republic, they would immediately benefit and soon have confidence in theCommune state.9 But that did not happen partially due to the block ofcommunications by theVersailles forces between theParis Commune and thepeasants. Consequently, the French peasants did not rise up to support the ParisCommune. In a sense, it was the peasants that brought about the downfall of the ParisCommune. In order to secure a revolution in a country with a considerable majority ofthe peasants, the working men's government must take actions to “enable the peasantto directly improve his condition, i.e. to win him over to the revolution." Marxespecially warned that a proletarian government must not sacrifice the interests of thepeasants to serve the revolution. On the one hand, the proletariat needs to facilitate thetransitionfrom theprivateownershipof theland tothecollective ownershipinvillages. On the other hand, the proletariat should avoid antagonizing the peasants andlead the peasants to collective ownership of their own accord. The abolition of the91Lenin,Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets ofWorkers,Soldiers'AndPeasants'Deputies,inVI.LeninSelected Works inThreeVolumes,Vol.2,InternationalPublishers,1967,p.549.92Karl Marx,First Draft of The CivilWar inFrance,in MECW,Volume 22.p.494.

156right of inheritance,or the abolition of his property was possible,“only where thecapitalist tenant farmer has ousted the peasants, so that the actual farmer is as much aproletarian, a wage-laborer, as the urban worker, so that he has the same interests asthe latter directly and not indirectly. Still less should smallholdings be strengthened byincreasing the size of allotments simply by dividing up the large estates among thepeasantry, as in Bakunin's revolutionary campaign."93Inaworkers'state,thepeasants should be the political ally of the workers. They should not be in anantagonistic relationship. But if not handled well, the fierce class struggle between theworking class and the peasants would be imaginable. The result could be disastrous.

Some of the aforementioned elements make class strugglein a communal statepossible, and some make class struggle unavoidable. In a commune state, in which theold bourgeois regime had been toppled, “"the bourgeoisie, whose resistance isincreased tenfold by their overthrow (even if only in a single country), and whosepower lies, not only in the strength of international capital, the strength and durabilityof their international connections [of the bourgeoisie], but also in the force of habit, inthe strength of small production. Unfortunately, small scale production is stillwidespread in the world, and small-scale production engenders capitalism and thebourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly, spontaneously, and on a mass scale.*94Small-scaleproduction of thepeasantswould be an inducementfor the capitalistrestoration. In addition, a portion of the working class, under the influence of thebourgeoisie and petti-bourgeoisie, would degrade into new bourgeois elements.93Karl Marx,Notes onakunin's ookStathoodAndAnarchy, inMECWVolume24.p17.94V.1.Lenin,Left-Wing"Communism,An Infantile Disorder, in V. 1.Lenin Selected Works in Three Volumes,Vol.3,InternationalPublishers,1967,p.339.

Marx assured the people that the Commune “affords the rational medium inwhich that class struggle can run through its different phases in the most rational andhumanway.*'95Marx did not specify what the rational medium meant and what themost rational and human ways were. He did not specify the different phases of classstruggle either. The most possible “rational and human” way of waging class strugglecould be universal suffrage, by which the Parisian working people elected their owngovernment. Marx considered it a key feature of the spirit of the Commune. KarlKautsky hence credited the Paris Commune as being a "pure democracy"as it wasdemocratically elected by universal suffrage, i.e. without depriving the franchise ofthe bourgeoisie and other social groups, which was for him “the deep source ofmighty moral authority." In refuting Kautsky, Lenin pointed out that it was ridiculousto represent the division of the citizens of Paris into two belligerent camps, one ofwhich embraced the entire militant and politically active section of the bourgeoisie, as“pure democracy” with “universal suffrage”.96 That is, Marx's labeling of the Pariselection as“universal suffrage"was not so accurate, as a large portion of the Parisbourgeoisie who fled toVersailles was actually excluded from the general election ofthe Paris Commune.And the women in Paris did not get the right to vote at the time95 Karl Marx, First Draft of The Civil War in France, in MECw.

158of the Commune either.As theParis Commune was merely a rudimentaryform of thedictatorshipof theproletariat,ormore accurately,arevolutionarydemocraticdictatorship, under which the means of capitalist production was not abolished, it waspossible to institute an incomplete“universal suffrage"to form a Communal stateButiftheCommunal statecontinued therevolutiontowardsocialism,“universalsuffrage" could not work well in serving this end. At most, “universal suffrage" couldonly be one form of class struggles employed by various political forces, both in theold bourgeois state and in the new Communal state. In the old bourgeois State, Marxheld, the universal suffrage was to decide once in three or six years which member ofthe ruling class was to misrepresent the people in Parliament."7 Sometimes the rulingclass encouraged the masses to vote. Sometimes not.For example,in order toconsolidate the falling regime, the Second Empire set up a plebiscite, but the Parismembers of theInternational led by Marx told the French peoplepublicly andemphatically that voting in the plebiscite was voting despotism at home and warabroad.98 If the class rulers felt that the universal suffrage did not serve the interestsof the ruling class, say, in a state of emergency or other exception, it would be subjecttosuspense.Revisionism tried tousepoliticalfreedom,democracy anduniversalsuffrage to remove the ground for the class struggle."" But in fact, they were mostlythe manifestations and battle grounds for class struggles. Class struggles would beplayedoutinthesepoliticizedcategories97 Marx, Karl. The Civil War in France, in MECW.

Theuniversalsuffrageisnotacure-allforacommunalstatetoadvancetoward socialism and communism.While believing that a Commune regime couldprovide the most rational and human way to wage class struggle, Marx candidlyadmitted that the Commune“could start violent reactions and as violent revolutions.Once the Communal regime was expropriating the expropriators, it could start violentreactions. When the Communal regime was continuing the revolution to consolidatesocialism andheadforcommunism,it could startviolentreactions aswell.As aChinese proverb goes, “The tree desires stillness but the wind will not subside." Therational medium that a communal regime offered could be turned upside down by theviolent reactions from the opponents of socialism and communism, and from manypeople among the old revolutionary ranks and the working class itself who did notwant to continue the revolution. Lenin, too, as a revolutionary optimist and a realist atthe same time, pointed out the possibility of an unprecedented violent class struggle inthetransitionalperiod

(...Not a single educated liberal will refuse to recognize the classstruggle"in principle"!)[Revisionist] opportunism does not extendrecognition of the class struggle to the cardinal point, to the period oftransition from capitalism to communism, of the overthrow and thecomplete abolition of thebourgeoisie.In reality,this period inevitablyis a period of an unprecedently violent class struggle inunprecedentedly acute forms, and, consequently, during this period thestate must inevitablybe a state that is democratic in a new way (for theproletariat and the propertyless in general) and dictatorial in a new way(against the bourgeoisie).Further. The essence of Marx's theory of thestatehas been mastered onlyby those who realize that the dictatorshipof a single class is necessary not only for every class society in general,not onlyfor theproletariat whichhas overthrown thebourgeoisie,butalso for the entire historical period which separates capitalism from

160"classless society", from communism.100

“Dictatorship, however, is a big word," Lenin warned, “big words should notbe thrown about carelessly." The dictatorship of the proletariat meant democracy forthe have-nots on the one hand, and dictatorship, violence and force not excluded, forthe haves, the proponents of capitalist system and activists of the bourgeoisie on theother. "Dictatorship is iron rule, government that is revolutionarily bold, swift andruthless in suppressing both exploiters and hooligans.*101 In a communal State, theembodiment of the class struggle, as Marx foresaw, could be in the form of violentrevolutions, i.e., civil wars, even international wars, which could be triggered by theviolent reactions on the part of bourgeoisie, internally and externally, in the process ofadvancing socialism and communism. The complexity of the class struggle could, fora time, weaken some typical characteristics of a Commune state, say, the abolition ofbureaucracy and standing army, as Marx hypothesized. Marx held that the safestguarantee against foreign aggression would be the national militia, not the standing

Lenin, in line with Marx's interpretation of the ParisCommune, had long thought that a proletarian Russia should abolish the standingarmy in the first place. But facing tremendous military threats and counterrevolutionsat home and abroad, besides a people's militia, Lenin with his comrades had to set upa standing Red Army. Lenin explained,"The organization of a Red Army was an100 Vladimir Lenin, The State and Revolution, inV I.

161entirely new question which had never been dealt with before, not even theoreticallyMarx once said that it is to the credit of theParis Communards that they carried intoeffectdecisionswhichwerenotborrowedfromsomepreconceivedtheories,butweredictated by the actual necessity."“If the ruling class, the proletariat, wants to holdpower, it must,” Lenin stressed, "prove its ability to do so by its militaryorganization." The consolidation of the proletarian power could not merely depend onuniversalsuffrage.Theproletarian armyhad toutilise"all thatwasmost coerciveandabhorrent in what we had inherited from capitalism.? 103 In regard to one of the twopillars of the modern state, namely, the bureaucracy, Marx, “referring to the exampleof theCommune,showed thatundersocialismfunctionarieswill ceasetobe"bureaucrats', to be ‘officials', they will cease to be so in proportion as—in additionto the principle of election of officials—the principle of recall at any time is alsointroduced, as salaries are reduced to the level of the wages of the average workman.and as parliamentary institutions are replaced by'working bodies,executive andlegislative at the same time' s*104 Slightly differing from Marx's position on the issueof thebureaucracy,Leninpointed out

Abolishing the bureaucracy at once,everywhere and completely,is outof the question. It is a utopia. But to smash the old bureaucraticmachine at once and to begin immediately to construct a new one thatwill make possible the gradual abolition of all bureaucracy--this is not

a utopia, it is the experience of the Commune, the direct and immediate103 V. 1.

162task of the revolutionary proletariat.105

Lenin appeared to be more practical on the issue of the abolishment of thebureaucracy by stating that after a triumphal proletarian revolution, the bureaucracy,though limited, would still exist. Indeed it may exist for a fairly long time, as it wasnot possible to do away with it at once, everywhere and completely. Both Marx andLenin, in envisioning the abolition of the bureaucracy, assumed an ideal circumstancewhich would ensure the socialist and communist direction by merely conductinggeneral elections of the Paris Commune type. However, if the educational level andthe class consciousness of the masses, including a major bulk of the non-proletariatpeople, were not intellectually and politically mature enough to vote for thosecandidates who supported socialism and communism, a capitalist restoration would bequite possible. In such a situation, a revolutionized and limited system of bureaucracywhich was subject to the strict supervision of the masses, could be more efficient inpromoting the socialist and communist agenda. Furthermore, in a state of emergency,for example, in the face of a large-scale bourgeois revolt at home, or a military threat,or intervention by international bourgeoisie, a hierarchical system of the"revolutionized" bureaucracy could be better at mobilizing the masses to ward off thebourgeois offensive. This manifested in Marx's remarks that the Central Committeeshould not hand its power too early to the Paris Commune. In any case, arevolutionized and limited system of bureaucracy,together with an equallyrevolutionized and limited standing army, could exist for a long time before the105 Vladimir Lenin, The State and Revolution, in V. I. Lenin Selected Works in Three Volumes, Vol.2,InternationalPublishers,1967,p.303.

163realization of communism. Only under communism,will the bureaucracy totallydisappear and all administrative work of the society will be run by every commonable man, though authorities will still persist in such a society. Only undercommunism, or when at least the major powers on the globe are socialist, can thestanding army in the socialist states be abolished. The extent of limiting thebureaucracy and the standing army, and the withering away of the State, would solelydepend upon the development of class struggle, nationally and internationally.

The final destiny of a communal state in Marx's strict sense of doing awaywith the standing army and bureaucracy would hinge on the balance of power on aninternational scale, or, more accurately, on the class struggle between the globalproletariat and global bourgeoisie. Marx himself hinted at the precondition of anamiableinternational environmentfor theexistenceof a Communal state,

The working class knows that they have to pass through differentphases of class struggle.Theyknow that the superseding of theeconomical conditionsoftheslaveryoflabor bytheconditions offreeand associated labor can only be the progressive work of time, (thateconomical transformation) that they require not only a change ofdistribution, but a new organization of production, or rather thedelivery(settingfree)of the social forms of productionin presentorganized labor (engendered by present industry) of the trammels ofslavery, of their present class character, and their harmonious nationaland international coordination.106

Yet Lenin realistically expressed his reckoning of a hostile bourgeoisinternational environmentwhentheproletariatseizedpowerwithin onenationstate,most possibly at the weak link of the world capitalist system.He said,106 Karl Marx, First Draftof The Civil War in France,in MECW. Volume 2. p. 491.

164If the exploiters are defeated in one country only—and this, of course.is typical, since a simultaneous revolution in a number of countries is arare exception—they still remain stronger than the exploited,for theinternational connections of the exploiters are enormous.That a sectionof the exploited from theleast advanced middle-peasant, artisan andsimilar groups of the population may, and indeed does, follow theexploitershas beenproved by all revolutions,including the Commune(for there were also proletarians among the Versailles troops, which themost learned Kautsky has “forgotten").107

Therefore, as long as the exploiting class is not toppled and abolishedinternationally, at least in the major capitalist countries, there are still hopes for thebourgeoisie to restore their class rule and recover their lost paradise.Before a decisivevictory of the world proletariat on the global scale, viz. a successful world revolutionof the proletariat, any single communal state based on the so-called "pure democracyout of universal suffrage (as Kautsky suggested),and based solely on thenot-well-trained militia, could suffer a tragic defeat one day. And, “The final victoryof socialism in a single country is of course impossible.108In this sense, theCommunal state is future- and world revolution- oriented. Marx fully understood thisand foresaw the inevitable defeat of the Paris Commune.“The Paris Commune mayfall," Marx stated, “but the Social Revolution it has initiated, will triumph. Itsbirthstead is everywhere."109In conformity with Marx's prediction, the cause of theParis Commune was continued by the working people globally, and by the Chineseworking people in particular107Vladimir Lenin,The Proletarian Revoltion and the RenegadeKautsky, inVILenin Selected Works in ThreeVolumes,Vol.3,InternationalPublishers,1967,p.64..08Lenin,Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers',Soldiers'And Peasants'Deputies,inV.

The classical Marxist writings on the state,which were mainly summarizedfrom the lessons of the Paris Commune, exerted a deep influence upon the ChineseMaoists'theory of continuous revolution and the practice of the CR. Contrary toStalin and Khrushchev's views that in a socialist society there would be nolongersharp class struggles, Mao held that in the historical period of socialism classes, classcontradictions and class struggle would exist for a long time. Mao hence reactivatedMarx's view that after the establishment a Communal state, in progressing toward thesocialist and communist society, the working class could not do away with classstruggles. To continue the revolution, according to Mao, was to wage class strugglescontinuously in such a society. The CR was nothing more than the waging oflarge-scale class struggles based on mass movements under the dictatorship of theproletariat.AccordingtoclassicalMarxistwriters,theParisCommunewas anembodiment of the dictatorship of the Proletariat. Though embryonic, it manifestedtwo important characteristics: It was a workers'power consisting mainly of theworking men, or acknowledged representatives of the working class; it had to advancetoward socialism and communism by exercising dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. Inmany ways, the CR was aimed at fulfilling these two goals by waging intense classstruggles. First, after the large-scale power seizure in 1967 by the working class, alarge number of workers were delegated into the new power organs. Compared to thepre-CR Chinese government, which included very few workers, this was afundamental change.Second,byvirtue of the CR,the Chinese state system wastransformed from the people's democratic dictatorship (stipulated in the 1954

166Constitution), which did not exclude the bourgeoisie from the government and did notcompletely abolish the ownership of the bourgeoisie, to the dictatorship of theproletariat (stipulated in the1975 Constitution),which declared war on thebourgeoisie and their agents within the Party. In keeping with the Marxist theory ofthe state, the new proletarian power organs that emerged during the CR did not intendto abolish the state as a whole. Instead, a wholly newform of state structure based ona triple combination was introduced. In many ways, it anticipated a type of semi-statethat began to initiate the withering-away of the state itself.

167Chapter Three:EnvisioningaWhollyNewForm of

StateStructure

The largest Commune movement in China took place at the height of theGreat Proletarian Cultural Revolution.What was the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution?According to Mao Zedong, it was a revolution in which one classoverthrew another.* Specifically, it was the proletariat overthrowing those agents ofthebourgeoisiewithin the CommunistParty.

Thefundamentalframework that made the CRpossible,both theoreticallyand practically, was Mao's thinking on continuous revolution. The starting point ofMao's theory of continuous revolution is the promise that even though Chinesecommunists took state power in 1949, the class struggles never ceased. In order totransform the Chinese state system from the people's democratic dictatorship to thedictatorship of the proletariat, and to advance Chinese society from semi-capitalism totrue socialism, it was necessary to initiate and wage class struggles against thoseenemies of the proletariat within and outside the communist Party. And then,uninterruptedly, the revolutionaries had to transform the socialist society towardcommunist society over a fairly long historical period under the dictatorship of theproletariat. During this process, the state, as the machinery of suppressing one classby another, would be gradually withering away. In this regard, the Paris Commune, asa specter haunting later generations, has always served as a model for imagination anda point of reference for the continuous revolution. The Paris Commune interpreted inthe classical Marxist tradition was considered by Maoist theoreticians as a model of agovernment of the producers, a semi-state power organ, with all the ready-made1 Chairman Mao Talks to the People,ed. by Stuart R. Schram, Pantheon Books, 1974, p.275.

168bourgeoisstatemachinerysmashed and itsresidualsgraduallywithering away.Thegoal, or the decisive hallmark of the theory of continuous revolution was to preventthe degradation of power-holdersgoing from servants of society to masters ofsociety— and to ward the established socialist society off capitalist restoration. It wasthis concern that underlay Mao and his theoreticians'repeated emphasis onvariousaspects of the Commune state as ways of consolidating dictatorship of the proletariatand steps toward a semi-state and stateless communist society. These include relativeequal wage payments among officials and workers, general elections by the masses,the institutionization of mass organizations, the reduction of police power, thedevelopment of thepeople's militia and soforth.

The CR was by no means an anarchist movement aimed at abolishing the stateas a whole, as post-Mao Chinese regimes and some Western critics have hinted.Rather, based on the theory of continuous revolution, this was an intense classstruggle and great effort to empower the masses by revolutionizing the state so as torelegate some of the state power to them. In order to reach this goal, “a wholly newform of state structure”inspired by the Paris Commune was envisioned and createdby the Maoist revolutionaries. In fact, the explorations and experiments in "a whollynewform of state structure"before and during the CR was one of the mostfar-reaching yet often ignored issues in CR studies. What was this wholly new form ofstatestructure?Howshoulditbeestablished?Whatwasitsnatureandcharacter?How did it differ from other forms of state structures? Tracing its philosophical basisvia a closereading of several representative theoretical texts from that time,I plan todrawabasicblueprint of thisnewform of statestructureenvisionedbytheMaoist

169theoreticians in the current and later chapters. Being a great historical movement, theCR involved multiple dynamics and strategies in a different time and space, fromdifferent leaders at various levels and with the participation of many individualparticipants.A comprehensive historical narrative about the CR is beyond the scope ofthis dissertation,and in this chapter,I will only give rough sketches whereverhistorical background is necessary andfocus on theoretical delineations and textualanalysis.

The Two-line Struggle within the CCP and the Formation of

ContinuousRevolution

Mao'sthinking andpracticeoftheChineserevolution after theproletarianpower seizure in 1949 consisted of two major aspects: advancing from the NewDemocratic Revolution to the Socialist Construction (1949-1965)² and the continuousrevolution under the proletarian dictatorship (1966-1976)— the Cultural Revolutionwhich was seen by the Maoists as a transitional period leading toward communism.The first aspect of Maoist thinking could be regarded as primarily economic while thelatter conceptualization on continuous revolution stressed on cultural, political andideological dimentions. The former mainly included transforming agriculture,handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commence along socialist lines. The best way2According to Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution must go through two stages, “first, the democratic revolution,and second, the socialist revolution, and by their very nature they are two different revolutionary processes. Heredemocracy does not belong to the old category—it is not the old democracy, but belongs to the new category—it isNewDemocracy"(On New Democracy,January1940,from Selected Works of Mao Tse-tungVol.VIl,pp.341-342.Beijing:ForeignLanguagesPress,1975).

170to realize the latter, according to Mao, was through mass movements and specificallyin the form of CRs. The Maoist leadership paid much attention to the issue of creatingsocialist cultural hegemonybetween 1949 and 1965.For example in 1964,Mao's wifeJiang Qing led a campaign to reform the old Peking opera that was viewed to beembedded with feudal and capitalist ideologies.However overall, the achievements inthe cultural fronts during the 17years between 1949 and 1965 did not meet theMaoists'expectations.3

By delineating the formation of Mao's theory of continuous revolution withinits social, historical and political context, I will demonstrate in the next couple ofsections how this theory prepared and prefigured theories and practices in the CR, andI discuss how running battles between the Maoists and those who misunderstood,misinterpreted,ignored or even opposed the theory and practice of continuousrevolution, represented by Liu-Dengists, characterized and underlay a lasting two-linestruggle among top CCP leaders from the beginning of the PRC, and how this leddirectly tothe outbreakof theCR.On the onehand,similar toMao's other theoriesthe conceptualization of continuous revolution both grew out of and was aimedtowardpracticeswithintheChineserevolution.Bycontextualizingitsformation,1will untangle how the theory was rooted in the unique social, historical, and political3 Mao himself (and the Maoist rebels during the CR) basically thought that a “black line" reigned in China on theculturalfront:“Since the Liberation[in1949],most leading units on cultural fronts have been ruled by theanti-Party and anti-socialist blackline represented byZhouYang,whichruncounter to theCentral Committee ofCCP and comradeMao Zedong's working line of culture.Most cultural departments became theirbattlepositionsat which the anti-Party and anti-socialistblackline executed[bourgeois]dictatorship over theproletariat."SeeZhongongzhongyangpizhuanwenhuabuweichediganjinggandiaofandangfanshehuizhuyifanmaozedongsixiangdeheixian erdouzhengdeqingshibaogao(IssuedWithInstructionsFromTheCCPCC:Report byTheMinistry ofCulture onStrugglestoWipeOut theAnti-Party,Anti-Socialist,Anti-MaoZedongThoughtBlackLine），June 26,1966,fromWenhua da geming yanjiu ziliao(Research Materials of the Great Cultural Revolution),Vo1. 1,Beijing: Zhongguo renmin jiefangjun guofang daxue dangshi dangjian zhenggong jiaoyan shi, 1988.)

171conditions in China. The crucial issues it touches upon, on the other hand, are notunique at all. The experience of the CR relates directly to the core of socialism, that is,the question of how socialism can develop and remain strong in a capitalist worldsystem.This is an issue that has perplexed revolutionaries from theParis Communeonwards and from the inception of socialist practices. Yet Mao was never merely atheoretician in the ivory tower but an adamant practitioner. The CR, in that regard, notonly embodied and reified the Paris Commune's spirit but also tested its potentialsand possibilities in a different space and at a different time. Only in light of the theoryand practice of continuous revolution, I argue, can we have a better grasp of theachievements,contributions,andlessonsoftheCRandChineserevolution

In 1949, after nearly 30 years of revolutionary violence against variousenemies, among them, the Japanese invaders and the Guomindang regime, ChineseCommunist Party finally seized state power and established thePeoples Republic ofChina. Right before the founding of the PRC, the CCP, together with numerous"democratic parties and people's organizations", drafted the “Common Program ofthe Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference” passed by the first plenarysessionoftheChinesePeople'sPoliticalConsultativeConferenceonSeptember29th1949 in Beijing. This functioned as a “temporary constitution" during the first fiveyears of thePRC untilit was replaced by the official1954constitution.This"temporary constitution" proclaimed that “the People's Republic of China is a NewDemocratic or a People's Democratic state."""The Chinese people's democraticdictatorship is the state power of the people's democratic united front of the Chinese

172working class, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie and otherpatrioticdemocraticelements."It alsodeclared theobjectiveto"protect theeconomicinterests and privateproperty of workers,peasants,thepettybourgeoisie and thenational bourgeoisie” and “develop the people's economy of New Democracy andsteadily transform the country from an agricultural into an industrial one."4 This waslargely based upon Mao's theory of New Democracy expounded in wartimeAccording toMao's classification of revolutionary stages,China stepped into atransitional period from the New Democratic Revolution to the socialist constructionfrom 1949 onwards, that is, a period of socialist transformation. During thistransitional period, even though the working class was the leading political force andChina was a people's democratic dictatorship founded on the worker-peasant alliance,four revolutionary classes, namely, the working class, the peasants, the pettybourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie, led China cooperatively and shared statepower with one another.In other words at this stage,China was a republic under thejoint dictatorshipofseveralrevolutionaryclasses.Thisstagelasted aboutfiveyears(1949-1954). Since the “Common Program of the Chinese People's Political4See Zhongguo renmin zhengzhi xieshang huiyi gongtong gangling (The Common Program of the ChinesePeople'sPoliticalConsultativeConference),inPeople'sDaily1949,9,30.TheEnglish translation canbefound intheImportantDocuments of theFirstPlenarySessionof theChinesePeople'sPolitical Consultative Conference(Peking: Foreign Languages press, 1949), pp. 1-20.5Mao says,“Revolutions too can be classified into old and new, and what is new in one historical period becomesold in another.The century of China's bourgeois-democratic revolution can be divided into two main stages,a firststage of eightyyears and a second of twentyyears.Each has itsbasichistorical characteristics:China'sbourgeois-democratic revolution in the first eighty years belongs to the old category,while in the last twenty years,owing to the change in the international and domestic political situation, it belongs to the new category. Olddemocracy is the characteristic of the first eighty years. New Democracy is the characteristic of the last twenty.This distinction holds good in culture as well as in politics."(On New Democracy/xin minzhu zhuyi lun], January1940,from Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung Vol. VII pp.341-342. Beijing:Foreign Languages Press, 1975) Maoherein effect divides theChineseRevolution intoseveral stages:the OldDemocraticRevolutionfrom1840 to1919,led by the bourgeoisie;the New Democratic Revolution after 1919,led by the working class and other jointrevolutionary classes,and thesocialistrevolutionled by theproletariatwhen theNewDemocraticRevolutionhasbeen accomplished.In the stage of theNewDemocraticRevolution,thepettybourgeoisie and thenationalbourgeoisie are not its objects but rather the subjects and driving forces and thus allies of the proletariat.

173Consultative Conference”was just a “temporary constitution", the direction of theNew Democracy, according to Mao's theory, should gradually lead to the socialistorientation. At this stage, however, China practiced a special kind of capitalism, i.estate capitalism, as Mao clearly stated.° It was merely a transitional period towardsocialist revolution; China must step into the next stage——the socialist revolutionunder the leadership of the working class. In this process, the working class wouldgain more power over other classes, and others, such as the national bourgeoisie.would eventually lose ground in the leadership of state power. In fact, Mao began tcprepare for a socialist general line for the transitional period as early as 1952, that is.in the middle of the KoreanWar. At a meeting of the Secretariat of the CCP CentralCommittee that year, he insisted that it would take 10 to 15 years to complete thistransitionalprocesstosocialism.And if therehad been noKoreanWar,the socialisttransformationmight havebeenput on the agenda even earlier

Right after the Korean War in 1953, China began to carry out many economictransformationstorealizethistransition.Meanwhile,the1954ConstitutionofthePeople's Republic of China was promulgated by the 1st National People's Congressmeeting in Beijing on September 20, 1954,and it stated:

From the founding of thePeople's Republic of China to the attainmentof a socialist society is a period of transition. During the transition thefundamental task of the state is, step by step, to bring about thesocialistindustrialization of the country and,stepbystep,toaccomplish the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and

capitalist industry and commerce. In a few short years our people have6MaoZedong,About the State Capitalism (guanyu guojia zibenzhuyi),in Selected Works of Mao Tse-tungVol.V.,Beijing:ForeignLanguagesPress,1977.

174successfullycarriedout aseriesoflarge-scalestruggles:thereform ofthe agrarian system, resistance to American aggression and aid toKorea,the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and therehabilitationof the national economy. As a result, the necessary conditions havebeen created for planned economic construction and gradual transitiontosocialism.

From 1953 to 1956,as the 1954 constitution hoped, private enterprisesunderwent fundamental changes, transformed from private ownership tojoint-ownership by the state and the private enterprises.。At the same time, autarkicalsmall-scale farming completed its corresponding socialist transformation as wellthrough a gradual process of mutual aid teams, elementary and advanced agriculturalproducers'cooperatives, and the people's communes.The state took control ofownership as representative of the entire people.As such, the Chinese economicsystem as a whole realized socialist public ownership of the means of production. By1956, therefore, China had successfully gone through the transitional period andenteredanewstageofsocialistrevolution.YetthisfurtheradvancementfromtheNewDemocratictothesocialistrevolutionencounteredmanyobstaclesandevenfar-reaching resistance form both within and outside the CCP. Liu Shaoqi, thechairman of PRC, for example,was a leading representative who viewed that the mostimportant task at the time was to consolidate the so-called “New Democratic socialorder", not to move toward socialism.” In fact, Liu Shaoqi, together with his alliesConstitutionof thePeople'sRepublic of China(zhonghua renmin gongheguoxianfa),20September1954,inThePeople's Republic of China:1949-1979,A Documentary Survey,Vol.1, p.99,ed.Harold C.Hinton,Wilmington,Del:ScholarlyResourcesInc.,1980.8 In 1966 after the first wave of the CR, the means of production in cities finally came fully under publicownership.SeeTransmitted by The CCPCC:Report by theOffice ofFinanceand Tradeand theStateEconomicCommission of theStateCouncil ConcerningSomeFinance andTrade andHandicraft IndustryPolicies,Sept.24,1966,inZhonggong zhongyang wenjian huibian(The CollectedDocuments of the CCP CC,1966.5-1968.5),published inMay1968,editorsunknown.Liu's view was refuted by Mao in a speech at a meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of theCCP.Mao said,"Firmly establish the new-democratic social order.'That's a harmful formulation.In the transition

175(for example, Bo Yibo, Liu Lantao and Deng Zihui, An Ziwen etc.), opposed themovement of cooperative transformation of agriculture at the time.1° Liu Shaoqi'sargument was that the mechanization of agriculture must take placefirst before anycollectivizationastherewereneithertractorsnorfertilizers.ForLiuShaoqi,theconditions for collectivization were far from mature at the beginning of 1950s.11Nevertheless, had China followed Liu Shaoqi's plan, the collectivization ofagriculture could have been postponed forever, since even today it is still hard todescribe Chinese agriculture as being mechanized. Contrary to Liu Shaoqi's plan,Mao insisted on collectivizing before the mechanization of agriculture, arguing thatonly through collectivization could rural China accumulate enough funds throughcollective efforts to purchase industrial machines and tohave agriculture mechanized.For industry and commerce, Liu Shaoqi openly supported the continued bourgeoisownershipofbusinesses,puttingforwardhisfamouspropositionthat“exploitationperiod changes are taking place all the time and socialist factors are emerging every day. How can this ^newdemocratic social order' be“firmly established'?.. Our present revolutionary struggle... will bury the capitalistsystem and all other systems of exploitation once and for all. The idea,‘Firmly establish the new-democratic socialorder',goes against the realities of our struggle and hinders the progress of the socialist cause.”(See“Refute RightDeviationistViewsThatDepartFromTheGeneral Line”(pipanlikaizongluxiandeyouqingguandian),June15,1953,From the Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung, Vol.V, pp. 93-94. Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1977.)10LiuShaoqi and some other top CCPleaders, suchasBo Yibo and LiuLantao,strongly opposed formingagricultural co-operatives throughfurther developing mutual aid unionsinShanxiProvincein1951.Shanxi cadresin favor of supporting the existing co-operatives run by peasants who on their own initiatives formed newco-operatives were severely criticized by Liu and his men.In May 7,1951,at the National Working Meeting forPropaganda,Liu sternly criticized thoseShanxi cadres,saying that the activity toform co-operatives was amanifestation of“agricultural utopian socialism”,“it is impossible to realize”,and:“Within our party, alargenumber of our comrades buy into this kind of agricultural utopian socialism, which should be corrected."But someShanxi cadreswho did not agree withLiu's view directlywrote toMaoZedong.In response to their letter,Maofirmly supported theseShanxi cadres and criticized Liu and hislike.SeeShanxi shiban quanguo shoupinongyehezuoshedeqianqianhouhou:TaoLujiafangtanlu(TheFirstExperimentsinShanxiofFormingagriculturalCo-opsWithin theEntireCountry:InterviewwithTaoLujia"),inDangdewenxian(TheParty'sLiterature),2008No.5. 1955 saw a nationwide upsurge in agricultural cooperation in response to Mao's call. Yet when Mao Zedongwas not in Beijing that year,Deng Zihui, minister of the Department of Rural Work,proposed to Liu Shaoqi toretrench and dissolve 200,000 co-operatives. Liu Shaoqi approved his plan and ordered the dismantling all of the200,000 cooperatives in alittle over two months.SeeLiu Shao-Ch'i'sSelf Criticism(LiuShaoqi deziwopiping),October,1966,inHarold C.Hinton,ed.,ThePeople's Republic of China1949-1979,vol.31965-1967TheCultural Revolution Part I,p.1621.Wilmington,Del:Scholarly ResourcesInc.1980.ISeeBoYibo,ARecollectionofSomeImportantDecisionsandEvents Ruoganhongdajuece yu shijiandehuigu), 2 vols.pp 187-188.Beijing:Zhonggong zhongyang dang xiao chubanshe,1993.

176has its merits.*'12

What underlay this divergence is a tense two-line struggle within the CCP thathad gradually developed since the founding of thePRC in1949. Opposing Liu Shaoqigroup's stubbornresistance to the socialist transformations inthe economicspheres,Mao warned that even though the socialist mode of production was basically attainedin China in 1956, there was still be a long road to fight against capitalist restoration.Based upon such misgivings, Mao gradually produced his theory of continuousrevolution. The earliest expression of Mao's thinking on continuous revolution couldarguably be tracded back to the middle 1950s. In his famous article “On the CorrectHandling of Contradictions among the People”(lun zhengque chuli renmin neibumaodun)in1957,Maoclaimed:

In China, although socialist transformation has in the main beencompleted as regards the system of ownership,and although thelarge-scale, turbulent class struggles of the masses characteristic oftimes of revolutionhave in themain come to an end,there arestillremnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador classes, there isstill a bourgeoisie, and the remoulding of the petty bourgeoisie hasonly just started. Class struggle is by no means over. The class strugglebetween the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle betweenthe various political forces, and the class struggle between theproletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological field will still beprotracted and tortuous and at times even very sharp.1

In this article, Mao contended that the class struggle would exist in the longterm. He stated that the danger for capitalist restoration of socialist China would come12 See“Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside”, by the EditorialDepartments of“RenminRibao,”“Hongqi'”and “Jiefangjun Bao", in Peking Review, No.49,December 1,1967,p.123From Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung Vol. V. p. 409, Beijing: Foreign Languages Press, 1977.

177from the“remnants"of the overthrown old exploiting classes and the pettybourgeoisie. As time wore on, the major threat to the party would be re-identified byMao tobe the“capitalist roaders"within theParty whorepresented the interests of thebourgeoisie. The way to stay away from this formidable danger would be a kind of“permanence of the revolution" in Marx's sense,and an"uninterruptedrevolutionas Mao stated in January 1958 in the 11" article—"Uninterrupted Revolution" in theParty document “The Sixty Articles for Working Methods (Draft)": "Our revolutioncomes one by one.*'15

While Mao was determined to advance the revolution uninterruptedly, LiuShaoqi and some other top leaders were inclined to keep China on a state capitalisttrack, even though they had to implement some projects along Mao's line because ofMao's widespread and deep influence. In fact, the resistance to the socialist road camenot only from civilian officials such as Liu Shaoqi, but also from high-rankingmilitary officials. Peng Dehuai, for example, a valiant general who gloriously andvictoriously commanded the Chinese army during the Korean War, was not satisfiedwith the collectivization of agriculture, especially the Great Leap Forward, after helearned of the dire consequences of the“wind of exaggeration"and the“wind ofcommunism"16when visiting his rural hometown in Hunan Province at the end of14 14 Karl Marx, The Class Struggles in France 1848 to 1850,in MECW.Volume 10, p.127.15 From Mao Zedong wenji (Mao Zedong Works) Vol. 7, p.349, Beijing: Renmin chubanshe, 1999.16 During the Great Leap Forward, there occurred five types of serious left adventurist deviations (or using Maoistdiscourse, “left' in form yet right in essence), plotted mainly by Liu-Dengist cadres in a fairy large number of ruralareas.The five deviations were named as the“five winds"or"five styles"(wufeng):“The Communist wind";“thewind of exaggeration"(fukua feng);“the commandist wind”(mingling feng); “the wind of cadre privileges"(ganbu tequan feng);and“the wind of blindly leading production"(xiazhihui shengchan feng).Among them,theCommunistwindwasblown by some cadres whobelieved that Communismwould be somethingwhich could beachieved overnight rather than through adrawn-out transition in thelongrun.A typical result of thewind ofcommunism was known as “one equalization and two transfers" (yi ping er diao), i.e., egalitarianism in all aspectsof life and unrestricted transfer of brigade manpower and materials by commune authorities.The“wind ofexaggeration”was a manifestation of failure to carefully investigate actual conditions.The most serious"wind of

1781958.InApril1959,PengDehuailed a militarydelegation tovisit tosomeEasternEuropean countries during which he harshly criticized the “personality cult ofleaders",“the wind of exaggeration and communism" during the Great Leap Forwardand even communization itself on several occasions.17 In May 1959 when visitingAlbania, Peng Dehuai informally chatted several times with Khrushchev who hadbeen labeled by the CCP as an unfriendly revisionist and national chauvinist since hehad criticized China's Great Leap Forward and promoted a revisionist theory andpractice of "peaceful co-existence" with and "peaceful transition" of capitalistcountries.Even though Peng may have talked of nothing of real importance withKhrushchev, their similar harsh criticism of the Great Leap Forward andcommunization connected these two together later in some people's views.Set againstthis background,Peng Dehuai submitted a so-called“ten-thousand-word"letter toMao Zedong1° at the Lushan conference in July 1959 which actually targetedLiu-Dengists who were practically in charge of the launch of Great Leap Forward. Inthis letter and in other talks at the Lushan conference, Peng Dehuai claimed that therewas much "petty-bourgeois fanaticism" in the Great Leap Forward, and argued thatthe agricultural collectivization movement was “too hasty” and “very bad".19 In a talkwith Huang Kecheng on July 19, Peng Dehuai point to the third version of The Sovietexaggeration”was reporting false output figures either in fear of punishment for lagging behind or in hope ofwinningpraise.(SeeFrederickC.Teiwes,PoliticsandPurgesinChina:Rectificationand theDeclineofPartyNorms,1950-1965,pp.352-359. M.E. Sharpe,1993) Because of the“five winds", serious famine occurred inseveral provinces controlled by adamant Liu-Dengist bureaucrats, such as Anhui, Sichuan, He'nan and Shandong.Frederick C. Teiwes(1993)believed that taking an overallview,both Mao and Liu Shaoqi were particularly harshin denouncing "the Communist wind" as exploiting and robbing the peasants,but according to my study,LiuShaoqi, together with Deng Xiaoping, was big agitator of the winds of communism and exaggeration.17Wang Yan,Peng Dehuai nianpu (A Chronicle of Peng Dehuai's Life),Beijing:Renmin chubanshe,pp.735-744,1998.18 Literally, the letter has only 3,500 words.From the Failure of Peng Dehuai tothe ankruptcy of the Chinese Khrushchey, in Red Flag,No.13,August 17,1967.

179TextbookthePoliticalEconomy,wheretherewasdiscussionoftheearlySovietagricultural communes and how as the agricultural productivityintheSovietUnionright after theviolentrevolutionwasverylow,themandatory communizationregardless of material insufficiency ended up in rapid disintegration. In reference tothis example Peng asked, "when others had lessons,why should we repeat it?" In thisregard, Peng's basic premise of communization was in fact similar to Liu Shaoqi'sviewpoint favoring mechanization before collectivization.

What really contributed to the downfall of Peng Dehuai at Lushan was not hisviewpoints and harsh criticism about the Great Leap Forward.It lay somewhere else.Peng went so far as to assert on several occasions that ‘if the Chinese workers andpeasants were not as good as they are, a Hungarian incident would have occurred inChina and it would have been necessary to invite Soviet troops in."20Withtheprevious lessons of the Soviet coup d'état against the Stalinists, this kind of remarkshocked the CCP leadership including Mao. Mao himself did not want to punish Pengandhislikeforhisharshremarks aboutthepeople'scommunes andtheGreat LeapForward. But Mao had to agree with the Liuists to launch a campaign against Pengmainlyforhisrole andmisgivings on theSino-Soviet relationshipunder greatpressure from the Liuist group.In order tomaintain the unity of the party,a resolutionwas passed to condemn "the Anti-Party clique headed by Peng Dehuai."21 In the final20Resolution of 8th Plenary Session of 8th Central Committe of CCP Concerning the Anti-Party Clique Headedby Peng Teh-huai (Excerpts), delivered on August 16, 1959,in Peking Review, No. 34,August 18. 1967.21What drove Liuists to punish Peng at Lushan were quite different reasons. As can be seen, in regard to thePeople's communes,the attitudes of Peng Dehuai and Liuists had no major differences; they both were not soenthusiastic with this movement.Some scholars even suspect that blowing up the so called"communist wind"wasa deliberate attempt by the Liu-Dengists to sabotage the Great LeapForward designed by Mao.In fact,after theLushanmeeting,Liu Shaoqi openly criticized the general line as havingbeen put forthblindly,the Great LeapForward as being“brought about in a rush"causing the economy to be“out of balance;”that“the people's

180roundof criticism,Peng and"his accomplices andfollowers"were declared as"essentiallyrepresentativesof thebourgeoisiewhojoinedourPartyduringthedemocratic revolution.""Peng joined the Party and the revolutionary army led by theParty with an idea of ^investing in a share.'..his anti-Party activities reflect the kindof class struggleinwhich theChinesebourgeoisie opposes theproletariansocialistrevolution and attempts to remold the Party, the army and the world in its ownbourgeois image."'22This conclusive statement, though an official document of theParty, in fact embodied Mao's thinking on the continuous revolution. It clearlyrevealed that it was very likely that the capitalist restoration in China might not be ledby the old reactionaries any more, but by the representatives of the bourgeoisie whojoined the Party, i.e."the party persons in power taking the capitalist road." The targetfor preventing capitalist restoration therefore shifted from those outside of theparty tothoseinside theparty at thehighestlevels ofleadership.Maolatergeneralized thiscommunes were set up too early,"and“here is the danger of disintegration."He even made the assertion that“heLushan meeting made a mistake,"and that“t was wrong to oppose right opportunism."(SeePeng Teh-huai and HisBehind-the-Scenes Boss Cannot Shirk Responsibility for Their Crimes,Peking Review,No.35,August 25.1967.p.7.) The point at issue here is the power struggles between the Liuists and Peng Denghuai's military group.Somescholars such asLaoTian[seehisxinzhongguowushinianlaijingyingjiecengneibumaodunfenxi(AnAnalysis oftheContradictionsWithintheEliteintheFiftyYearsoftheNewChina),http://www.wyzxsx.com/xuezhe/laotian/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=35accessed April1 2o09]hold that thispower strugglebetween thePeng andLiu groups embodies thelong-enduringdiscontent and distrust in the armed struggle era between an army group who got huge historical credits incommunist-controlled areas,namely,“Red Area",and cadres who worked undergroundin Guomindang-controlledareas, namely, the “white territory.” Peng Dehuai, a representative of the army group, took the view that since theycontributed more to the establishment of PRC, they should wield more power than those in the“white territory”,represented by Liu Shaoqi. Yet after liberation, most important positions were assigned to the latter. As PengDehuai wanted to hold Liuists responsible for many errors and excesses in the Great Leap Forward,so as to seizepower from them, the counter strike by the powerful Liuist group was decisive and the destiny of Peng's politicallife was hence doomed, since Mao was also not satisfied withPeng's open opposition to the Great LeapForwardandespeciallyhisdubitabletalkaboutinvitingintheSovietRedArmy.Maohadpartlyretiredfromthedecision-makingcorein1958before the Lushan conference in order to allow more room for his successors.But heremained a stronginfluence in the party and the whole country.And this timeMao sidedwith Liuistgroup,since atleast ostensibly, at the Lushan conference, the Liu Shaoqi group supported the “three red banners", that is, thegeneral line,the Great Leap and thepeople's communes that had been theoretically designed byMao at the time.But the final verdict passed at the meeting about Peng's “crime” was basically due to his possible connection withtheunfriendlySovietregime at thetime.22Resolution of 8&th Plenary Sessionof 8thCentral Committee of C.P.C.Concerning the Anti-Party Clique HeadedbyPengTeh-huai,PekingReview,No.34,August 18.1967

181conflict as a "two-line" struggle within the party.23

By exaggerating the partial failure of the Great Leap Forward, which had ineffect been executed by Liu-Dengists of the first front (yixian)with Mao himselfpresiding at the second front (erxian)," Liu Shaoqi claimed in 1962 that “thepeasants have gained nothing from the collective economy in the last few years.*25Such remarks showed that Liu attempted toshift responsibilityfor the partialfailureof the Great Leap Forward onto others, mainly Mao,who was the major architect andproponent of theGeneral LineforSocialistConstruction and theGreat LeapForward."Don't be afraid of capitalism running amok,” Liu Shaoqi openly contended, “the freemarkets should continue to exist,”and“wemust fall back as far as necessaryboth inindustry and in agriculture,evento the extent offixing output quotasbased on theindividual households and allowing individual farming!26DengXiaopingelaboratedthis in a figurative way. “So long as it raises output, ^going it alone' is permissible,"he argued, “Whether cats are white or black, so long as they can catch mice, they aregood cats.*27 With the support of Liu-Dengists, a wind of san zi yi bao blew up inmany rural areas. San zi yi bao is translated as three selfs and one contract literally.23For example, Mao argued on Dec. 27,1964,“there are at least two factions in our party: one is socialist faction,and theother capitalist.”SeeRemarks at the CCP CCWorkMeeting(zaizhongyang gongzuohuiyi shang dechahua),inLongLiveMaoZedongThought(MaoZedong sixiangwansui),Vol.5,p.199,printedinWuhan,1967-1968; when talkingwith Mehmet Shehu, a leader of Albanian Party of Labor in May1966,Mao says,"whoever will win?Marxist-Leninists or Revisionists?It is an issue of two line struggle.”(Mentioned in Talk withcomradeKarboandBaluku(hekabo baluku tongzhide tanhua),Feb.3,1967,fromLongLiveMaoZedongThought(Mao Zedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.288,printed in Wuhan,1967-1968.24 At the end of 1953, after learning lessons from the Soviet Union on the issue of successors after Stalin's death,MaoZedongproposed that thework of CCPleadershipbe split into afirst front(yixian)and a secondfront(erxian).Thetop cadres whoworked at Central Committee,government and army were tobe on theyixian;whereas those on the erxian did not exercise direct leadershipbutfunctioned as advisers and influencedpolicymaking from behind the scenes.(See HenryYuhai He,Dictionary of the Political Thought of thePeople'sRepublic of China, p.101, M.E. Sharpe, 2001.) At the time of the Great Leap Forward, Mao was literally sitting onthesecondfront.25See“Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside",by the Editorial Departments of"RenminRibao,""Hongqi" and "Jiefangjun Bao", in Peking Review, No. 49, December 1, 1967, p.15.26 Ibid.27 Ibid.

182Three zi means practicing private plots,free markets, profit-driven small enterprisesand one bao means requiring fixed output quotas on a household basis.28Contrarytothe contemporary mainstream narrative, san zi yi bao resulted in disastrous damage toagricultural production.The reasonwhysanzi yi baodid not worklayinthefact thatthevulnerableindividualfamilieswhichconductedsanziyibaocouldnotensurestableyieldswhen theyencounteredsevereweatherconditionssuch asdrought onexcessive rain in those years. Consequently, grain production decreased rapidlyresulting in wide-spread famine in those areas.29 This is what the mainstreamnarrative intentionally hides. Had the san zi yi bao propagated in China, the people'scommune, which the Maoists had considered the “gold bridge to communism" andhad painstakingly organized and practiced for years, would have collapsed in no timewithout a doubt.3°Mao clearly pointed out the dire consequences of the ruin ofcommuneslater:

Why doI see the practice of household responsibility system soseriously? China is a big agricultural country. If the foundation of thesystem of ownership in rural areas changes, the industrial foundationthat serves thecollective economy[of agriculture]would beundermined, and the public ownership ofindustry would changeaccordingly overnight. There would emerge a polarization between thepoor and the rich rapidly. ...When the time comes, how could we

communists defend theinterest of theworkers and peasants?How28 With san zi yi bao, Liu-Dengists aimed to promote the extension of plots for private use, the extension of freemarkets, an increase in the number of small enterprises with sole responsibility for their own profits or losses, andthe fixing of output quotas on the basis of individual households. In the eyes of the Maoists, this was going downtheroad of capitalist restoration.29CaoWeiping,CaoAnhui Chuxian denongyekan dayuejing hebaochan daohu(On the Great LeapForwardandtheHouseholdResponsibilitySeenFromtheCaseofChuCounty,AnhuiProvince),http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=15489,cited 28,March,2009.60In fact, all of these practices of san zi yi bao reemerged after the CR whenDengXiaoping took power.

183could we defend the national industry and commerce?..31

In response to the Liu-Dengists′ challenge at this critical moment, MaoZedong convened the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of theCCP in the autumn of 1962, at which Mao sharply criticized and repudiated theLiu-Dengists”“capitalist line” and deterred the wind of “san zi yi bao" and thecorresponding effort to dissolve thePeople's Communes.It is also at this meeting thatMao called on the entire Party and the masses throughout the country to“never forgetclass struggle” and set the task of “socialist education".32 The Socialist EducationMovementwashencelaunchedbetween1962 and1966.Alsoreferred to as the“fourcleans movement,”it aimed at cleaning up the Party politically, economicallyorganizationallyandideologically

The original goal of the “four cleans movement" set by Mao in “The Decisionof the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Some Problems inCurrent Rural Work'(that is, The Ten-point Decision) was to struggle against "Partypersons in power taking the capitalist road"',and its nature was identified ascontradictions between socialism and capitalism. But things went temporarily againstMao's plan.After sitting at the second front (erxian)for several years,Mao officiallystepped down from the No. 1 position in 1962, hoping to give his successors, LiuShaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, more chances to develop their leadership capabilitiesNevertheless, being Mao's successors and in charge of the “four cleans movement",Liu and Deng boldly altered Mao's original policies in their “Second Ten-point31MaShexianghePreludeMaZedongReascendingJinggangMountainin1965Qianou:MaZedongyijiuliuwu nian chongshang jinggangshan),Beijing: Dangdai zhongguo chubanshe, 2006.3See“StruggleBetween theTwoRoads in China'sCountryside",by theEditorialDepartments of“RenminRibao,”“Hongqi'”and “Jiefangjun Bao", in Peking Review, No.49,December 1,1967,p.16.

184Decision(draft)"in1963 and the“Revised Draft oftheSecond Ten-pointDecision(draft)" in 1964. The latter two documents by Liu and Deng were in direct oppositionto Mao's"Ten-point Decision"in 1962. In the new documents by Liu and Deng, themovement'snaturewassetas"thecontradictionbetweenthe‘fourcleans'andthefour uncleans"” and“the intertwining of the contradictions inside and outside theParty." Thus unsurprisingly, they designated the main struggle targets as thelower-middle cadres and the common masses with bad family backgrounds, causingwidespread sufferings yet missing the targets that had been set by Mao, that is, Partymembers in power taking the capitalist road. Discontented with Liu's leadership andhis wife Wang Guangmei's oppressive behaviors in the “four cleans movement”" in1964, Mao Zedong ordered the drawing up of a document called “Some ProblemsCurrentlyArising in the Course of theRural Socialist EducationMovements"(that is,The 23-articleDocument) the sameyear so as torectifyLiu'smistakes in thismovement, and to consolidate people's communes in rural areas. It was in this paperthat the concept of “Party persons in power taking the capitalist road" (zou ziben zhuyidaoludedangquanpai),capitalistroaders(zouzipai)inshort,first appearedinaCCPdocument.Itclearlystatedthatthekeypointof thismovementistorectifythosepeople in positions of authority within the Party, who take the capitalist road, and toprogressively consolidate and develop the socialist battlefront in the urban and ruralareas.*33 So who were capitalist roaders? This question actually puzzled millions of3SomeProblems CurrentlyArising intheCourseof theRuralSocialist EducationMovement,January141965,inSsu Ching:The Socialist Education Movement of 1962-1966 byRichard Baum and Frederick C.Teiwes,University of California,Berkeley,1968,fromLongLive MaoZedong Thought(MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.280,printed in Wuhan, 1967-1968.

185people during the ensuing CR. Indeed, this question had no easy answer. This mightexplain why there were so many ambiguities and complexities in the CR that involveda lot of conflicts andviolence.ButinMao's eyes,somepowerholders,without anydoubt, should be relegated to being called “capitalist roaders". When discussing thedraftofThe23-articleDocument,Maosaid：

During the first half part of the year of 1962, there blew a “wind ofindividual farming(danganfeng)";and[at the same time]thereappeared a wind of san ziyi bao and a wind of sanhe yi shao(threereconciliations[withimperialists,reactionaries andmodernrevisionistsof foreign countries.] and onereduction[ofsupport and assistance tothe liberation struggles of other peoples.J) How strong were the winds!As for the“wind of individualfarming",Deng Zihui was among theadvocates. There are also several other people [who advocated this].Some comrades took the lessons, but some not. They did not speak andanswer questions. It has been manyyears for us to build socialism.After listening [to thelessons], some comrades still did not speak,andcannot answer questions....Why do I talk about the current situation?Because somepeople said that unless installing“bao chan daohu"(the household responsibility system), the Chinese economy could notrecover within eight or ten years. To build socialism or capitalism?This is class struggle. That's why I bring forward the issue of whetheror not there exist classes, class conflicts and class struggles...Thecrucial point is to struggle against the power holders taking thecapitalist road...34

Obviously for Mao, the power holders in the Party who actively advocatedindividual farming and the household responsibility system and were indifferent to theworld revolution deserved the title of“capitalist roader."But in the written version ofThe 23-article Document, publicly released on January 14,1965, there was never aclear definition of “capitalist roader". It just stated that"the great majority of our34Mao,SpeechDelivered at theCCPCCWorkMeeting (zaizhongyang gongzuo huiyi shang de jianghua),December 28,1964,from Long Live Mao Zedong Thought (Mao Zedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.199,printed inWuhan,1967-1968.

186cadreswanttotakethesocialistroad,buttherearesomeamongthemwhohavebutahazy knowledge of the socialist revolution, who employ personnel improperly, whoare haphazard about checking up onwork,and who commit the mistake ofbureaucratism." Seen from here, the“capitalist roaders” seemed to consist mainly ofbureaucratists (guanliao zhuyi zhe). If so,no cadre dared to say that he was immune toany bureaucratism. Practically, all cadres could be targeted as “capitalist roaders” dueto any of their mistakes in work. Moreover, even though the so-called “capitalistroaders"were thepivot onwhich the CR revolved,it seemed that there never publiclyappeared a clear definition for it by the Maoist leadership during the entire CR

Nevertheless,Mao's theory of continuous revolutiongradually tookits shapeafter running battles within the party against the Peng Dehuai group in 1959, andLiu-Dengists in 1962 and 1964. It was this sharp and irreconcilable ideological splitbetween Maoists and Liu-Dengists that unfolded clearly from 1949 to the middle of1960s. I would like to argue here that this difference led to and made inevitable theoutbreak of the CR in1966.Obviously, there was a deep split over whether or not tocontinue and further the revolution, especially in the rural areas. For many CCPcadres, once the CCP had used revolutionary violence to seize power, the revolutioncame to an end, just like after a bus arrives at its final station, all passengers shouldget off. The only thing they wanted to do was to enjoy the fruits of their success, andto be rewarded byhonors and privileges that they felt they were entitled to.Thus themajor targets of struggle for Liu-Dengists lay outside the party. Within the party, therewas little chance that the Liu-Dengist power-holders would be the targets of struggle

187The veteran revolutionaries had all the rights to“lie on their records of merits tosleep" (which means enjoying life according to their past contributions). Indeed.Liu-Dengists once advocated their version of communism in the form of "wind ofcommunism" during the Great Leap Forward. Liu Shaoqi himself even brought KangYouwei's book, Datongshu: The One-World Philosophy, to bear on his experiments incommunism.Once their excessive practice of "communism”suffered debacles,theydid not take the lessons and reflect on their own mistakes. Instead, they forsook all theefforts to build socialism in a way that goes toward communism. They retreated to thecapitalist mode of production by trying to dissolve people's communes in agricultureand encouraged a policy of “economy and profits in command" in industry. The issuesof defending and advancing socialism, smashing the state machinery of thebourgeoisie and practicing the dictatorship of the proletariat, or the principle of theParis Commune, never really concerned Liu-Dengists. In sharp contrast, for theMaoists the principles of theParis Commune had always been a beacon for Chineserevolution.

The Paris Communein the“BourgeoisRights"(faquan)Debate:

TheoreticalDebutofZhangChunqiao

For Mao and his comrades, the revolution had just started. The generaldirection of China, without a doubt, should be communism. To achieve it, the crucialtask for real communists was not to consolidate the social order of New Democracy,

188but to fight against the capitalist tendency within and outside the CCP. What neededto be clarified was that in this further advance toward socialism, namely, the socialistrevolution,theCCP neededtosmash thestatemachine of thebourgeoisieinlight ofthe principles of the Paris Commune. In this process, the petti-bourgeoisie andnational bourgeoisie should become,unlike in the former stages of theNewDemocracy and the transitional period, the targets of the Socialist Revolution andconsequently subject to revolutionary criticism, even violence, if necessary. Andresistance both in practice and theory was unavoidable as changes here arefundamental and touch thevery core of society.

In order to retreat to and consolidate the"New Democratic social order",theLiu-Dengist line tended to justify and practice social hierarchy and correspondingbourgeois rights (faquan), which directly opposed the principles of the ParisCommune. For example, regardless of Mao's objection, they installed a system ofmilitary rank modeled upon the Soviet army. Mao himself firmly refused the title ofGeneralisimo and never touched the Grand Marshal's uniform made for him.Underthis ranking system, the gap between the highest wages of army officers and lowestpay for common soldiers was very wide. Even among officers, the highest wage was 6times of the lowest one. This difference among army officers was even wider than thatin the Hungarian army, in which the highest wage of an army officer was only 2.5times that of the lowest wage. (Upon receiving a Hungarian military delegation, Macpurposely praised the Hungarian army for this.)"? Similarly, a multi-level wage35 Wang Yan, Peng Dehuai nianpu (A Chronicle of Peng Dehuai's Life), Beijing: Renmin chubanshe, 1998, p.730.

189system was propagated throughout Chinese society. The Maoist theoreticiansferociously objected to this tendency. From 1958 to 1962, a heated theoretical debateover“bourgeois rights"among Chinese thinkers revealed complex issues whichforeshadowedsometrendsintheCR.GiventhefactoftheestablishmentofsocialistChina, opponents of the socialist revolution had to take up the strategy of waving “redflags" to oppose the red flag.*° In this context, the central issue that was vigorouslydebated from 1958 to 1962 was not whether bourgeois rights should be opposed, butwhat are bourgeois rights. By invoking the Paris Commune, Zhang Chunqiao, anactive participant of this debate and a major figure of the Shanghai Commune, made itclear in his theoretical debut“Eradicating BourgeoisRights"s7in1958thatitwashierarchy that lay at the core of the bourgeois system of rights.

QuotingMarx's statementin theCritiqueof theGothaProgramme that acommunist society ^in every respect, economically, morally, and intellectually, is stillstamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges,” Zhangagreed that a socialist society could not immediately resolve all the inequalityinherited in the bourgeois system of rights. Take the principle of distribution forexample,wecouldonlyfollowtheprinciple of"fromeachaccordingtohis ability,toeach according to his work" rather than “from each according to his ability, to eachaccording to his needs". But Zhang highlighted that Marx had no intention at all tosuggest that bourgeois rights and their innate hierarchy were justified and needed to36 Thiswas a poular practiceforthrghtists uring thRaswell andit istilte eenfor thecontmpraChineseregime.3ZhangChunqiaoPochuzichanjieji de faquan sixiang(Eradicating BourgeoisRights),inPeople'sDaily (RenminRibao),Oct.13,1958..

190be systemized and institutionalized. On the contrary, in order to criticize the trend ofpaying too much attention to “material benefits" and “material incentives” at that time,Zhang cited Marx's approval of theParis Commune in TheCivil War inFrance,“From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done atworkmen's wages. The vested interests and the representation allowances of the highdignitaries of State disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves."38 Zhanghence regarded the adoption by the Paris Commune of the revolutionary measures thatfocusedless onmaterial interests as part of the efforts to thoroughly demolish thehierarchical system of bourgeois rights. Zhang went even further to argue that therewas a need to strengthen communist education from political and ethical perspectivesso as to struggle for the complete eradication of bourgeois rights. In that regard, hefavored a free supply system (gongji zhi), where pay were handed out according toneeds rather than a hierarchical wage system. That is, Zhang Chunqiao basicallytreated the Paris Commune as a model with the communistic virtue of abolishinghierarchy and bourgeois rights. This viewforeshadowedwhat really took place in theCR, within which Zhang Chunqiao himself played a major part in trying to build anewcommune inShanghai.

In discussing whether or not to publish Zhang's article in the People's Daily.the chief-editor Wu Lengxi gathered many opposing opinions. Wu himself could notmake the decision and submitted the article to Mao. In a letter responding to WuLengxi, Mao praised Zhang's article as "basically correct", with the only shortcoming38 The English translation is from The Civil War in France, Foreign Languages Press, Beijing, 1964, p. 70,emphasisoriginal.

191being that it was“not so comprehensive forinterpreting the historical process ofbourgeois rights".39With this short article, Zhang became an important communisttheoretician. Mao's resolute support of Zhang Chunqiao during the CR could bepartially traced back his appreciation of Zhang's theoretical viewpoints in thisbourgeois rights debate.

Yet the following years saw a great deal of counter arguments toward Zhang'sarticle. Zheng Jiqiao, another famous theoretician and politician, for example, insistedthat the core of bourgeois rights was not the hierarchy because the bourgeoisconstitution stipulated that everybody was equal before the law and in the court.40Other theoreticianscontended that merevestiges of bourgeoisrights could not beequated with bourgeois rights in and of itself. And still others attempted to justify thewage system in the new China, stating that in the long socialist period beforecommunism, the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according tohis work" should be thoroughly carried out, etc..

Mao paid close attention this whole debate around bourgeois right.Whenreading Zheng Jiqiao's arguments, Mao wrote down a brief comment, saying thatbourgeois equality is “merely in form" (not in essence).4f Yet in the ensuing years,the multi-level-payment wage system was consolidated and institutionalized. AtMao's insistence though,the amount of the highest wage payment offered to the topleaders similar to him was greatly reduced in the 1960s. The popularity of these39MaoZedong,Introduction for Eadicating Bourgeois Rights, inPeople's Daily (Renmin ribao),Oct.11, 1958.40ZhengJqanEradicatingourgeoisRights Tantanxuehzichanjieifaquan)ineople'sDaily(Remnribao),0ct.18,1958.41Jianguo yilaiMaoZedongwengaoTheManuscripts of MaZedong SincetheFoundation of thePRC].Vol.7.Beijing:Zhongyangwenxian chubanshe,1988,p.483.

192counter arguments clearly reflected the mainstream viewpoint of the CCP, that is, afterwiping out the visible landlords and capitalists, how could so-called bourgeois rightsstill exist in a socialist society? Understandably, when Party leaders who once riskedtheir lives during the revolution to seize power began to enjoy privileges, the struggleto eradicate bourgeois rights was not easy. The continuous revolution was necessary atthis time, aimed at disguised and sometimes even stronger enemies. At its core wasthefight against revisionism as well as any retreat to the old society and hierarchy towhich everyonewas so accustomed.

It was this tense two-line struggle embodied not only in the conflicts onwhether or not to collectivize agriculture and industry but also manifested in thebourgeois rights debate, among other contradictions, that led to and underlay the CRThe launch of the CR signaled and embodied unprecedented social and culturalpractices of the theory of continuousrevolution.As theguideline of the CR—SixteenPoints(TheEleventhPlenum'sDecisionontheCulturalRevolution,8August,1966)put it, the CR represented “a more intense and extensive new stage of thedevelopment of socialist revolution", and was “a great revolution that deeply touchespeople to the very souls." Hence at the height of the CR in 1967, Yao Wenyuan, ChenBoda and their colleagues, as Mao's disciples and communist theoreticians, offered asuccinct summary of Mao's conceptualization of continuous revolution in six aspects:

One. It is necessary to apply the Marxist-Leninist law of theunity of opposites to the study of socialist society...

Two. “Socialist society covers a fairly long historical stage. Inthis stage, classes, class contradictions and class struggle continue, the

193strugglebetweenthesocialistroadandthecapitalistroadcontinuesand the danger of capitalist restoration remains."...In order to preventcapitalist restoration and“peaceful evolution,"it is imperative to carrythe socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts throughto theend.

Three. The class struggle under the dictatorship of theproletariat is in essence still a matter of political power...

Four. The struggle between the two classes and two roads insociety is inevitably reflected within theParty. ...

Five.It is of thegreatestimportancefor thecontinuation of therevolutionunder thedictatorshipof theproletariatthattheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolutionshouldbecarriedout.

Six.“Fight self, repudiate revisionism"is the fundamentalprogramme of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in theideological field. ... use proletarian ideology to overcome bourgeoisegoismandallnon-proletarianideas,transformeducation,literatureand art and all other parts of the superstructure that are not incorrespondence with the socialist economic base,and thus uprootrevisionism.42

From the above brief delineation, it was clear that Mao's thinking oncontinuous revolution took its shape from the actual practices of the Chineserevolution, that is,from struggles against various tendencies that risked abandoningrevolution and leading China astray from socialism.The key issue here was still "amatterofpoliticalpower".FortheMaoists'propositionthat"powercomesfrom thebarrel a gun,”" the Paris Commune served as a model for seizing power and abolishingthe old state apparatus.But apparently,armed force was just one of the aspects of howto defend proletarian power. There were still powers not coming from the barrel of agun. Maoists’ theory of continuous revolution hence addressed the difficult issues of42AdvanceAlongTheRoad OpenedUpByTheOctoberSocialistRevolution--InCommemorationof the5OthAnniversaryoftheGreatOctoberSocialistRevolution,bytheEditorialDepartmentsofPeople'sDaily(RenminRibao),Red Flag (Hongqi) and Liberation Daily (Jiefangjun Bao), in Peking Review,No.46,November 10,1967.

194defending,maintaining,and developing socialist societies after the proletariat was inpowerinaworldstilldominatedbycapitalism.In otherwords,socialistsocietiescould always be empowered by drawing on the spirits and fundamental dynamics thattheParis Commune highlighted.

In continuous revolution and long-term struggles, the Paris Commune, the firstexperiment of workers’ power with its accomplishments and lessons, is summoned upagain and again. As an unprecedented manifestation of the theory of continuousrevolution, the CR also invoked the Paris Commune as a model of abolishing the oldbourgeois-style state machine and establishing “a wholly new form of state structure"In this regard, the lessons of the Paris Commune greatly inspired Chinese Maoists andinfluenced the theory and practice of theCR

Smashing the Old and Establishing the New: Zheng Zhisi's

Interpretation of theParisCommune

Mao Zedong and other Maoist theoreticians had high expectations that “awholly new form of state structure”would emerge from the CR. They envisioned forthe CR many aspects of the long-expected“wholly new form of state structure"basedupon the principles of the Paris Commune on the eve of the CR and in its early stagesDelineating this“new form”with great details, the Maoist leadership and itstheoreticians gave priority to the masses'initiatives.For Mao, what mattered mostwerenotthevisionsandcommandsofleaders,butthebroadmasses'voicesand

195creativity. That is,no matter how delicate a political roadmap and design was,theblueprint would be of little use if the political and class consciousness of the mass wasnot mature and their fighting spirit was not high. Mao said that “On a blank sheet ofpaper free from any mark, the freshest and most beautiful pictures can be painted."However the painters and artists here by no means represented the leaders alone. “Theoutstanding thing about China's 600 million people is that they are ^poor and blank.This may seem a bad thing, but in reality it is a good thing. Poverty gives rise to thedesire for change, the desire for action and the desire for revolution.43 What Maowas emphasizing here was the masses’initiatives. In order to create a beautiful workof art, the masses and the leaders have to work together closely. The mass was alsothe decisive driving force in advancing history according to Mao. He encouraged themasses to go through self-education and self-liberation by actively participating in themovements, or to use a metaphor that he cherished very much, to learn swimmingfrom swimming", especially “swimming in great winds and waves." Through therevolutionary process, the Maoists leadership hoped that various“new socialistthings" would be created by the masses with acute political consciousness, and inparticular,akindof“whollynewform ofstatestructure”modeled aftertheParisCommunewould enter onto thehistoricalstage

However, the vision of Mao and some major other Maoist theoreticians abouttheParis Communeineffect oriented themasses’thoughts andimaginations about a"wholly new form of state structure” to a great extent. On the eve of the CR, a key43 Mao Zedong,"Introducing a Co-operative" (April 15, 1958),from Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung, p.36.Beijing:PekingForeignLanguagesPress,1966.

196articleentitled"TheGreatLessonsoftheParisCommune-inCommemorationofIts95th Anniversary” appeared as an editorial on the CCP theoretical organ Red Flag(Hongqi Magazine) on March 26, 1966,44 indicating that some early signs and trendsof the historical movement loomed on the horizon. Similar to some other importantdocuments released during the CR, the author Zheng Zhisi (Cheng Chih-Sze) was justa pennamewhich could notbe traced to a single person in anyWho'sWhodictionaryabout modern China. It might be a pseudonym of Chen Boda, the chief-editor of RedFlag in1966,whowas a major advocate and theoretician of the people's commune inthe rural areas (and some urban commune experiments as well) during the Great LeapForward. In this editorial, Zheng began with a general comment that “The greatChinese revolution, victorious under the guidance of Mao Zedong (Tse-tung)'sthought, has inherited and further developed the experience of the Paris Communeand the experience of the October Revolution." It was known that the official launchdate of the CR was May 16th, 1966.Before that, the PRC state structure mainlyfollowed that of its counterpart in the UsSR, and there were no major state structuralchanges modeled upon the Paris Commune. Why then did Zheng Zhisi argue that theChineserevolutioninherited andextended theexperience of theParis Commune andthat the CCP was “struggling resolutely against all renegades who have turned theirbacks on the principle of the Paris Commune"? 45

According to “The Great Lessons of the Paris Commune", the mostfundamental principle of the Paris Commune was“the use of revolutionary violence44 Its English ranslation can be found in Peking Review, Nos. 14-16, April 1, April 8, and April 15, 196.45Ibid.

197toseizepower,smashthestatemachine of thebourgeoisie andpractice thedictatorship of the proletariat."Furthermore,reflecting thelessons of theParisCommune, Zheng emphasized the pertinence of the principle in China especially aftertherevolution:

It is out of the question for the leaders of any proletariat party not inpower tolead a revolution,if they turn their back on theprinciple ofthe Commune. What is more, such leaders will become renegades andstool-pigeons. If such leaders discard the principle of the Communeafter theyhave assumed power, there exists the danger of thepeople'srevolutionlosingitsfruits and theseleaders themselveswilllikewisebecome outright renegades and stool-pigeons, and flunkeys andaccomplicesoftheimperialists

In this regard, the principle of the Paris Commune was of great importance intwo stages: before and after the proletariat was in power. It was not only about how toseize power from below,but also about how to defend power and safeguard the fruitsof revolution. Practicing and maintaining this principle thus necessitated long-termand continuous revolution that could be grouped into stages characterized by differenttasks,differentenemies and differentmanifestations.Had the CCPbeforethe CRfollowed and further developed this principle? The answer would be both YES andNO with the tense two-line struggle within the CCP in mind. It was a No because theLiu-Dengists'Sovietization andbureaucratization of theChinesestatestructurecounteractedtheenthusiasmandinitiativesofthebroadmasses;itwasaYesbecausethe Maoists’efforts in following the mass line and valorizing renewed revolutionaryspirits based on the dictatorshipof theproletariat emancipated the productivity and

198transformed the corresponding superstructure.*oObviously, because of Mao Zedong'sthinking on and practice of the continuous revolution, Zheng Zhisi was able to statethat the Chinese revolution had inherited and further developed the experiences of theParisCommuneandtheOctoberRevolution

Why was theParis Commune still relevant and worthy of commemoration inthe 1960s in the 20th century? Zheng quoted Engels, “The Commune was the grave ofthe old, specifically French socialism, but at the same time it was the cradle of theinternational communism that was new to France."47 The old socialism, inferred fromZheng's quotations of Marx and Engels, was the petti-bourgeois socialism that hadflourished in the middle of the 19"h century France, especially in the form ofProudhonism and Blanquism which were strongly represented in the Paris Commune.Nevertheless,thetruesecret of the Communewas,according toMarx,that"itwasessentially a working-class government, the product of the struggle of the producingagainst the appropriatingclass,thepoliticalform atlast discovered underwhich towork out the economic emancipation of labor."*48 The Commune was not run in anysense by given"principles"of Proudhonism and Blanquism,but merely by simple andpractical needs.All the economic measures the Commune adopted,therefore,weredriven “not at all in accordance with the spirit of Proudhonism, but certainly in46 This has always been the direction of Mao's efforts.Engels,"Letter to August Bebel, Oct. 29, 1884," Collected Works of Marx and Engels, Russian ed., State Publishing House ofPoliticalLiterature,Moscow,1964,Vol.xxxVI,p.196.Quoted from Cheng Chih-Szu,The Great Lessons ofThe ParisCommune--InCommemoration ofIts95thAnniversary,inPekingReview,No.15,April8,1966.48Marx,"The Civil War in France,"Selected Works of Marx and Engels,Vol. I, p. 522.

199accordance with the spirit of German scientific socialism,49 which was based on ascientific analysis of economic conditions and means of production,and based on ascientificinterpretation and transformation of thepracticalneeds of theproletariatFrom the Paris Commune onward,international communism,rooted in the Germanscientific socialist tradition, quickly grew up from its cradle and gained greaterstrength day by day. Breaking through the bonds of Proudhonism and Blanquism-typepetty bourgeois socialism that dominated the Second International, and distorted theMarxian legacy of German scientific socialism, and following the masses’will, Lenin,at last, blazed a new trail along the road opened up by the Paris Commune. ACommune-type Soviet was created upon the establishment of a working people'sstate—the USSR. Quoting for authority Engels' comments on the internationalmeaning of the Paris Commune, Zheng explained its renewed pertinence in the springof 1966.Even though Zheng's editorial mainly tackled the history of theParisCommune, it was intended to address also the context of contemporary national andinternational reality.“Smashing the military-bureaucratic machine of the bourgeoisieand establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat to replace the dictatorship of thebourgeoisie—this is the quintessence of Marxist-Leninist theory on the state and themost important experience of the Paris Commune." Invoking the model of the ParisCommune, Zheng advocated burying the old, specifically the actually existingbureaucratized and degraded USSR socialism since “the Khrushchov [Krushchev]revisionists, under the pretext that times have changed, publicize the deceitful myth491Engels,"The Housing Question," Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. I, p. 612,quoted from ChengChih-Szu,The Great Lessons of TheParis Commune -In Commemoration of its 95th Anniversary,in PekingReview,No.15,April8,1966.

200thattheproletariatcanseizestatepowerwithoutsmashingthestatemachineofthebourgeoisie and that socialism canbe built without the dictatorship of theproletariat.'5o The article also expressed the discontent toward the Chinese statemachinery in previous years to some extent, when it more or less showed therepressive characteristics of theSovietstate apparatus toward the masses afterStalin

'The political instrument of their enslavement cannot serve as the politicalinstrument of their emancipation."51 Following this vein, Zheng's article on the ParisCommune stressed the necessity of smashing the bourgeois state machine withrevolutionaryviolence and thedictatorshipofproletariat.TheParisCommunewasnot just "a product of a ballot by the whole people and of ^pure democracy""(asKautsky claimed); it was more a product of blood and fire, a product of revolutionaryviolence, which surely resonated in the historical practices of the CR.

The purpose of going over the experience and lessons of the Paris Commune,according to a Red Flag("Hongqi") editor's note of "The Great Lessons of The ParisCommune—-In Commemoration of Its 95th Anniversary", was to wage a struggleagainst Khrushchevian revisionism and carry forward the world revolution.WhenZheng Zhisi published his article in1966,one major target of his criticism,Khrushchev himself, had already been dismissed from his position as the partysecretary of the CPSU twoyears before.But the CCP believed that the USSR stillcarried out aKhrushchevian revisionist line withoutKhrushchevhimself.Therefore tocondemn Khrushchevian revisionism in an editorial commemorating theParis53 Peking Review, No. 16, April 15, 1966, p.23.54 I summarize the sixfeatures from Zhang Zhisi's editorialThe Great Lessons of the Paris Commune -InCommemoration of Its 95th Anniversary,inPekingReview,No.15,April 8,1966.

202Commune was still “of vital and practical significance."S5 In fact, the CCP's struggleagainst Khrushchevian revisionism could be traced back to1956, when Khrushchevput forward his "parliamentary road" and “three-peace"at the 2Oth Congress of theCPSU, i.e. peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with capitalist states, andpeaceful transition of capitalist societies. Directly targeting these slogans, the CCPpublicized an important article “More on the Historical Experience of the Dictatorshipof the Proletariat" in 1956 to reaffirm the road of the October Revolution, i.e. violentrevolution as a universal law of proletarian revolution. At the 22nd Congress of theCPSU in 1961, Khrushchev proclaimed the Soviet Union and the CPSU as the state ofthe entire people and the party of the entire people, in opposition to the state of theproletariat and the party of the proletariat insisted on by the CCP. Khrushchev's viewwas totally inconsistent with the CCP's ideology at the time.From 1956 to1966,theCCP produced a series of theoretical articles to criticize Khrushchev's positionamong which the most important nine treatises were referred to as"ninecommentaries". Zheng Zhisi's article on the Paris Commune, as mentioned above,waspartofthiseffort.

Nevertheless, with the CR approaching, the problems tackled in Zheng'streatise could not be irrelevant to the reality in China at the time. The denunciation ofKhrushchev was in fact also targeting Khrushchev-style cadres in China as well.Khrushchev's viewpoints did command a great deal of sympathy among someChinese high ranking officials. As discussed above, many civilian and military high55 Ibid.

203ranking cadres in China,like Khrushchev, actually disliked the people's commune andwere content with profit-driven industry policies. With regard to international affairs,the corresponding slogan of Khrushchev's “three-peace”in China was summarized as"three reconciliations [with imperialists, reactionaries and modern revisionists offoreign countries.] and one reduction [of support and assistance to the liberationstruggles of other peoples.]" ("san he yi shao"), which was first advocated by WangJiaxiang. One of the senior leaders of the CCP in its early stage,Wang was the viceminister of ForeignAffairs after 1949 and the director of the CCP CentralCommittee's International Liaison Department after 1951. However, Wang Jiaxiang'sview was by no means limited to himself. Most major CCP leaders, such as LiuShaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Peng Zhen, Wu Xiuquan, Liu Ningyi, and Wang Li, endorsedthis policy.56 When Liu Shaoqi was brought down during the CR as the “ChineseKhrushchev" and the “No. one capitalist roader” in the party, the policy of “san zi yibao"(threeselfs and one contract)was seen as his restorationist programfor nationalaffairs,and the“san he yi shao"was characterized as his international program

When Liu-Dengists employed materialincentives in the economic realms, Mao and Lin Biao called for putting politics in56Wang Li, Xianchang Lishi —Wenhua Da Geming Jishi (History Witnessed——Reminiscence of the CulturalRevolution),pp.20-22,HongKong:OxfordUniversity,1993.

204command.WhenPengDehuai andothergeneralsweredevotedtotheformalizationand modernization of the army,Mao and LinBiao energetically advocated developingthe people's militia, abolishing the military rank system, and reaffirming theapplication of people's war.When other leaders believed that the party could manageeverything, Maoist cadres encouraged the masses to supervise the party andparticipate in management, while the cadres should participate in productive labor. Allof these efforts were in sharp contrast to Khrushchev and the practices of his Chinesefollowers. As the Liu-Dengists acquired more and more state power, the two-linestruggle was increasingly intensified. As a result, Maoists’ achievements in abolishingor limiting bourgeois rights were far from satisfactory on the eve of the CR. Thatmight be an important concern for Zheng Zhisi to reiterate these principles in thistreatise.

According to Maoist theoreticians such as Zheng Zhisi, a new commune-typestate power created by the masses along Mao's line would not only be the grave ofUSSR-style bureaucratism (and of, to some extent, Chinese bureaucratism), but alsobe of great significance for international communism. It would uphold the theoriesand practices of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and repulse those of Khrushchev's‘peaceful transition" and “the state of the whole people." Indeed, theories andpractices of the CR and the Chinese experiments with the Commune style organswerereverberated across theworld in the sixties and seventies in the 2o" century.

205Mass Movement and “The Declaration of the Chinese Paris

Commune"

In effect, Mao was quite clear about the great significance as well as the greatdifficulties of making fundamental changes in revolution, i.e., making revolutionwithin revolution.In a talk addressed to chief leaders in the Central Committee in July1966, Mao highlighted the importance of the CR which came at a critical juncture inthe building of socialism: “The current Great Cultural Revolution is an earthshakingevent. Can we or do we dare undergo the test of socialism? This aims in the finalanalysis to wipe out classes and reduce the three great differences."57 In other wordsin preventing the possible emergence of a new privileged class and gradually reducingall the inequalities inheritedfrom the oldsociety,theCR represented a crucialwatershed in continuous revolution that would keep China on the socialist andcommunistroad.

Roughly two months after Zheng Zhisi's article in commemoration of theParis Commune, some young instructors and staff members, including Nie Yuanzi inthe Department of Philosophy in Beijing University put up a famous big-characterposter entitled "What are Song Shuo, Lu Ping, and Peng Peiyun up to in the CulturalRevolution?onMay25,1966.Theposter waslater referred to as thefirst57Mao supports theRedGuards,21July,1966,inThePeople'sRepublic of China:1949-1979,ADocumentarySurvey,Vol.3,p.1552,ed.Harold C.Hinton,Wilmington,Del: Scholarly Resources Inc.,1980.“Three greatdifferences”(san dachabie)refer tothefact that there exists in socialist countries the differencebetweenmanualand mental laborers,between the city and the country, and between peasant and worker.The communists aim toeliminatethesethreemajordisparities.

At present, the people of the whole nation, in a soaringrevolutionary spirit which manifests their boundless love for the Partyand ChairmanMao and their inveteratehatredfor the sinister anti-Party,antisocialist gang, are making a vigorous and great cultural revolution;they are struggling to thoroughly smash the attacks of the reactionarysinister gang, in defense of the Party's Central Committee andChairman Mao.But here in Beijing University the masses are beingkept immobilized, the atmosphere is one of indifference and deadness,whereas the strong revolutionary desire of the vast number of thefaculty members and students has been suppressed. What is the matter?What is the reason? There is something fishy going on. Let us take alook atwhathas happenedveryrecently!

It took place after the publication on May 8 of the articles byHe Ming and Kao Chu [Gao Ju] and the upsurge in the nationwidestruggle to denounce the “Three-Family Village." On May 14, Lu Ping[President of Beijing University and Secretary of its Party Committee]hastily transmitted the “directive”issued by Sung Shih [Song Shuo, thedeputyhead of thedepartmentin chargeof university affairsunder theBeijing Municipal Party Committee] at an emergency meeting of thedepartment. Sung Shih [Song Shuo] said that at present the movementbadly needs a strengthened leadership and the Party organizations inthe colleges are required to strengthen the leadership and stand fast atthe posts....Big meetings can in noway serve to completely discreditthe anti-Party, antisocialist remarks and theoretically repudiate them. ..In case the angry masses demand that a big meeting be held, do notsuppress them but guide them to hold small group meetings, studydocumentsandwritesmall-characterposters.

Lu Ping and Peng Pei-yun [a cadre in the department in chargeof university affairs under the Beijing Municipal Party Committee andDeputy Secretary of theBeijing UniversityParty Committee]

conducted the movement in Beijing University entirely in the same58 See Peking Review, No. 37, September 9, 1966.

207vein.They said,

... It is not suitable for Beijing University to stick upbig-character posters... . Big-character posters must not beencouraged; if the masses want to post them, actively guide themaway.

Is this the linefor the Cultural Revolution laid down by theParty's Central CommitteeandChairmanMao?No,absolutelynot!Itis an out-and-out revisionist line that runs counter to the Party'sCentral Committee and to Mao Zedong's thought

"This is an ideological struggle.“The anti-Party, antisocialistremarks have to be completely repudiated theoretically.""Persist inreasoning." This struggle “must be conducted in a very carefulmanner."What does all this mean?Can it be considered a theoreticalproblem? Is it all just remarks? Whither do you want to "guide" thelife-and-death political struggle we are waging to counterattack thesinister anti-Party, antisocialist gang?Isn't it one of the main tactics ofDeng Tuo and his instigators in resisting the Cultural Revolution todivert this serious political struggle to“purely academic" discussions?Why are you still doing things this way up to this moment? What kindof people areyou actually?

"The masses, when they arise, need to be led onto the correctpath.""Guide themovement towarda correct orientationinitsdevelopment." "Only by energetically assuming the leadership can [themovement] beled toits normal development.""Whatis meant by"correct path"? What is meant by “correct orientation'?What is meantby “normal development"?You have“guided" the great political classstruggle into a “purely theoretical" and “purely academic"trap. Notlong ago, was it not you who personally “guided’ the comrades of thelawfaculty toconsultfifteenhundredvolumes ofbooks andmaterialrunning tofourteen million characters to study the question concerningthe “reversal of wrong verdicts" by Hai Rui? Was it not you who havegiven great publicity to this as “correct orientation and the rightmethod,” asking everybody to learn from this "good experience"? Inactualfact,thisis“good experience”whichhas allbeencreatedbyyou

208andDeng Tuo and his sinister gang:and this is also thevery essence ofyour talk that “the movement is healthy." The Party's CentralCommitteeandChairmanMaohavelongsinceshownusthecorrectpath for the Cultural Revolution and its correct orientation. You saynothing about them and work out your own so-called “correct path"and “correct orientation"in the hope of drawing the revolutionary massmovement into your revisionist orbit.Frankly speaking, this is a vainhope!

"Big meetings can in no way serve to theoretically repudiatethem."“It is not suitable for Beida [Beijing University] to stick upbig-character posters,”" we “must guide them to hold small groupmeetings and write small-character posters."Why are you so afraid ofbig-character posters and the holding of big denunciation meetings? Tocounterattack the sinister gang whichhas frantically attacked theParty,socialism, and Mao Zedong's thought is a life-and-death class struggle.The revolutionary people must be fully aroused to vigorously andangrily denounce them, and to hold big meetings and put upbig-character posters, is one of the best ways for the masses to dobattle. By “guiding” the masses not to hold big meetings, not to put upbig-character posters, and by creating all kinds of taboos, aren't yousuppressing the masses'revolution,not allowing them to makerevolution,and opposing theirrevolution?Wewill neverpermityou todo this!...59

Even though this big-character poster by Nie and her colleagues itself did notmention the Paris Commune,Maohailed it as“the declaration of the Chinese Pariscommune ofthesixties of thetwentieth century.ItssignificancesurpassestheParisCommune. It is beyond us to write this kind of big-character poster.*60 Why did Maospeaksohighlyofit,andwhydidMaoclaimthatheandhiscomradescouldnotcomposeit?

The reasons,I argue,lie in the different attitudes toward the idea of continuous59 Nieh Yuan-tzu and Others, What Are Sung Shih,Lu Ping, and Peng Pei-yun Up To in the Culural Revolution?modifiedfromPekingReview,No.37,September 7,1966.60Mao supports theRedGuards,21July1966inThePeople'sRepublic ofChina:1949-1979,ADocumentarySurvey,Vol.3,p.1552,ed.Harold C.Hinton,Scholarly Resources Inc.Wilmington,Delaware.

Achieving victory and obtaininghighpositions,the oncerevolutionaries would not onlydistance themselvesfrom themasses,but alsoincline tomaintain thestatus quo,andtheycouldnotrealize thenecessity andimportance of continuous revolutionwithout newrevolutionarystimulations. On the contrary, the masses, including low ranking officials, tend to feelthe repression and injustice of the new hierarchical power structure. They were proneto the idea of continuous revolution and cried for changes. This might be the veryhotbed of all kinds of social movements. The CR, without exception, found a largenumber of its supporters among the broad masses. In this sense, the CR was far from arevolution from above, as some scholars claim today or as described in David Kotz'snarrative of the collapse of USSR.° It was more a revolution from below, eventhough it was led by the active direction and strong support from the Maoists in theCCP leadership. I will elaborate on this point in the next chapter on the rise ofShanghaiCommune.

210independent China.The Paris Commune (like most other revolutions)was triggeredby accumulated sufferings and miseries that the people could bear no longer, so thatrebellion was their only choice. Centering on the practice of mass movements and theidea of continuous revolution, Mao's CR by contrast, aimed to tackle the difficultissue of the alienation of power in post-revolutionary societies in order to maintain thedynamics of a permanent revolutionary process. As argued above, almost withoutexception,veteran revolutionaries tend to become non-revolutionary oranti-revolutionary oncepower hasbeenseized.Theyrapidlydegenerateintotheopposite of what they stand for. In this sense, the CR that Mao promoted was anunprecedented and spectacular, though hard, endeavor that attempted to re-activatethe revolutionary potential and vibrancy in a post-revolutionary society. Comparedwith previous revolutions, Mao's continuous revolution nearly set up an impossiblemission.

After the launch of the CR, the group of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping triedtolimit thepolitical and ideological struggles triggered byYaoWenyuan's A CritiqueoftheNewHistoricalPlay,HaiRui'sDismissalfromOfficetotheso-calledacademicdiscussions, which were in fact meant to defuse the CR. By emphasizing “reinforcingthe leadership and sticking to one's post,"the administration of Beijing Universitytried to suppress all oppositions expressed in posters written by revolutionary facultiesand students. It refused not only to be subjected to the supervision of public opinionsbut also to take responsibility for mistakes, even crimes, under their leadershipOpposition to mass movements and the CR, to a great extent, was rooted deeply in the

211political instinct of the bureaucracy. The poster by Nie Yuanzi, in this regard, pointedout incisively that power holders attempted to softenfiercepolitical class strugglesand limit them to “pure theory" and “pure academics." Replacing politics with “pureacademics", as Wang Hui suggested, was no more than a political action offde-politicization,°? which manifested itself as a reaction that rejected theories andpractices of the continuousrevolution in the CR

The big-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and her colleagues frightened theLiu-Dengists, as it clarified the nature of the CR as being political, rather than merely“cultural" or “academic", and that the CR necessitated political participation of themasses rather than party bosses'issuing directives and giving commands. Four daysafter Nie Yuanzi's wall poster, the top leaders in Beijing, including Liu Shaoqi, ZhouEnlai and Deng Xiaoping, hastily decided to send in work teams to Beijing Universityand other places on May 29, 1966. What was Mao's view of their decision? Mao, whowas on a trip away from Beijing, agreed by phone to the idea of sending work teams.which was a long-standing CCP political tradition to mobilize the masses. But a vitaldifference between Mao and other major leaders existed in terms of how they viewedtherole ofwork teams.ForMao,workteamswerejust tools forhelpingthemasses tocarry out revolution. If work teams hindered revolution, they should be disbandedwithout hesitation. After returning to Beijing from Southern China, Mao found thatmost work teams erred in their political line by not assisting and fostering the massmovement.In an evaluation of work teams,he said:63 See Wang, Hui, Qu zhengzhi hua de zhengzhi (The Politics of De-Politicization), Beijing: Sanlian shudian,2008.

212[Generallyspeaking,]Workteamshinderedrevolution.Yetthere arestillworkteamsthat did nothinderrevolution.If hinderingrevolutionthe work teams will surely become reactionary. Take Xi'anCommunicationUniversityfor example,work teams thereforbadepeople to call, to send representatives to the Center [in Beijing]. Whyare they so scared of people's going to the Center? Let them [go and]surround the state council.It should be allowed in governmentaldocuments for people to call the Center and send representatives [toBeijing]...64

Obviously for Mao, the sending of work teams was not the essential issue.What mattered was whether work teams helped the masses to make revolution or not.According to his observation, nearly 90 percent of work teams in the CR neitherstruggled against capitalist roaders, nor reformed unreasonable things;D.andhebelived that for Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, the purpose of sending work teamswas to suppress revolution and oppose the masses.°6 With this judgment Mao orderedthewithdrawalof almost alltheworkteams thathadbeensentoutunder theordersofLiu andDeng.But thereweresome work teams that received praises byMaofor theinpromotion of revolution at their stationed work-units (danwei), e.g., the work teamsent to the People's Daily and led by ChenBoda, the director of CCRG. But for LiuShaoqi and Deng Xiaoping, the dispatch of work teams was intended to suppress thespreading wild fire of political dissension among the masses targeted power-holdersenergetically persecuting political dissenters. As Liu Shaoqi admitted in aself-criticismin October1966,64Mao,Speechat aMeetingofCCPSecretaries of Large Regions and CCRG Members(zai huijian daqu shujihezhongyang wenge xiaozu chengyuan de jianghua),July 22,1966.from LongLive MaoZedong Thought(MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5, p.280, printed in Wuhan, 1967-1968.65 Ibid.66Ibid.

213The rebel spirit of the proletarian class must be advocated.

I regarded the normal andinevitabledefectsofthemassmovementsasthereverseupsurgeofanti-party, anti-socialist, and anti-proletarian dictatorship trends...67

Work teams that were sent out and instructed by Liu-Dengists considered thecurrent mass movement merely a new version of the 1957 Anti-Rightist Campaign,during which hundreds of thousands intellectuals were labeled as“rightists", many ofthem just raising criticisms toward their direct party secretaries. Through his daughterLiu Pingping, Liu Shaoqi personally gave instructions to the work team that was sentout to the No.1 Middle School attached to Beijing Normal University, where hisdaughter studied. Liu Shaoqi said that in the range of the country, the enemies to betargeted should at least be 5 percent. But according to his daughter's report of herschool LiuShaoqisaid thatenemiesinthisschoolcouldbefarmorethanthebaselineof 5 percent. Consequently, more than 90 percent of cadres in this school were labeledas“ghosts and monsters"and"blackgangsters".77percent of class advisers werestruggled with.

214middle school attended byhis daughter Deng Rong.DengXiaoping set the targets ofstruggle at this school as ordinary students and teachers,even instructing people tostruggle against theparents of targeted students."Consequently, in the first fifty-odddays after theworkteams weresent out,therewerewaves of"white terror"(Mao'sdescription) wildly striking the whole country. Work teams recklessly imposed controlof the mass movement. Outspoken people were accused and labeled by work teams as“rightists", “bogus leftists/true rightists" and even “counterrevolutionaries". Manyactivists were in this way jailed or even compelled to commit suicide. According tostatistics, in the first two months of the CR during “white terror",10,211 studentswere designated as "rightists"and 2591 teachers were designated as"counterrevolutionaries" by work teams at just 24 universities in Beijing (there aremany more universities in Beijing) under the instructions of Liu Shaoqi and DengXiaoping70

This kind of political persecution was by no means just limited to Beijing.Take Wuhan for example. The earliest work team in the country—the EducationalRevolution Group of Wuhan University, was set up in Wuhan, Hubei Province onApril 18, 1966, one month before the official launch of the CR. At the time, WangRenzhong, the first party secretary of Hubei Party Committee and the director of69 Deng Rong: Dui Deng Xiaoping de jiefa (Disclosing Deng Xiaoping),in Chedi qingsuan Deng Xiaoping zaiwuchanjiejiwenhuadagemingzhongdetaotianzuixing(ThoroughlyLiquidateDengXiaoping'sMonstrousCrime In The GPCR),ed.by the 02621 Corps of NewBeijingUniversity Commune (xin beida gongshe),April1967. In Deng Rong's girls school, the vice-president Bian Zhongyun was the first teacher in the whole countrybeaten to death—this occurred on August 5,1966 and was done by the Red Guards consisting mainly of childrenof high Party cadres.(There are also sources that attribute Bian's death to some adults who did not get along withBina,not Red Guards).At the time,the work team already left the girls school upon Mao's order,but the workteam formed a“Representative Committee of Revolutionary Teachers and Students" to take control of the school.70XiaoXidong TheFiftyDays in1966:ThePolitics of Memory and Oblivion(1966niande50 tian: jiyi yuyiwang de zhengzhi), http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=17265, cited 28 March, 2009.

215Hubei CR,claimed that theCRwould benomore than a“Four CleansMovement”between 1962 and 1966 plus a “Anti-Rightist Movement of 1957” and that the targetsof this struggle should be intellectuals.7T Therefore, the work team leader sent toWuhan University asserted that the CR would be a higher stage of the Anti-RightistMovement.In linewith this,the work team and its successor, the CR Committee ofWuhan University, branded 232 teachers and staff members as "black gangs*(heibang) and being part of the “black line"(heixian) within just four months. Thisrepresented 19% of the total 1,242 personnel on campus. 108 cadres ranking higherthan the vice-secretaries of the Party branches and the deputy directors of teachingand research sections were relegated to “black gangs", which accounted for 38.2 % ofall cadres in the university. In the Chinese Department, 36 out of 63 staff, 18 out of 19senior cadres and all5secretaries of thepartybrancheswerelabeledas“blackgangsandbeinginthe“blackline".Among therest of thepersonnelinthe departmentmany were reprimanded, forced to make self-criticism, dismissed from importantpositions or even were put under supervision and house arrest. In the university, morethan 150 persons were deprived of voting rights and the right to be elected. The workteam forced the targets of criticism and struggle to study Liu Shaoqi's How to be aGood Communist(lungongchandangyuan dexiuyang),but refused them access tomost Mao's works. In addition, even though the CCP central committee issued acircular in forbidding the local authorities from reducing the wages of those being7Thoroughly Criticizing theBourgeoisReactionary Line ofWang Renzhong'sWork TeamontheIsue of WuhanUniversity's Cadres(Chedi pipanWangRenzhonggongzuozuzaiWuhan daxueganbuwenti shang dezichan jiejifandong luxian),in East Is Red(dongfang hong),ed.by The Third Headquarters of Red Guards in Wuhan Region.May11,1967.

The work team there quicklydesignated these young people as “counterrevolutionaries". All the major activists inthis high school were put in jail. Some of them were even sentenced to the deathpenalty, and the three youngest students aged 16were sentenced to3 or 5 yearsimprisonment.73

In Lanzhou, the capital city of the western province of Gansu, under anatmosphere of ruthless struggles and mercilessblows (canku douzhengwuqing daji),Zhang Chaoren, a student of Lanzhou University, was driven to suicide by throwinghimself at a moving train. A female student Kuang X X jumped from a buildingresulting in disabling injuries. Zhang Haiyan, a student in the Chinese department.was almost beaten to death. The scope of attacks in Lanzhou University accounted for32.3% of the total 5,000 or so personnel on the whole campus.74 In Xi'anCommunicationUniversity of Shanxi Province,more than300 cadres weredispatched to take control of the campus movement by the Shanxi Provincial Party72Ibid.73WangRenhongCreofSuppressinMassMovement:AReportofailingtheRevolutionaryTeachersndStudentsinWuhanMoshuihuHighSchool(WangRenzhongzhenyaqunzhongyundongdezuixing:WuhanMoshuihu zhongxue geming shisheng ruyu jishi), in the Battle News of Criticizing Tao Zhu (pi tao zhanbao),March14,196774LuYanfu,Tell thePeople theHistoricalTruth:TheMoreThanFiftyDays'WhiteTerrorinLanzhouUniversityat theEarlyStageoftheCR(Balishizhenxianggaosurenmin:wengechuqi lanzhoudaxuedewushiduotianbaise kongbu), see http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=6449, cited on September 25, 2009.

Under the ruthless suppressions of the powerful work team, 4 peoplecommitted suicide,and two of them died.The deceased werecharged as“suicidewithcrimes"(weizui zisha) and hence branded by the work team as"counterrevolutionaries".75

Similar cases happened everyday in the entire country in thework-team-dominated period. Due to work teams’ruthless persecution, cases ofsuicide were reported everywhere. Even though the post-CR regime never disclosedthe statistics, the death toll caused by work team under the instruction of Liu-Dengistscould be counted in tens of thousands. The persecution naturally widened the distanceand caused grave tension between work teams and their targets,which unsurprisinglyaroused people's revolutionary ire toward work teams and their ^behind-the-scenesbosses"in the top leadership of the CCP. Mao was so outraged by this suppressionthat he wrote a famousbig-character poster to condemn the work teams and theirinstructorsfromtheCentertothelocalauthorities.Itread

How poisonous!Viewed in connection with the Right deviation in 1962 and the wrongtendency of 1964 which was ^Left' in form but Right in essence,shouldn't this make one wide awake?76

By terming the work team stage as “white terror", Mao differentiated himselffromLiu-Dengistsontheissueofhowtorun theCR.ForMao,toactivelysupport themassmovement onitsowninitiativeswastoservetheinterests ofproletariat.In anopposite way,Liu-Dengists'plan of running the CR never included extensivemobilizationofthebroadestmasses.EventhoughitwashardforthePartybureaucrats to control the situation singlehandedly, the Liu-Dengists would mobilizesome loyalist masses to fight against rebel masses. Paradoxically, the Liu-Dengistsvigorous suppression of the mass movement actually demonstrated that thebig-character poster by Nie Yuanzi and others was necessary, very much in line withMao's idea of mass movements and the conceptualization of continuous revolution.The suppression of the mass movement by Liu-Dengists precisely confirmed thebelief by the Maoist leadership that capitalist roaders did in fact exist within the partyThe protests of Nie Yuanzi and her colleagues, the masses’ desire to participate in themovementswerevivid manifestations of the peoples'power tofight against therevisionist lineinthepartyin theeyes of theMaoistleadership.That iswhyMaoZedong highly praised NieYuanzi and her fellow rebels. When talking to twocommunist theoreticians Chen Boda and Ai Siqi in Dec. 1965, Mao once argued:76 Mao Zedong, Bombard the Bourgeois Headquarters-My Big-Character Poste, in Peking Review, No.33,August11,1967

219Political work must follow mass line. It will not work to merelydepend on leaders. How can you handle so many things?You can notsee a lot of things. You can only see some things. Therefore, it isnecessary tomobilize everybody to take responsibility. Let everybodyspeak, agitate and criticize. Everyone has eyes and mouths. Let themsee and speak.Letthemasses takecare of their own affairs.Thisisdemocracy. Here are two lines: one is to depend on individual leaders,another is to mobilize the masses to take care of things. Our politics isdemocratic politics of the masses. The masses, instead of a few peopleshould rule.It is a must tomobilizeeverybody tospeak.Sinceeverybodyhas a mouth,heshould taketworesponsibilities:oneis toeatwhileanotheristospeak.Inthefaceofbadthings andbadstyles[of work], he should speak and shoulder the fighting responsibility.Without the Party's leadership, or merely depending on individualleaders, surely we can not do things well. We must depend on the Partyand all the comrades, rather than individual leaders, to handle things.We need to mobilize the masses. It is necessary to foster an atmosphereunderwhich themasseshold responsibility and speak.For the above,depend on the Party's leadership; for the below, depend on the broadestmasses. Only in this way could things be well done.77

Obviously, Mao believed in the superiority of democratic politics of themasses,and regarded themobilization of themasses under theleadership of thePartyas the best way to realize democratic politics. As he clarified, “I'm not Mao Zedongagain if I do not promote mass movements." The mass movement is necessary in allwork. Things won't go without the mass movement.78 For him, in face of thedeepening bureaucratization of the Chinese state apparatus up to1966,only greatmass movements, such as the CR, could keep the Chinese revolution afloatdynamically.And the veteran revolutionaries could make new contributions for thepeople. Similarly, a party was hardly a communist party any more if it did not support7MaoZedong,TalktoChenBoda,AiSiqi and OtherComrades inHangzhou(Zai Hangzhou yuChenBodaAiSiqi deng tongzhi de tanhua),Dec.21,1965,fromLongLiveMaoZedongThought(MaoZedong sixiangwansui),Vol.5,p.249,printed inWuhan,1967-1968./8Peking Review,No.30,p.6.July 27,1973.

220and carry out mass movements. Liu Shaoqi, together with Deng Xiaoping, in thissense, were not true communists any more when they deviated from the mass line andtried to suppress mass movements in the early stage of the CR. Liu Shaoqi told hischildren: “I have no experience of running a movement in this fashion undersocialism; nor have Iever in the past come across our party using this form ofrectification."',Liu's explanation here was a mere excuse; the key was not aboutexperiences of leaders, but about whether or not leaders should follow the mass line.

Characterizing the big-character poster as a manifesto of a Chinese ParisCommune in the sixties of the twentieth century alsorevealed the enormoussignificance of the Paris Commune model for Mao Zedong Thought. In fact, manytheoretical breakthroughs and practical creations manifested as "socialist new thingsthat took shape during the CR era (1966-1976),could,in one way or another, betracedbackorrelatedtotheParisCommune

Conceptualizing the transformation, defense and advancement of socialism ascontinuous revolution centering on mass movements, Mao not only further developedthe principles of the Paris Commune, but also laid a firm philosophical foundation forthe CR, thus paving the wayfor further explorations and creations in theory andpractice. Upon such a theoretical foundation, we can now move on to concrete aspectsin the CR that echoed theParis Commune of nearly one century earlier79 Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, Mao's Last Revolution, Cambridge: Harvard Uiversity Press,p.63,2006.

221TheSixteenPoints:CallforModelingupon theParis

Commune

Mao's “Bombard the Headquarters—My Big-Character Poster”was releasedamong top leaders of the CCP in Zhongnanhai, Beijing on August 5, 1966. In thisposter, Mao mainly accused the Liu-Dengists of making "white terror” among themasses, and the historical Rightists deviations conducted by Liu-Dengists in 1962 and1964. Under its influence, the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth CentralCommittee of the Communist Party of China (which lasted 12 days from August 1stto12th andincludedrepresentativesfrom theRed Guard)finallyadopted an officialprogram for the CR on August 8. This is “The Decision of the CCP CentralCommittee Concerning the GreatProletarian Cultural Revolution",whichlater cametobegenerallyknown asTheSixteenPoints.

Succinctly,this"16-pointGuideline"touchedonfundamentalissuesofhowthe CR should be carried out and what its significance was. It clarified the targets ofthe revolution inPoint 5: “Who are our enemies?Who are our friends? This is aquestionof thefirstimportancefortherevolutionanditislikewise aquestionof thefirst importance for the great Cultural Revolution.*8o Yet as Mao acknowledged laterduring the CR, there was no easy answer to this question. It is easier in war time toidentify who the enemies and friends are, he said, but during peace time such as the1960s in China, it is tough to tell who is who. Actually, it was right on this foremost80Decisionof theCentralCommitee of theChinese CommunistPartyConcerningtheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution(AdoptedonAugust 8,1966),inPekingReview,Vol.9,No.33,Aug.1966

222important issue that the so-called seemingly monolithic “Maoists", includingLiu-Dengists, who claimed they had always been loyal to Mao's revolutionary linefell into different camps during the CR - even though all of those who attended theEleventh Plenum on August 1966, including Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping.approved the Sixteen Points at the meeting. For the genuine Maoists who were infavor of the CR as a large-scale class struggle, the main targets in this movementshould be persons in authority who sympathized with the capitalist mode ofproduction and management. This was a significant difference from the Anti-RightistMovement in the late 1950s.As The 16-point Guideline states:“The main target ofthe present movement is those within the Party who are in authority and are taking thecapitalist road." But other party bureaucrats, i.e., Liu-Dengists, basically had the viewthat the CR was no more than another round or rounds of the “anti-rightist movement"With regard to the ongoing CR, similarly, the main targets for them, were differentthanwhat had been identified byMao and his adherents.Themain targetsfor theLiu-Dengists were the five categories of already-designated people in previouspolitical movements, namely, (former) landlords, rich peasants.counter-revolutionaries,badelements and Rightists,or touseMaoists’terms,the"dead tigers." These were people that were deprived of certain economical andpolitical rights after 1949 and hence considered no major threats to socialism. To putit another way, Liu-Dengists maintained that the main targets of struggle in the CRshould be directed to the “dead tigers” who mostly existed outside the party, while theMaoists saw the main targets as within the party, especially those who were in power

223and deviated from the socialist line. Judged from the different political performancesin the 17 years before the CR, these divergences were not only unavoidable, but alsoprefigured complicated developments,conflicts and struggles that were to developlater.

Even though LiuShaoqi facedfierce criticisms fromhis colleagues and had tomake some self-criticism after Mao released his “Bombard The Headquarters—MyBig-Character Poster'— that directly condemned Liu's capitalist policies from 1962to 1966 and the “white terror” persecutions of common people and cadres in the firstmonths of the CR— Liu's political influence remained strong among CCP cadres whchad similiar views.Infact,the 16-point Guideline,to some extent,represented acompromise between the Maoists and Liu-Dengists in the central committee of CCP.Nevertheless, at the same time, the Maoists and Liu-Dengists began to identify adifferent target for the struggles that would continue tointensify in later days of theCR.For example, it could be discerned from the text that the objective of the CR wasnot only "to struggle against and crush those persons in authority who are taking thecapitalist road,” but also “to criticize and repudiate the reactionary bourgeoisacademic‘authorities’and the ideology of the bourgeoisie and all other exploitingclasses."“Concentrate all forces to strike at the handful of ultra-reactionary bourgeoisRightists and counter-revolutionary revisionists."81That is to say, the Maoists andLiu-Dengists agreed that both power-holders taking the capitalist road and thereactionary bourgeois academic‘authorities'should be struggled against(conducted81 Ibid.

224by reasoning, not by coercion or force).But as the CR advanced, the Liu-Dengistsmainly struggled against the so-called “reactionary bourgeois scholar despots and'authorities'" and the defiant masses who were mostly outside the Party. Sometimesnon-intellectual middle-lower cadres within the party were also singled out asscapegoats for mass struggle in order to protect higher ranking bureaucrats. In sharpcontrast, the Maoist rebels mainly struggled against the so-called “persons in authoritywho are taking the capitalist road." Since those in authority naturally had moreorganized political, economic and military power, the Maoist activists usually sufferedthe most during the CR. Furthermore, some Liu-Dengist officials even thought themain purpose of the CR was merely to transform Chinese educational system just asthe name of“cultural revolution" implied. The main targets therefore werenon-communist intellectuals in the education system. This view was partly manifestedin the article 10“Educational Reform"of the 16-point guideline, that says “totransform the old educational system and the old principles and methods of teachingwas “a most important task."82 In other words, the Liu-Dengists tended to treat “amost important task" as the most important task of the CR

Among The 16-point Guideline,article 9 “Cultural Revolutionary GroupsCommittees and Congresses" clearly called for modeling on the Paris Commune.Article9ineffectdefined thenature andfeaturesoftheproposednewCommune,which might be the first and last call to promote the Paris Commune model in officialCCP decisions after 1949. Let us now take a close look at this and dwelt on its82Ibid.

225far-reachingsignificance.

Firstly, just as article 4 emphasized “let the masses educate themselves in themovement",theMaoists whohadlongbeendissatisfiedwiththe old state apparatussince it had become, more or less, a tool for capitalist restoration,wished that themasses could envision and find a wholly newform of state structure modeled on theParis Commune through participation of the current movement. They also hoped thatthis new form of state could empower the masses so as to prevent capitalist restorationinitiated by some of those who were power holders. They declared that they finallyfound what they wanted in the sixteen-point guidance after experimenting in thefirstthree months of the CR. Article 9 stated that many socialist new things “of greathistoric importance*83 already emerged, including but not limited to the culturalrevolutionary groups, committees and other organizational forms.

Secondly, these cultural revolutionary groups, committees and congresseswere not just “organs of power of the proletarian cultural revolution", but also“excellent new forms of organization whereby under the leadership of the CommunistParty the masses are educating themselves."Why did the masses need to educatethemselves?From the viewpoints of the Maoist leadership, the political and classconsciousness of the masses was by no means mature. They were highly worriedabout issue of the successors of the revolution as the masses were not well preparedfor potential political counter-strikes. In this regard, the CR could be seen as amovement for cultivating revolutionary successors. Mao repeatedly emphasizec83Ibid.

226before and after the launch of the CR that class struggle should be the main course foreveryone in favor of socialism and communism to learn from,and that the CR wasmeant to be a kind of military exercise and maneuver for possible class warfare in thefuture.For the extensive outburst of armed struggles around the whole country lateron, on the one hand, Mao was basically not in favor of the armed struggle as a methodof struggle in the CR, but when it occurred, Mao saw it as a good thing to some extentas "We don't have war experience for more than ten years..t is also an exercise *"84Only by bravely facing and challenging the fierce storm of class struggle, could themasses raise and refine their political and class consciousness, and could the workingclass advance from the state of "in-itself” to "by-itself', to use Marx's terms.A moredemocratic commune-type state structure could take shape amid the storm of classstruggle.

Thirdly, in the official guideline of the CR, even though the new forms of theorgans of the masses could wield power to carry out the CR, they could never replacethe Party. Rather, the Party should lead those mass organs. Since the mass organsshould be subject to the Party leadership, they were by no means totally independentorgans. At best, they were semi-independent and semi-autonomous.The culturalrevolutionary groups, committees, and the mass organization as a whole functioned aschannels that mediated between the masses and the Party. On the one hand, they coulddetermine their own cultural, economic, political, even military (with the Party'spermission) activities,and express their own concerns toward theParty and request84 Mao Zedong, Mao zhuxi zhongyao zhishi (Chairman Mao's Important Instructions), in Jianguo yilai MaoZedong wengao(TheManuscripts of MaoZedongSince theFoundation of thePRC).Vol.13,Beijing:Zhongyangwenxianchubanshe,1988,p.488

227responses from it. On the other hand, it could collect diverse opinions from the massorgans and act directly upon the mass' interests as long as they do not violate socialistprinciples, i.e. be against socialism and communism. In order to realize the CCP'slong-cherished “mass line"with a mass perspective—“from the masses, to themasses,” the mass organs were viewed as complementary to the Party. Therefore thecultural revolutionary groups, committees, and the mass organization as a whole weremore efficient in fighting against the party bosses’ commandism than the former localparty branches or organizations directly led by the Party, such as women's unions, thecommunist youth league, workers'unions before the CR.

Fourthly, these cultural revolutionary groups, committees and congresses, asorgans of power of the proletarian Cultural Revolution should not be temporary butpermanent and standing mass organizations. They should be established not only incolleges, schools, various levels of government and other organizations, but also forfactories, mines, other enterprises, urban districts and villages. That is, they should beestablished throughout the country. Moreover, theParis Commune style generalelections should be applied in order to form such mass organs:

It is necessary to institute a system of general elections, like that of theParis Commune, for electing members to the cultural revolutionarygroups and committees and delegates to the cultural revolutionarycongresses. The lists of candidates should be put forward by therevolutionary masses after full discussion,and the elections should beheld after the masses have discussed the lists over and over again.

Similar to stipulations practiced by the Paris Commune, article 9 stated that allelected committeemembersweresubjecttobereplaced orrecalled if necessary

228Lastbutnottheleast,article9states:The cultural revolutionary groups, committees and congresses incolleges and schools should consist mainly of representatives of therevolutionary students.At the same time, they should have a certainnumber of representatives of the revolutionary teaching staff andworkers.

Clearly, various powers in favor of the CR on this principle should participatein the power organs and share power. At the time the 16-point guideline was issued.the armed forces had yet to participate in the CR. In colleges and schools, the firstexperimental fields for carrying out the CR, therefore, a kind of “two-in-one” sharingschema,which consisted of revolutionary students and teachingstaff and workerswas arranged in line with the 16-point guideline. This is more or less a rudimentaryform of the later “three-in-one” combination power structure that Mao personallyapproved.As the armed forces entered into the CR, their role was bound tobe crucial.Eventually, the “two-in-one” combination arrangement would be replaced by the“"three-in-one” combination, within which the army was often a major player in thetriple arrangement that also involved representatives from the masses and veterancadres who were still“revolutionary".As for the armed forces,the 16-point guidelinegave only one simple sentence in article 15.

Acarefulreadingofarticle9alsorevealedcompromisesordifferentinterpretations between the Maoists and Liu-Dengists on the role of the existing CRcommittees.Although this articleclaimed that these cultural revolutionarygroups andcommitteeswereformedontheinitiativeofthemasses,thiswasfarfromthecomplete story. As can be seen, before Mao returned to Beijing from his trip in thesouthern provinces at the end of July, the CR had already been carried out throughoutthe country for more than two months under direct and active guidance of theLiu-Dengists. On June 3, Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping sent out work teams tomajor colleges and middle schools to tame—-or more precisely——suppress the politicalmomentum of the masses. According to many memoirs available today, most of suchcultural revolutionarygroups and committees wereinfact established under theguidance of and with full support from persons in authorityin many cases, workteams. For example, Lu Yanfu, a low ranking cadre who followed the Liu-Dengistsline at theearlystageoftheCR and a xiaoyangpai (bystander)after theEleventhPlenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CCP in August 1966recollected:

At the beginning of June 1966, the Gansu Provincial Party Committeesent a work group (gongzuozu) to Lanzhou University. On June 7,1966, students with different positions put up posters debating the roleof the University Party Committee. The work group supported onefaction and suppressed another.... Some suppressed students sent atelegram to the Center to report the situation....For fear that thestudents would demonstrate on the street, the Gansu Provincial Party

Committee formed a [bigger]work team (gongzuotuan) thisstrategy and tactics onhow topush the CRforwardwith regard to the army.Miscalculation about thefunction ofthe army in the CR was inevitable.In fact, this was an Achilles'heel of the CR.

Even thoughsome of the cultural revolutionarygroups and committeeswerepublicly elected, their candidates were more or less subject to the censorship or atleast acquiescence of work teams or people in power who had close tie with the workteams.Very often, the chosen candidates were willingly cooperative activists, whowere usually members of the Party or the Communist Youth League and from cadresfamilies. Most of them were sturdy supporters of work teams and the hierarchicalstate structure. They were accordingly labeled as "loyalists"and“conservatives" bythe rebels later. Thus, these cultural revolutionary groups and committees in 1966were actually official orsemi-officialentitiesmainlymediatingbetween theconservative activists and thepartybranches or work teams.Theyserved the CR'sgeneral strategies and tactics mapped out by Liu-Dengists in the Central Committee of86LuanfuTelltePeplethHistoricalTruthTheMorehanFiftyDaysWhitTerorinLanuUnivesityattheEarlyStageoftheCR(Balishizhenxianggaosurenmin:wengechuqilanzhoudaxuedewushiduotianbaisekongbu),see http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=6449,cited on September 25,2009.The manipulationof the election of CR committees by work teams was a popular practice at that time. Shen Ruhuai, one of the mostadamant leaders of the pro-establishment Red Guard faction"April 14"(siyaosi) in Qinghua University of Beijing,who had been the party secretary of his class before the CR, recounts: "On June 9,1966, the new BeijingMunicipalParty Committee sent a huge work team consisting of 513 persons,which was led byYeLin [yetactually controlled byWang Guangmei,the wife of the state chairman LiuShaoqi].Upon the arrival of the team,the cadres at all levels of the UniversityParty Committee were dismissed from their positions.The work team,replacing theUniversityParty Committee tofunction,led the CR in the campus....The work team established CRCommittees in all departments and appointed corresponding Committee members.Naturally,those studentsactivelyopposingJiang[JiangNaxiang,thepresident of QinghuaUniversity],whowerechildren ofhighPartycadres,became thereliable objects of thework team and the CR Committees'members.A daughter of a highofficialwasgivenresponsibilityinmy classwhile theoriginal CommunistYouthLeague and the Class Committeestopped running.

231the CCP. All of them generally endorsed the pre-CR order that benefited them most.

In this regard, how could these kinds of cultural revolutionary groups andcommittees be models for the newParis Commune style power organs?Furthermoreeven if theywerefree of anypressuresfrom work teams or thelocal partybranches.was there any possibility of electing cultural revolutionary groups or committees thatsincerely embraced the theory and practice of continuous revolution? Under thegeneral political environment of a party cult at that time, this was quite questionableFrom the beginning of the CR, the rebels were always in the minority. Even thoughMaoist leaders repeatedly called for rebellion against the old state apparatus, inpractice, it was still difficult if not impossible for the rebels to recruit enough peopleto outnumber the so-called conservative masses. In places where the rebels formed themajority, almost without exception, they were hampered by infighting amongsub-factions of the rebels partially due to the powerful influence of power-holdersThe realization of a new Paris Commune-style general election, indeed, suggested arealdilemmafortheMaoistleadership.

But at least at the time of issuing the 16-point guideline, Maoist leaders inBeijing still hoped that the majority of the masses would come to their side. For them,a given organizationalform could be used as a tool forboth non-revolutionary andrevolutionary purposes.Although many cultural revolutionary groups and committeesat the early stage of the CR had become tools for party bureaucrats to resist andsuppress the revolution before the issuance of the 16-point guideline, the stipulatiorof article 9 still conveyed a clear message to the masses who were unprecedentedly

232and activelyparticipating in this great political movement. It was a message aboutwhat thefuture state should look like, and how thefuture power system should bestructured andformulated.NeverbeforeinChinesehistorywasthedirectionof thefuture literally put in the hands of the masses. Moreover what was put in the hands ofthe masses at the same time was the struggle for the right to interpret and practice theParis Commune model, along with the struggle for the right to interpret and practicethe so-called cult of personality toward Mao,?′ the incarnation of revolution. Theunderlying linchpin was class struggle, with which the class and politicalconsciousness of the proletariat could be promoted and grow mature. For manypeople involved in this unprecedented heaven-storming mass movement, this was alife-or-death battle. Only when the rebels won the class struggle against advocates ofcapitalist practices in the Party and the conservative, i.e., as yet class-unconsciousmasses,could the building of a newParis Commune in China become a realityOtherwise it would be inevitably postponed, regardless of the wishes of its initiators.Just as Marx pointed out with regard to the Paris Commune that “apart from the factthat this was merely the rising of a city under exceptional conditions, the majority ofthe Communewas in nowaysocialist,nor could it be.With a modicum ofcommon-sense, however, it could have reached a compromise with Versailles usefulto the whole people - the only thing that could be attained at the time.*88 Beforematerial conditions andmaturedclass consciousnesswereready,itwasimpossiblefon87SeeMariceJMeisnerMarxismMaoism,andUtpianism:EightEssays chapter6:Thecult ofMaoTseugpp.155-183,Univrsty oWisconsin Press,1982.MarxtoF.Domela-Nieuwenhuis,February,22,1881,fromMarx/EngelsCollectedWorks(MECW),Volume 46p.65,NewYork:InternationalPublishers,1968.

233a democraticParisCommunetypepowerorgan tosurviveProletarian Dictatorship, General Election and the Paris Commune

Signaled by the 16-point program, the Paris Commune was finally andofficially put on the stage of history in the CR. Right after the curtain fell on theEleventh PlenarySession of theEighth Central Committee of the CCP, theParty'stheoretical organ the Red Flag released a short yet important article entitled"theGeneralElectionSystemoftheParisCommune”byLiuHuiming(whichseemedtobe a pen name) on August 21, 1966, which intentionally elaborated article 9 of the16-point Guidance and touched on crucial issues concerning the ongoing events

This article reaffirmed Marx's theme that theParis Commune fundamentallynegated all the previous state power, stood squarely opposed to all the previous statemachines, and enabled “the masters of society" to be “people's servants." This ineffect, as I mentioned before, conveyed the Maoists’discontent toward the pre-CRstate machinery. Bold and clear, it was more or less a negation of the ways thatformed andstructured thepre-CRstatemachine.From theverybeginning of thehistory of commune after liberation in 1949, whether it was the people's communes inrural areas from 1958 onward,or the defunct people's communes in cities that weremodeled after their rural counterparts, or the proposed commune model during the CRthe Maoist leadership always regarded communes as, so to speak, semi-autonomousunits and tools for the broad masses to realize their democratic rights. To quote a

234Maoistsaying,the communewas thegoldenbridge tocommunism.Thiswasconsistent with Mao's dialectics of centralized and decentralized power structure. Thesomewhat decentralized Commune-type entities complemented and balanced theshortcomings of the Soviet system characterized by heavily centralized powerstructure. During the Great Leap Forward, most rural communes were warmlywelcomed by peasants and cadres. But things always varied over space and time. Inareas with a longer history of Democratic Revolution, the masses had a betterunderstanding of their democratic rights and worked more successfully with thenewly-established communes in production and in political activities. Relationshipsamong the state, the party, and the local communes, and the masses usually ransmoothly. But in areas where the Democratic Revolution tradition had been shortervery often, the masses did not take active initiative, and local Liu-Dengist partybosses dominated. The communes there usually did not function well enough to serveas efficient democratic tools. Tensions between the state, the party, and localcommunes grew continuously. As a result, tragedies such as starvation, given theconditions oflow productivity in China at that time,inevitablyhappened in someareas controlled by Liu-Dengist bureaucrats.In fact, during the initial phase of theGreat LeapForward in1958, Mao even tried to propagate the commune model for thewhole of country,not just limited to the rural areas as a negation of the old statemachinery and a way of empowering the masses. Nevertheless, due to the partialsetbacks of the Great Leap Forward in the following years and the low level ofdemocratic consciousness of the masses in many places—or using Maoists

235terminology, due to the sabotage of class enemies—Mao had to temporarily give upthis idea. In the mid 60s, the Maoist leadership made up their mind to promote theParis commune model throughout the entire country in a storm of intensive classstruggle. “They are suitable not only for colleges, schools and government and otherorganizations, but generally also for factories, mines, other enterprises, urban districtsand villages."(The 16-point program, article 9) It attempted to limit and reduce thepower of the state and the party, but extended the power of communes assemi-autonomous,democraticpower organs

As discussed before,after the establishment of thePRC,thefirst constitutionwas released in 1954, among which the first article stated that China was a “people'sdemocratic state led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers andpeasants." In the preamble of this constitution, China was designated as executing‘people's democratic dictatorship." But after the completion of socialisttransformation in all spheres of Chinese society, and especially with the launch of theGreat LeapForward,there was animminent drive within and outside theParty toadvance China from people's democratic dictatorship to the dictatorship of theproletariat. This signified by no means only a nominal shift. But many cadres in theparty lagged behind or were not willing to continue the revolution. They even overtlyor covertly opposed Maoists’advancements.As a result, the tense two line struggle inthe party made the CR inevitable. Maoists’ efforts toward this goal culminated in1975 when the second version of the Chinese constitution stipulated, in its first article.that China was “a socialist state of the dictatorship of the proletariat led by the

236working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants."This was a tellingmanifestation andlogical result ofMao's theories andpractices ofcontinuousrevolution. Seen along this vein, Liu Huiming's article “The General Election Systemof the Paris Commune" represented an effort to call for this great transformation. Innegating the old people's democratic dictatorship, it aimed to vigorously mobilize themasses to realize proletarian power in this historical conjuncture.Hence, whendiscussing the Paris Commune, Liu's article put much emphasis upon the nature of theParisCommune'sproletariandictatorship

The Paris Commune model featuring “general elections" played a pivotal rolein Mao's drama of continuous revolution. How did the Paris Commune manage tomaintain its proletarian dictatorship?Differing from Zheng Zhisi's stress on therevolutionary violent power-seizure, Liu Huiming paid attention to the role of'general election" in line with the Paris Commune legacy, aiming at elaboratingarticle 9 of the “Sixteen-point Guidance". Liu argued that “in order to guarantee itsproletarian nature and to realize its function of proletarian dictatorship, theParisCommune created and conducted a general election, which was of historicalsignificance." Before the CR, the legitimacy of PRC state power was not really inquestion, because never before were Chinese people's democratic rights realized sodeeply and broadly. Many positions, especially at grass-root levels, such as factories,schools, urban districts and villages, were directly elected by the masses. Nevertheless,there was still a problem in terms of political participation by the broad masses. TheParis Commune stipulated that all leaders should be elected by the people. Then how

237about theChinesestate apparatus?Even thoughmanycadres tookoffice throughelections for positions in the government and the party, a good number of thecandidates were nominated by the party. Moreover, many positions were directlyappointed by the Party. There was a need to unite the national bourgeoisie andnon-communists to participate in the establishment of the new China. For examplemany Democrats and bourgeois forces, even former Guomindang leftists werenominated and elected as ministers in various state departments.Election procedures.in that case, were to some extent a kind of political formality since candidates were infact “pre-selected" by the CCP which made strategic adjustments, such as not havingcompetitive candidates for a given position in order to guarantee the final electionresults. When a cadre was chosen and appointed directly by his leaders, he tended to(even though not always) estrange himself from the masses and just feel responsibleto his leaders -which could lead tobeing a supporter of a hierarchical capitalistrestoration.Such phenomena sometimes caused a good many complaints from themasses.

Consequently, some of the supposed "people's servants", faced with thebureaucratization of the state apparatus, gradually degenerated into “masters ofsociety", transforming themselves from communist revolutionaries to advocates ofrevisionism and capitalist rule so as to protect their own privileged interests. To learnfrom the Paris Commune meant learning how to prevent the “servants" from beoming“masters" of the society. Inspired by the spirit of the Paris Commune and armed withthe theoretical weapon of continuous revolution, Maoist writers such as Liu Huiming

238under the authorization of theMaoist leadership calledfor a real"generalelection'aimed at “smashing the old state machinery” entirely and seizing power for theproletariat for the first time in China.For quite a while during the CR, the “generalelection"was regarded by many Maoists as a key link to recapture and restoreproletarian dictatorship. But ironically, the call for “general election" was also used byconservative forces that were usually in the majority, as a weapon to oppose the CRand its supporters. For example, Li Hongshan, a Red Guard in Beijing ForestryInstitute, claimed that the CCRG was illegal as it had not been elected and did nottherefore have the legitimacy of the electoral process.89

In 1930, which was a difficult time in the Red Army era, Mao Zedong - inresponding to Lin Biao's doubts about the future of Chinese revolution - was positivethat a high tide of revolution would come. Judging the revolutionary situation at thattime, Mao wrote confidently and vividly that, “It is like a ship far out at sea whosemasthead can already be seen from the shore; it is like the morning sun in the eastwhose shimmering rays are visible from a high mountain top; it is like a child about tobe born moving restlessly in its mother's womb.*9o Yet would Mao and his followersin1966have thesame confidence about thelong-expected ChineseParisCommune?Would the Maoists'theoretical visions be fully carried out in the CR?

RevolutionA So-called“Paris Commune-StyleElection"at Shanghai

No.17 Textile Mill

After the pass of the“Circular of the Central Committee of the CommunistParty of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution" on May 16, 1966, thefirst wave of the CR surged throughout China. The first battlefield was set on thecampuses. On May 25, seven young instructors and staff people in the PhilosophyDepartment at Peking University put up the first big-character poster, which washailed by Mao Zedong as “the declaration of the Chinese Paris commune of the sixtiesof the twentieth century."Mao stated that, “Its significance surpasses the ParisCommune,*? because it revealed the chilling reality that party bureaucrats hadactuallybeen attempting toput out thefast-spreadingwildfire of theCR.Inresponseto this,Maopersonally ordered that this big-character poster be broadcast nationwideon June 1, 1966.And this greatly encouraged all the potential activists, not only on thecampuses, but also in factories, various levels of government, urban districts, andvillages.1 The materials in this section are mainly based on two pamphlets: “Disclose the Capitalist Reactionary Line oftheMunicipalWorkTeamledbyShiHuizhen”(Jieluyi ShiHuizhenweishoudeshiweigongzuoduidezichan jiejifandong luxian),by the Fighting Team (zhandou dui) of Loyal to Mao's Thought Forever in the No.17 Textile Mill,published inDecember 8",1966;“The RevolutionaryLocomotive in the“Red Stronghold':On the First SixCommunistsWhoStood Out from the Shanghai No.17 Textile Mill"(Hongsebaolei lidegeminghuochetou: jiguomian shiqi changzuizao sha chulai deliuge gongchan dangyuan).Mao supports theRed Guards,21July1966,ThePeople'sRepublicof China:1949-1979,A DocumentarySurvey,Vol. 3,p.1552,Ed.Harold C.Hinton,Scholarly Resources Inc.Wilmington,Delaware.

Amid the storm of the Red Guard movement, the majority of the rank-and-fileworkers werenotfully involved in thefirst wave of theCR.But alongwithsix otherworkers, Wang Hongwen, who later became one of the key rebel leaders in Shanghaigrasping the historical significance of Mao's earnest call for a new revolution,wereamong the first to be fully involved in the Cultural Revolution. Wang, a veteran of theKorean War, had been working at the Shanghai's No. 17 Textile Mill for ten years.first as a maintenance worker (baoquangong) and then as the factory's security chief.On June 12, 1966, inspired by Nie Yuanzi and her colleagues' wall poster, the 7 rebelsat No. 17 Textile Mill put up a big-character poster entitled “See through theMake-ups of the Party Branch to Get the Truth Out" in the factory. Putting out theslogan of "bringing down the bourgeois authorities, uprooting the deep-rooted oldrevisionism!" in this poster, Wang and his comrades accused Zhang Heming, thevice-secretary of the factory's party branch', of “revisionism,” offering a good deal ofevidence to question the old party committee: “why do you avoid class struggle likethe plague? Doesn't your revisionist line of cadres intend topave the way forcapitalism?Where do you want to lead our whole factory with eight thousandworkers?" Like a heavy bomb that broke through the once murky silence, thisbig-character poster hit right at the heart of the party committee. Zhang Heming andhis men were so scared that they hurried to lay siege to Wang Hongwen and hiscomrades trying to divide and demoralize them, following and spying on them. Usingall of their resources and power, they tried their best to stamp out the flames kindled3 Shanghai No. 17 Textile Millhad no party secretary at that time, and the vice-secretary Zhang Heming was thetopleader at thefactory.

242by the big-character poster.* Late on the night of June 19,Zhang Heming and histrusted aides broke into and rummaged through the office where Wang and his twocomrades were composing other posters. This later became known as ^the June 19incident". The next day, June 20, they besieged Wang Hongwen and branded him andthe cosigners of the poster as"thePetofi club",calling them counterrevolutionariesand accusing them of intending to initiate an "armed uprising” similar to that ofHungry in 1956. They even demanded that fire engines be ready and had raw cottonstorehouses closely watched and warded,as if faced with a formidable foe.Thefactory authorities considered everybody who came close to Wang Hongwen and hiscomrades to be a suspected member of Wang Hongwen's so-called"counterrevolutionary group” and they were threatened with expulsion from the partyif he or she was a Communist Party member.° This was really a “Sword ofDamocles" that hung above the heads of Wang Hongwen and his comrades

Not yielding to the political persecution from the factory authorities, WangHongwen and his comrades kept persuading and recruiting more workers to struggleagainst their opponents. The Shanghai municipal administration had to send in a work4 See the pamphlet entitled *The Revolutionary Locomotive in the ‘Red Stronghold': On the First SixCommunistsWhoStoodOutfromtheShanghaiNo.17TextileMill(Hongsebaoleilidegeminghuochetou:jiguomianshiqichangzuizaoshachulaideliugegongchandangyuan)fromhttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=3889,cited20,July,2009.Unless otherwiseindicated,all translationsaremyown.5 The Petofi Club was a literati forum critical of the workers’power in Hungary before the 1956 anti-communistriot.

Ontheonehand,theteamleaderYuWei more orlesssympathizedwith therebelworkersOn the other hand, the workers, inspired by the People's Daily editorial'RevolutionaryBig-Character Posters Are Demon-Detectors To Unveil All GhostsAnd Monsters"released on June 20, gathered new momentum to make all-roundattacks on the factory party committee represented by the vice secretary ZhangHeming. The whole factory, which had over eight-thousand employees, seethed withsurging revolutionary activities. Just from the 7th to 19th of July, rebel workers in thisfactory led by Wang Hongwen wrote 7,525posters bombarding the factory's partycommittee.7

The Shanghai municipal administration felt that it was losing control of events.So they recalled Yu Wei's old work team and sent in a new and higher-level workteamled byShi Huizhen,a femaleveteran revolutionary and atthat time thevice-chairperson of the Shanghai General Workers'Union. This new work teamconsistedofmorethanonehundredmemberswhotheShanghai authorities trustedOn July 20, Shi Huizhen gave a talk to the whole factory with a tone that depicted thefactory authorities as only “making some grave mistakes to repress the big characterposter writing", rather than“suppressing the revolutionary mass movement".8 Insteadof targeting the party authorities, the new team leader called for putting up big7SeeYe Yonglie,Wang Hongwen zhuan (The Biography of Wang Hongwen), from Ye Yonglie jishi wenji (ACollection ofYeYonglie's DocumentaryEssays),Vol.5,p.46,Xinjiang renmin chubanshe,2000.*From the pamphlet “Disclose the Capitalist Reactionary Line of the Municipal Work Team led by Shi Huizhen"(Jieluyi Shi Huizhenweishou deshiwei gongzuoduidezichan jieji fandong luxian),by theFightingTeam(zhandou dui)of Loyal to Mao'sThought Forever in the No.17TextileMill,published in December 8,1966personalcollection.

244character posters to disclose each other's “grave bourgeois thoughts”among theordinary workers. This new policy led to chaotic fights among the masses, sinceeverybody could be accused of having some bourgeois thoughts. And the effect of thiswas to protect a small bunch of power holders in the factory

The newwork team had todeal with the problems of thefactory's topauthorities, which were greatly revealed by the big-character posters. But this time, onthe pretext that the masses did not know much about the authorities, the work teamrefused toinvolve any commonworkers as representatives in theirconferences,tosaynothing of welcoming workers’suggestions or investigations. The workers wereenraged by the work team's attitudes toward the masses and the delayed andsuperficial resolution of the problems in the factory. In August the workers produced agreat number of posters targeting the work team,which clearly showed that therelationshipbetween workers and the work team was rapidly deteriorating. After therelease of the16-pointProgramby theCCP Central Committee(hereafterreferred toas the Center), Shi Huizhen presided over a workers'congress on August 10,1966, atwhich she hinted that some workers paid only lip service to support the CR, when infact they opposed iti.e. they were waving red flags to oppose the red flag. Rebelslater considered this an obvious signal of revisionism - mobilizing conservativeworkers to attack rebels and in this way suppressing the mass movement in the factory.Instigated and manipulated by the work team, the conservative workers, who were amajority in the factory, waged all-round struggles against the rebels. Long besiegedthe rebels were stuck with the labels of being “anti-party and anti-socialism" and

245'ghosts and monsters". Their big-character posters were treated as “poisonous weeds".Somerebelswereevenbeatenuntil theyvomittedblood.

On August 18, Mao received one million Red Guards at Tian'anmen Square inBeijing and encouraged the masses to take an active part in the CR. Mao wore a PLAmilitary uniform and a Red Guard's armband as a supportive gesture toward the RedGuards. Upon hearing this news, Wang Hongwen and his comrades decided toorganize Workers Red Guards among their factory's militia. The work team was veryscared by this move and regarded it as a“counter-revolutionary power seizure".Thevice leader of the work team Zhang Ge said: “This is by no means a minor issue; it isclass struggle. Wang Hongwen and his like are seizing power!" To counter this, thework team formed the official workers Red Guards even before Wang Hongwenorganized theirs. Zhao Ge suggested: “Let's do it first no matter how many workerswould join in. If we form Red Guards first, we are legal. Wang and his like have tojoin us. If they don't, let them be." The later city-level conservative workersorganizations were actually based on this kind of loyalist factions in various Shanghaifactories.The hardliners of conservative workers’organizations were usually drawnfromtheranksofskilledworkers,manyofwhichweremembersoftheCommunistParty or the Communist Youth League, or were model workers respected in the wholesociety. Those old skilled workers oftenfelt great reverence for the CommunistParty,since many of them had lived a wretched life under the Nationalist regime, and theireconomical, political, and social status rose significantly after Liberation in 1949.9Ibid.

The16-pointProgram,astheguidingdocumentof theCultural Revolutionhad already been distributed throughout China to all levels of units (danwei) after itspublication by the People's Daily on August 9, 1966. It paid much attention to culturalrevolutionary groups, committees, and other organizational forms, calling fonmodeling the Paris Commune by instituting a system of general elections. These kindsof cultural revolutionary groups and committees were regarded by the Maoistleadership as leading organs for the CR. Therefore, their formation and operationbecame a focal point for all competingpolitical powers

To take the leadership of and justify their control over the ongoing CR, thework team zealously called for a "Paris Commune Style Election" at Shanghai No. 17Textile Mill. Paying lip service to general elections in the factory, the work team mademanydecisionsinthename of commonworkersyetwithout their actual consent.Before the“general elections",in order to ensure the desired result, the work teamgerrymandered the rules, regrouped the workers to benefit their chosen candidates,and even persuaded some potential competing candidates to withdraw. Their strategywas to guarantee the success of some docile workers while excluding the rebels fromthe leadership of the cultural revolutionary committee.On the pretext of broadeningrepresentation, for example, the Transportation Team in the factory passed othercandidateswhilepushing asidemostrebelsfrom theleadershipof theculturarevolutionary committee. In the Political Department of the factory, some “die-hardloyalists”to the work team —who were actually loyal to the pre-CR Party order ingeneral—were successfully elected because of the regrouping arrangement that had

247been done by the work team.10

In the Security Department, where Wang Hongwen worked, the work teamfound faults in every candidate nominated by the masses,and produced their ownnominationlist.Theworkteamdemanded thattheworkersintheSecurityDepartment cast votes only within the list. And then, at the same time, the work teamsent two cadres from the Security Department along with two work team members tomediateandalleviateworkers'discontent.Tothosewhodisobeyed,Cui Qingchaoone of the two cadres, stated that voting for designated candidates was a major issueof principle, while another cadre Dong Guifang remarked at a meeting about theelectionfor the Cultural Revolutioncommittee that“some people tried tomakewavesfor the cultural revolutionary committee election.We need tokeep record and let's geteven with themlater."Cui Qingchao even clearly threatened that:“we'll make thosepeople pay for this later.'11

In addition to these tricks,the head of the workteam even announced rightbefore the election that votes for persons other than those listed candidates arrangedby theworkteamwouldnotbe counted at all,forfearthat theworkerswould stillvoteforthosetheydidnotwant.Theworkteamtriedwhatevertheycouldtotakecontrolofthevotingprocess,andtomakesurewhoevertheychosewouldbeelectedAs a result, a number of conservative activists deeply involved in suppressing therebel mass movement wereelected into theleadership of the Cultural Revolutionary10The ms “lyalst and“conservativewere widlyused during thR,esecially at thendf 196ad1967,to refer those who supported the pre-CR party and state system and defended the pre-CR order. Usually theywere accused by the rebels as political tools of the Liu-Dengist revisionist line.For fear of splitting the masses,theMaoist leadership did not advocate calling those people “loyalist” and “conservative”. Instead, their organizationswere named“mass organizations”rather than"loyalist organizations”and“conservative organizations.11Ibid.

248committee.1? Nevertheless, since Wang Hongwen enjoyed great prestige and strongsupport among the rebel workers, he entered into the final list, running for director ofthe Cultural Revolutionary committee of the factory, and competing with anothercandidate backed by the work team and conservative workers.To defame, the workteam mobilized many people to make personal attacks on him. Predictably, WangHongwen lost the election since the rebel workers were stilla minority at that time.13This was, as the work team and conservative activists in Shanghai No. 17 Textile Millclaimed, a “Paris Commune Style Election"

The Formation of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel

General Headquarters (WGH) and the Anting Battle14

After Mao received Red Guards for the first time in Beijing on August 18.1966, many Beijing students went to Shanghai to“exchange revolutionaryexperiences." Keeping in mind Mao's teaching that revolutionary students mustintegrate into the workers’movement, the Red Guards went into Shanghai factories.On the surface, the Shanghai authorities welcomed the Beijing Red Guards as"Chairman Mao's guests", but they were actually very hostile to them. On Sept. 2,some students were beaten by conservative workers. The next day, when Beijing RedGuards demonstrated in front of Shanghai's city hall demanding meeing with top12Ibid.13SeeYeYonglie,TheBiography ofWangHongwen(WangHongwenzhuan),fromACollection ofYeYonglie'sDocumentary Essays (Ye Yonglie jishi wenji), Vol. 5,pp.49-52,Xinjiang renmin chubanshe, 2000.14 WGH is the abbreviation of the “Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters”(Gong ZongSi).

249cadres about the incident,the Shanghai government summoned many workers to thespot for protection, including 700 workers from Shanghai No. 17 Textile Mill on theorder of work team led by Shi Huizhen'?A physical fight developed between the RedGuards and Shanghai workers, resulting in bloodshed. The rebel workers went toprovide support to the students, showing their help with the Red Guards in theircommon struggle against the authorities. On Sept. 4, representatives of rebel workersandstudents held ajoint rally at theEasternChinaTextile TechnologyInstituteexpressing their solidarity with each other. On the same day, when the Red Guardsstruck the Shanghai city hall, rebel workers also went to display their solidarity, eventhough both the rebel students and workers were still outnumbered by loyalist workersand citizens on the spot.16

Regardless of openpersecution andsecretsabotage executed by thework teamand conservative workers, Wang Hongwen and more than 30 rebel workers made uptheir minds to form a fighting team on October 11, 1966, with the name, “FaithfullyCarrying Out the Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the Bitter End " (shisi jiangwuchanjiejiwenhuadagemingjinxingdaodizhandoudui).Thiswas anearlyattemptin Shanghai by the workers to form their organization on their own initiative. Afterthat, Wang Hongwen managed to visit Beijing with 14 comrades, and they went tomany units to exchange experiences, such as Beijing University, Qinghua Universityand Beijing No.1and No.2 Textile Mills. To their great excitement, they got a chance15 From the pamphlet Disclose the Capitalist Reactionary Line of the Municipal Work Team led by Shi Huizhen'(JieluyiShi Huizhen weishoude shiwei gongzuodui dezichan jieji fandong luxian),by theFightingTeam(zhandou dui) of Loyal to Mao's Thought Forever in the No. 17 Textile Mill, published in December 8", 1966,personalcollection.From the pamphlet“A Summary of ShanghaiWGH's Struggle”(Shanghai gongren geming zaofan zong silingbu douzheng jiyao),in the series of January Storm,ed.and printed by the WGH, Shanghai.

250tojoin the Red Guards tobe received by Mao at theTiananmenSquare on October 181966. When they returned to Shanghai, they found that another rebel workersfighting team named “Always Loyal to Mao Zedong's Thought" had been establishedat their factory. Due to Wang Hongwen's prestige and organizational skills, the tworebel groups merged into one and Wang was elected its new leader. The new groupsoon attracted more than one thousand rebel workers. Nevertheless, right before WangHongwen's return to Shanghai, to counter rebels' fighting teams, and with the strongsupport of the work team,conservative workers in the factory formed their ownorganization named "The Committee of Defending Mao Zedong thought." Theyrecruited about five thousand workers,which greatly outnumbered the rebels in thefactory. At its inauguration ceremony, work team leader Shi Huizhen gave a warmspeech,welcomingtheformation of theCommittee.

Realizing that the suppression of rebel workers had in fact originated from theShanghai authorities, in addition to putting up posters in the factory, Wang Hongwen'srebel team posted many posters on the wall of the Shanghai Municipal Committee,attacking the city's main power-holders. At the same time, they actively exchangedexperienceswithsimilarrebelorganizationsinotherShanghaifactories.

On the night of November 5, rebel workers from various factories streamedinto the Shanghai Liaison Centre of the Third Capital's Red Guard RevolutionaryRebel General Headquarters (hereafter the Third Headquarters) for a meeting named‘Exchanging Revolutionary Experiences of Shanghai Rebel Workers". At this rally,Red Guard students and rebel workers swore to fight together. In the concluding

251speech, Bao Pao, a Red Guard from China Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijingproposed that theShanghai rebel workers should master their own destiny andestablish a city-wide rebel workers' organization. The next day, inspired by the jointrally, rebel representatives from 17 Shanghai factories gathered at 311 Yu ParkRoad.18 At this meeting, work teams sent to factories became the targets, and rebelworkers accused them of committing unrighteous crimes against the rebels. In orderto fight against “Liu-Dengists’ capitalist reactionary line", all representatives agreedto forge a great alliance, that is, a large city-wide rebel workers organization.19

On November 8, the day before the founding ceremony of the ShanghaiWorkers' Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters (hereafter the WGH), thecommitteein charge of preparingfor the ceremonysent representatives totheShanghai Municipal Committee several times. They asked Mayor Cao Diqiu to talk atthe inauguration the next day, in the hope that the WGH would be recognized byShanghai's party authorities. To their disappointment, however, Cao refused to evensee them,giving thepoor excuse that he was sick.Moreover, the Shanghai authoritiesadopted a “three no's" stance (that is, no-attendance, no-recognition and no-supporttowardtheWGH),andeventriedtheirbesttodeterworkersfromattendingtheceremony by issuing an order that workers could not take off work to attend it.2017 See *Rebel Workers and the Chinese Human Right Movements: Interview with Pan Guoping, a Former LeadingOfficial of ShanghaiWorkersGeneralHeadquarters”(Gongrenzaofanpaiyuzhongguorenquanyundong:fangyuan Shanghai gong zong sifuze renPan Guoping),in Supplement to China News Digest(Huaxia wenzhaizengkan),No.99,1996.18These included Shanghai No.17Textile Mill, Shanghai GlassMachineryFactory,No.822Factory,ShanghaiNo.31 Textile Mill,Institute of SyntheticFibre Research,LianggongValve Factory,Loading and UnloadingMachineryRepair Plant of ShanghaiRailway Bureau,Shanghai May1Electrical plant,Jichu Company,andShanghaiNo.3SteelMill.9SeeZhangBaolin,Shanghai gongrengemingzaofanpai douzhenggaishu("A SummaryofShanghaiRevolutionary Rebel Workers' Struggle"), in January Storm, No. 4.20Shanghai shiweicankuzhengya gongren yundong de zuizenantao(TheSPC Cannot EscapeFrom theCriminalResponsibility of RuthlesslySuppressingWorkers'Movement),in Zhibu shenghuo(Life inPartyBranches),Nos.

252Mayor Caorepeatedlyrefusedworkers'requests to attend theinauguration and heeven openly declared: ^Now all the dregs of humanity in Shanghai come out for it. I'llnever attend it.If I do,Iwould makeserious mistakes."ThiswasbynomeansMayorCao's personal opinion about the rebels,but rather the shared view of the majority ofShanghai top cadres. Han Zheyi, a secretary of CCP East China Bureau stationed inShanghai, 'recalled, ^In our eyes, the so-called rebels were just some social dregswith serious problems. We harbored in our hearts a feeling of antipathy andabhorrence toward those guys."22 On November 9, the Shanghai authorities secretlyinstigated theloyalist workers to twice attack the ceremonial presidium and played theworkers and Red Guards off against each another. Due to Mayor Cao's insistence onrefusing to acknowledge theWGH, the ceremonyhad tobe postponed for more thantwo hours.At last, the Shanghai Municipal Committee sent Zhang Wenbao, merely adeputy minister of the Department of Organization, to the inauguration, yet he notonly refused to make speech, but also claimed that the Shanghai authorities wouldnever recognize the WGH.23

Nevertheless,November 9witnessed thecomingintoexistenceof theWGH2-3 (Combined issue), Jan 17,1967. Ed. by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Zhibu shenghuo, Shanghai.p.50.2l East China Bureau was one of the six regional bureaus that were direct appendages of the Center led bymembers or alternates of the central committee of CCP. As the highest power organ in Eastern China, the EastChina Bureau was in charge of the work of Anhui, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, Zhejiang, Jiangxi and Shanghai. Ithad far greater power than that of anylocal authority in the six provinces and Shanghai. On the eve of the CR,WenWenbowas the head of thisBureau.Han Zheyi was one of the secretaries of the East ChinaBureau.22HanZheyi,“The Anting Incident that IExperienced”(Wo suo qinli de anting shijian),inDang'an chunqiu(ChronicleofArchives),p.3,No.1,2005.23See“RebelWorkers andtheChineseHumanRightMovements:InterviewwithPanGuoping,aFormerLeadingOfficialofShanghaiWorkers GeneralHeadquarters"(Gongrenzaofan paiyuzhongguorenquan yundong:fangyuanShanghai gong zong sifuzerenPan Guoping),in Supplement to China News Digest (Huaxia wenzhaizengkan),No.99,1996.According to the WGH,more than 40,000 workers attended the inauguration of theWGH.See Anting fengbao: Shanghai gongren geming zaofan zong silingbu douzhengshi zhiyi (Anting Storm: TheStruggleHistoryof theShanghaiWorkers'RevolutionaryRebel GeneralHeadquartersI),inGongrenzaofanbao(Workers'Rebel News),May19,1967.

253which was to become veryinfluential laterin Shanghai. Organizers had expected over1,000 workers to be present at the founding ceremony, but more than 30,000 workersfrom over 470 factories all over the city attended.24 This was totally against theShanghai authorities’ wish. During the course of the ceremony, the Shanghaiauthorities received live reports relayed by a bugging system that had been installed inthe ceremony platform, and they retrieved and reviewed the records of every organizerAt the ceremony, many rebel workers spoke out and condemned persecutionscommitted by power-holders. Workers from the Loading and Unloading MachineryRepair Plant of the Shanghai Railway Bureau even presented confiscated lethalweapons and blood-stained clothes, demonstrating atrocities inflicted by people whohad been influenced by the Shanghai authorities. All this astonishing evidence madethe workers'blood boil. The newly-formed WGH set out its “Manifesto of theShanghai Workers'Revolutionary Rebel General Headquarters", claiming that:

We will vehemently rebel against the capitalist reactionarylinevehemently rebel against the capitalist roaders in the Party, andvehemently rebel against all ghosts and monsters!We will seize power,that is, take back people's power from the capitalist roaders in theParty and hold it firmly in hands of the proletariat. We will ferret outall the Krushchevian revisionists who are trying to usurp the supremepower of theParty and the army. None of them will escape punishment!We will struggle till they are stinking, falling and crumbling to dust,and then trample on them to ensure that they would never be able toturnover!25

The rally was a great success. For the first time after 1949, the Shanghai24Ibid.23From Shanghai gongzongsi xuexicailiao(TheStudy Materials ftheShanghaiWGH), printedbyWGHShanghai,1967.

254workers cried out the slogan of“power seizure". It was also the first workersmanifesto claiming“power seizure” since the outbreak of the CR in the entire countryFor the Shanghai authorities, this was a bold offensive from the rebels who wereclearly attempting to overthrow the political status quo, to seize power frompower-holders in the Shanghai Party. For the workers, however, it was more aboutverbally expressing a political stance in response to the call of power seizure from theMaoist leadership than a planned agenda for certain actions to be carried out. In fact,most workers held the party authorities in awe and had enormous respect for themowing to great achievements the Party had been making since its birth. How could aworker dare or even imagine seizing power from the great and glorious Party?

Right after the founding of the WGH, more than 20,000 workers held ademonstration and proceeded to the city hall with a petition. In a cold winter rain,workers demanded that Mayor Cao should receive them before 22:30 pm. Yet whatfollowed angered workers even more. Mayor Cao sent a staff after the deadline passed.informing theworkers that they shouldleave thecityhall and themayorwould seethem at another place, the Friendship Theater. Without having any food for nearly awhole day,the workers agreed towalkto the theater.But theywere cheated againAfter waiting at the Friendship Theater for another 3 hours, the workers found notrace of the mayor. At 2 o'clock in the morning, the Shanghai authorities sent thechairperson of Shanghai General Workers' Union, a colleague of the work team leaderShi Huizhen at Wang Hongwen's factory, to the Friendship Theater. This messengerclaimed that therewas never such an organization as theWGH in theSixteen-poini

255Program, thus making the attitudes of the Shanghai authorities crystal clear that theWGHwasillegalandneededtobedisbandedimmediately.Atthispoint,apropaganda vehicle outside the theater broadcasted a so-called “telegram fromBeijing"(later revealed as a rumor) saying that “Premier Zhou stated: “if the ShanghaiMunicipal Committee doesn't want to see you, come to Beijing; I will see you!'"Infuriated with the messenger's comments on theWGH and emboldened by the"'telegram from Beijing", assembled rebel workers were determined to go to Beijingto present their case and make an appeal directly to the Maoist leadership against thesuppression they were suffering. Without any hesitation, a great number of rebelsrushed to the Shanghai railway station.26

Confronted with so many rebel workers inflamed with anger, the Shanghaiauthorities agreed, but only verbally, to arrange trains to transfer workers to Beijing.Yet their actual plan was to disperse the assembled workers to different locations bytrain so as to play a game of “divide and conquer”with the rebels. The first colony ofrebel workers got on a Beijing-bound train,butvery soon, theShanghai authoritiescontacted the authorities of Nanjing, a city not far from Shanghai, to stop the trainThe second express trainwithtwo thousand rebel workers and someRed Guards onboard steamed out of Shanghai to Beijing at 7 o'clock on the morning of November10. But soon, it was converted to a slow train on orders from Shanghai authorities.and its speed was reduced from 90 to 20 kilometers per hour. Finally, after about one26 See “Rebel Workers and the Chinese Human Right Movements: Interview with Pan Guoping, a Former LeadingOfficial of ShanghaiWorkers General Headquarters”(Gongren zaofan pai yu zhongguo renquan yundong: fangyuanShanghai gongzong sifuzerenPan Guoping),in Supplement to China News Digest(Huaxia wenzhaizengkan),No.99,1996.

256hour, this train stopped at Anting station in the suburbs of Shanghai. The third train,packed with rebel workers, was scheduled to leave at 10:10 a.m., but never left theplatform. The petitioning workers were thus successfully dispersed by the Shanghaiauthorities into three different places: Shanghai, Anting and Nanjing. For the workers.thiswas abrutaldeception.

Anting station was located in a desolate small town. Under the Shanghaiauthorities’ arrangement, a large number of local cadres, work team members andloyalist workers soon arrived there to stimulate “debates"with the hungry andexhausted rebel workers.Yetinmostcases,what characterized these“debates"weremerelyviolent streams of abuse,wantonlylabeling therebels"counter-revolutionaries", “political pickpockets", “saboteurs of production" or“anarchists", and so forth. To further demoralize the rebels, family members of theseworkerswere transported there totrytopersuade their relativestogiveup theirrebelactions. In addition, many undercover cops mixed in with the crowd, spying on rebelworkers and students. As there was virtually no preparation for this trip, after the trainhad gotten stuck at Anting station for more than three days and three nights, the rebels.mostof themwithouta singlecentwiththem,hadtoendurehunger,coldweatherlack of sleep and crowded conditions. Many fainted due to hunger and hypertension inand outside of thepacked train cars.Due to a shortage of medicinefor the sickworkers went tolocal towns to obtain medicine.But after getting orders fromShanghai, local cadres refused the rebels the much-needed medicine. Because ofillness contracted at Anting,onefemale rebel worker even passed awaylater in

257Shanghai.

When theShanghai authorities realized that they could not starve therebelsintosubmisson,they shipped“one thousand and fivehundredloaves of bread"toAnting.27 But the cadres in charge of bread distribution required people to registerwith employee cards for food. Therefore, many workers were reluctant to obtain foodunder such a condition, for fear of being retaliated later. Some rebels even preferred tosell their cherished watches to buy food from local stores and share this with others.In fact, according to information disclosed later, the Shanghai authorities had beencollecting “black files” since the founding ceremony of the Shanghai WGH. Of the 16foundingleaders of theWGH, threeof themhadbeenprivatelysentencedto thedeathpenalty,threetolifeimprisonment,and othershadsetterms ofimprisonment.And theauthorities had even already decided on the execution ground and localities of prisonhouses.288Upon learning of the situation of the rebels at Anting, three thousand rebelworkers and many Red Guardswalked from Shanghai to Anting to come to the rescueof the rebel workers.Bringing large amount of food and medicine with them, after27 See the pamphlet “Comments on the Capitalist Reactionary Line of the Shanghai Municipal Commitee"(PingShanghaishiweidezichanjiejifandongluxian),publishedinShanghaibytheRedRebelUnifiedArmy of theNewBeijingUniversity and theRedGuardRevolutionaryCommitteeof theNewBeijingUniversityStationedinShanghai, December, 1966,from http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=4490, cited July 3, 2009.28See ZhangBaolin,“A Summary of Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Workers'Struggle"(Shanghai gongrengeming zaofan pai douzheng gaishu),in January Storm,No.4.See also Zhou Guoting,““Death Penalty'Can NotThreaten Our RebelWorkers at All(Panchu sixing xia bu liao women gongren zaofan pai),in January Storm,No.2.As a matter of fact,there were precedents of the execution of common workers by old bureaucrats in1966in the first wave of the CR manipulated by Liu-Dengists. At Wuhan Steel Works,Hubei, it was disclosed in abig-character posterby anotherloyalistworkerHuangLiansheng thatPangYulai hadhid thefact that hewasraised by a capitalist family before the Liberation. Believing that he was just a common worker and should not bethe target of the ongoing CR,PangYulai tore off the poster and then quarreled with Huang and his supporters.Inthe mess, Pang picked up a piece of stone to hit Huang yet missed, and the stone landed on an onlooker's head andinjured him. This small incident was regarded by the Wang Renzhong-led Hubei authority as acounter-revolutionary case and after a huge rally15 days later onJuly 5,1966,Pang Yulai was executed.Irritated,many common people inWuhan turned intorebels.SeeCao,Chengyi,Recollecting theCulturalRevolution in aSorrow-Joy Mixed Emotion (Beijin jiaoji hua wenge).Hong Kong: Zhongguo wenhua chuanbo chubanshe (ChinaCultural CommunicationPress),2010.Cao Chengyi was a former leader of theXinYi Ye RevolutionaryRebelsHeadquartersinWuhan.

258one night of walking, this rescue parade finally joined the spirited workers at Anting

But both sides were locked in a stalemate. The rebels decided to take a longshot gamble. Led by Pan Guoping, Huang Jinhai and other rebel leaders, severalhundred rebels stopped a train running on the tracks of a major north-south railwaypassage. Since there was only one track at Anting, this move effectively blocked alltrains from passing through Anting station, including the No. 14 International Expresswith many foreigners on board. The rebels'move shocked the authorities of Shanghaiand the CCP East China Bureau. An urgent telegram was sent to Beijing. At that time.the State Council headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and the CCRG headed by Chen Bodawere in charge of the everyday state of affairs. Entrusted by Zhou Enlai, Chen Bodasent back a telegram in response, which was a disadvantage for the rebels. Part of itread:

I hear that a lot of Shanghai workers wanted to come to Pekingand that they have since occupied the Anting East railway station.When the situation was explained to them, many went home of theirown accord. This is very good; this is the correct thing to do. I hearthere areothers,however,whorefusetoleavethestation.

Now, I understand their enthusiasm in wanting to come toPeking. It is right for them to join in the Cultural Revolution.But theymust alsofollow theinstructionsof ChairmanMao and theCentralCommittee. There are two principles involved here, and the minor onemust be subordinated to the major one. As workers, their main job is towork. Joining in the Revolution is only secondary. They must thereforego back to work. They can take part in the Revolution outside workinghours. They should go back immediately. It is a serious matter to

disobeyPartyinstructions.29NealeHunter, ShanghaiJoural: AnEyewitess Account ofthe Cultural Revolution, pp.139-140,NewYrk:Praeger,1969

259

BesidesChenBoda,TaoZhu,anotherseniorcadreintheCenterwhowasincharge of everyday state affairs and a leading member of the CCRG called theShanghai Party Committee as well, expressing similar views toward the AntingIncident, decrying the workers’ action in going to Beijing. But what really matteredhere was not whether rebels violated rules of production or disobeyed Partyinstructions. Rather, it was whether or not rebel workers could form their owncity-wide organizations as the Red Guards had, and involve themselves in themovement duringwork time.The Red Guard had already turned the whole nationupside down. It was very hard for the authorities to take control of the Red Guardmovement, let alone the workers' organizations. Set against this background, it was nowonderthatthepower-holdersatvariouslevelswerereluctanttoallowworkerstoform their own independent organizations. The feeling of resistance to massmovements was vividly embodied in Liu Shaoqi, the state chair, who said: “You askme how to make the CR. To be frank, I don't know."30 Yet the Shanghai party'srefusal of recognition compelled the rebels ofWGH to go to the Center inBeijing forrecognition.

UponreceivingChenBoda'stelegram,theShanghaiauthoritiesimmediatelysent a delegation to Anting the night of November 10, which consisted of Han Zheyi(a secretary of CCP Eastern China Bureau), Li Gancheng (a vice-mayor), and YangKai (a vice minister of the Propaganda Department of CCP Eastern China Bureau).Negotiations between the delegation and rebels lasted several hours untill midnight.30 Liu Shaoqi's Address at the Meeting of Cultural Revolution Activists Among Revolutionary Teachers AndStudentsInBeijing,July29,1966,

260yetremainedfruitless.HavingbeenrepeatedlycheatedbytheShanghai authorities,the rebels were suspicious about the authenticity of Chen Boda's telegram since it wasjust a copy, not the original. Moreover, they were dissatisfied with Chen's call forthem to return to their jobs without any mention of their demands, especially the issueof the legal status of the WGH. For them, gaining official recognition for the WGH asa "revolutionary organization”was the bottomline.According toHanZhenyi'srecollection, a bone of contention was that the rebels insisted that they had the right tomake revolution during working hours. Han Zheyi and other cadres stated that theycouldnotmakethefinaldecisionabouttherebels'demandswithouttheauthorizationof the Center.With the excuse that therewas noway to contact theCenter from such aremote railway station, the delegation led by Han left for Shanghai.31 While thewhole railway system of Eastern China got snarled up, more and more angry rebelssettled in Antingfor a possible siege.Someworkers even prepared towalk more thanone thousandkilometers toBeijing topetition to theCenter

It was Zhang Chunqiao, the deputy leader of the CCRG and a deputy secretaryof the Shanghai Party Committee, who broke this deadlock. On November 11, after adiscussion among major leaders such as Zhou Enlai,ChenBoda,and Tao Zhu,theCenter entrusted Zhang Chunqiao to handle this event and sent him toShanghai by amilitary airplane. The next morning, in the heavy rain, Zhang Chunqiao appeared atAnting, standing in a truck and making speeches to the rebels through a loudspeaker.Regardless of the rain, rebels stepped out, speaking against the Shanghai Municipal31 Han Zheyi,“*The Anting Accident that IExperienced" (Wo suo qinli de Anting shijan), in Dang'an chunqiu,p.5,No.1,2005.

261Committee in the face of Zhang Chunqiao one after another. During a nine-hourmeeting, they appealed again and again to Zhang for the recognition of the WGH.Zhang Chunqiao carefully listened to the workers'accusations and explained to themthe complex relationship between “grasping revolution" and “promoting production".Zhang promised the rebels that he would report their grievances and sufferingsinflicted by the Shanghai authorities to Chairman Mao and the CCRG and a solutionwould be worked out once the rebels returned to Shanghai. Furthermore, Zhangagreed that the workers could send representatives to Beijing. Upon the demands ofthe workers, Zhang verbally recognized the WGH as a "revolutionary organization'and expressed his personal support. Rebel worker leaders, such as Pan Guopingpromised to bring the workers back to Shanghai.But until theWGH was to receiverecognition from the government, the leaders insisted that they would not disperse andreturnhome.Theydemanded awrittenstatementfromthegovernment thatrecognized their organization. However, after those nearly 1o,o00 rebels at Antingreturned to Shanghai, all other Shanghai Party leaders refused to recognize the WGHTo the astonishment of Shanghai's officials, Zhang Chunqiao held a mass meeting inthe Culture Plaza of Shanghai on November 13, 1966 with the rebels from the Antingbattle and formally signed five points that the rebels had demanded. It read:

1. Recognition of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel GeneralHeadquarters as a revolutionary and legitimate organization;

2. Recognition of the November 9 inauguration and forced trek to Beijing as aform of revolutionary action; (for similar cases in the future, workers should sendtheirrepresentativesinstead.)

3.Attribution of all responsibilityfor the consequences of the AntingIncident

262to theEast China Bureau and theShanghaiParty Committee;

4.Public self-criticism of CaoDiqiu;5. Provision of various sorts of aid to the WGH to facilitate its future work.32

Regardless of Zhang Chunqiao's verbal promise to support the rebels, some474 workers insisted on going to Beijing on foot from Anting, wanting “to have aword with Chen Boda about his *repressive telegram'". Together with Mayor CaoDiqiu, Zhang left Shanghai again for Suzhou, where the defiant rebels departing fromAnting had lodged. Led by Geng Jinzhang, the worker representatives presentedZhang and Cao with another set of five demands. Differing from Zhang's attitude ofsigning again, Mayor Cao was appalled and felt betrayed, as he had thought that theirtaskwas merely topersuade the 474workers to gobacktoShanghai.After fiercelyarguing with Zhang Chunqiao for two hours, Cao gave in and signed."? For the rebels,Mayor Cao's signature signaled that not only the Center and the CCRG were on theirside, but also the Shanghai Party Committee conferred them legal status

Today, it is still not clear whether or not Mao himself authorized ZhangChunqiao to recognize the WGH or gave Zhang a bottom line before he left forAnting. What we do know, however, is that before Zhang's departure, some regulanPolitburo members of the CCP had talked to him, and suggested that he should notagree with the workers'demands, and all he needed to do was to calm down the rebelsand persuade them to go back to work. According to what Zhang confided to hiscolleagues later, his support of the rebels and approval of the WGH risked ^having hishead chopped off', and his only protection was the article of “freedom of assembly32 The English translation was modified from Elizabeth Perry & Li Xun, Proletarian Power: Shanghai in TheCulturalRevolution,p.35,Boulder,CO:WestviewPress,1997.33Neale Hunter,1969,p.143.

263and association"in the Constitution. When an enlarged meeting was held in Mao'sstudy in Beijing to discuss Zhang Chunqiao's action, Tao Zhu, who ranked fifthamong thePartyleaders at that time,assailed Zhang's decision with a Chinesesaying— “chopping off the heads first and memorialize later", which means actingfirst and reporting afterwards.?4 That was a serious accusation to Zhang, because avery strict system of party discipline had been enforced on the basis of Liu Shaoqi'spolitical treatiseHow tobe a Good Communist before theCR.If onedisobeyed theinstructions from the superior, one could be labeled as"anti-party", or even as“counter-revolutionary". Nonetheless, Mao lent his full support to Zhang and stated:"'you can chop off their heads first and memorialize later.'35 Facts always come first,then concepts." As clarified by Mao later, “If there are no facts, how could conceptsform? If there is no practice, where is theory? Sometimes theory and practice runparallel, sometimes theory comes first, but practice is decisive and the most importantIfworkersdidn't makerevolutionfirst,howcomewewere abletomakesomerulesfor it?"36

ZhangChunqiao's audacious initiativein dealingwith theAntingincidentwonhim thereputationforfullysupportingtheCRaswell astherebelworkers'trustwhich paved the way for Zhang and his comrades to influence the movements in34 See “Rebel Workers and the Chinese Human Right Movements: Interview with Pan Guoping, a former leadingofficial ofShanghaiWorkers GeneralHeadquarters”(Gongrenzaofanpaiyuzhongguorenquanyundong:fangyuan Shanghai gong zong sifuzerenPan Guoping),in Supplement to China NewsDigest(Huaxia wenzhaizengkan),No.99,1996.Elizabeth Perry & Li Xun, 1997, p.36.

264Shanghai in the coming years. Similarly, rebel leaders, such as Wang Hongwen, PanGuoping, Huang Jinhai, among others, became well known in Shanghai because ofthe Anting battle and the workers' struggle gaining recognition for the WGH. Thehistorical significance of the Anting incident layin the fact that it signaled awatershed moment in the CR. From then on, workers, superseding students, emergedasakeyplayerintheCR.Withtheendorsementof theWGHbytheMaoistleadership, the political landscape of the Cultural Revolution—both in Shanghai andin the entire country—changed profoundly. In the following months, the WGH was todeal a deadly blow and make possible a great political experiment—the ShanghaiPeople's Commune—emulating the Paris Commune nearly one hundred years earlier.

Bureaucratized Strikes and the Spate of Economism37

After the Anting Incident, on Nov. 24, the SPC convened an enlarged meetingto discuss the volatile situation in Shanghai. At the meeting, Zhang Chunqiao was37 Economism was first introduced into Marxist discourse by Lenin.At the beginning of the 20th century, Leninharshly criticized the so-called“economists”in the Russian Marxist movement.According toLenin,the result ofthe economism was“to obscure the class character of the struggle of the working class,weaken this struggle by ameaningless‘recognitionofsociety'andreducerevolutionaryMarxismtoa trivialreformist trend".WhileLeninactivelyadvocated creating a revolutionary workers’party,theRussian economistsfavored“assistance to theeconomic struggleof theproletariat".(SeeDuncanHallas,Controversy:Whatis‘economism'?,InternationalSocialism (1st series),No.56,March 1973,pp.18-19.)During theMao era,economism mainly referred to puttingeconomics,rather than politics in command.""GuangmingRibao”onJanuary17,1967commented that"Economism leads people astray, causing them to pay attention only to immediate, partial interests, while ignoringthe fundamental interests of the proletariat. It is against Marxism-Leninism, against Mao Tse-tung's thought, and isout-and-out counter-revolutionary revisionist stuff."Mao's quotations about opposing economism were alsopublished in the paper.Mao's main points were summarized as the following: 1.Politics is the supreme commander,the soul. Political work is the life-blood of all economic work. 2. We should put the greatest efforts into politicalstruggle.In the absence of political reforms all the productive forces are beingruined.3.We should not see merelythe immediate and partial interests of the working class while forgetting its broad,long-range interests.4.Bevigilant against attackby“sugar-coated bullets."(SeeQuotationsFrom ChairmanMaoTse-tungOnOpposingEconomism,the English translation appeared in Peking Review, Vol.10, No.5, Jan.27,1967,pp.5-6.）Accordingto ElisabethPerry and Li Xun,some organizations were dubbed"economistic"in the January Storm of Shanghaibecause of "their relative disinterest in the political debates of the day; they were not centrally concerned with theissue of attacking ordefendingpartyleaders.Theirfocuswas directedinstead onredressingsocioeconomicgrievances."(SeePerry and Li,1997p.97)

265under heavy attack from other high ranking SPC cadres. One accusation towardZhang was that his approval of the WGH's demands could undermine productionDeputy Mayor Song Jiwen explicitly threatened Zhang with economic statisticspertaining to production in Shanghai. He said, “Now we should prepare for the mostdifficult situation. There are many kinds of disorder: minor, medium and major ones.Minor disorder appears now and production is affected 10 percent; a medium disorderwould have greater influence [on production]; as for a major disorder, it would havean impact on people's lives. And the situation will be paralyzed. Under the sun, youare afraid or not afraid [of the disorder]? If you are not afraid, we are not afraid either.Just let the disorder develop." Zhang Chengzong, another deputy mayor, alsocomplained that the WGH's demands, which Zhang Chunqiao had signed, influencedproduction. He said that people should certainly prepare for the utmost chaos inShanghai. At the meeting, Zhang Chunqiao rebuffed them by stating that it was notthe WGH that had caused Shanghai's disorder; rather, the WGH had come intoexistence precisely because of the previous disorder in Shanghai. Zhang maintainedthat he had acted in accordance with the state's Constitution in recognizing the WGHMoreover, whether to recognize a workers’ organization was an indication of one'sattitude toward the masses.38 To some degree, Song Jiwen's phrasing “let the disorderdevelop' was an early reflection of the SPC's wish to use an economic weapon toattain apolitical aim.

Thereafter, several incidents heightened conflicts and intensified confrontation38Shanghai shiweibapaokou duizhunwuchanjejisilingbude taotianzuixing (TheSPC'sToweringCrimetoSetthe Cannon onto theProletarianHeadquarters),in Zhibu shenghuo(LifeinPartyBranches),Nos.2-3(Combinedissue),Jan17,1967.Ed.by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Zhibu shenghuo,Shanghai.pp.31-32.

266between the rebel workers and students and the Shanghai authorities. As Shanghaientered into a turbulent stage of the Cultural Revolution in the wake of the Antingbattle, the SPC reacted by organizing a city-wide loyalist workers’ faction to counterthe WGH and protect the establishment. As early as the beginning stage of rebelworkers’ movement, noted by Shanghai Trade Union chair Zhang Qi, "Chen Pixianand Cao Diqiu?" thought up a way to organize the ‘majority faction' to counter them.'And they provided tacit yet crucial support to conservative workers' organizations insome factories.*° Apparently, the Shanghai Party needed a larger loyalist workersorganization to prepare for the coming storm. Right after the Anting battle, thefrustrated Shanghai authorities were busy building a city-wide conservative workers?organization which would take a pro-SPC stance. Meeting with more than 500workers on November 19, Cao Diqiu attacked the WGH as ^impure"(meaning thatwithin the WGH there were many anti-communists),and he lent his support only tothose who rebel against bourgeoisie. As soon as Zhang Chunqiao left Shanghai forBeijing to report the outcome of the Anting Incident on November 24, 1966, MayorCao Diqiu was too impatient to wait. In sharp contrast to his insistence on evadingrepresentativesfrom theWGHjust afewdaysearlier,onNovember 24,hegladlyreceived more than one hundred worker representatives from 38 factories of Shanghaiwho were preparing to form the loyalist "Scarlet Guards" to protect the establishmentDuring the meeting, Mayor Cao suggested setting up a preparatory committee andpromised that the Shanghai Party would send key figures to attend its inauguration39 Chen Pixian was the first secretary of Shanghai Party Commitee and Cao Diqiu was the mayor of Shanghai atthetime40Elisabeth Perry and Li Xun, 1997, pp.80-81.

267Theproposed“Scarlet Guards"organization was entrusted to the Shanghai GeneralWorkers' Union (Shanghai zong gonghui). The next day, Mayor Cao talked with therepresentatives again, claiming that it had just been a tactic and temporary measurefor the Shanghai Party to recognize the WGH, and that the way that Zhang Chunqiaohad dealt with the Anting Incident was absolutely wrong.4 In addition, Cao evenencouraged the representatives to seize Zhang Chunqiao and send him back toShanghai to make self-criticism.42

The organizational power of the conservativeworkers inShanghaiwasfirstpresented and tested to in the famous Liberation Daily battle. Liberation Daily, as oneof the two major party organs in Shanghai, was understandably reluctant to coverrebel news.Partly out of envyfor the rebelworkers'great success in theAntingbattlea group of Red Guards in Shanghai, led by the largest rebel student organization, theRed Guards' Revolutionary Committee of the Colleges and Universities of Shanghai(Red Revolutionaries in short),43 surprised Shanghai citizens on the last day ofNovember 1966 by occupying the building of the Libration Daily. Their aim was notto seize the Liberation Daily from the Party. Rather, they demanded their own tabloid“Red GuardBattleNews"tobejointlydistributedwiththeLiberationDailythroughthe newspaper distribution office in the Postal Department under the charge of the41CaoDiqiu shigongrenchiweiduidehoutailaobanCaoDiqiuistheWire-pullingMasterBehindWorkersScarlet Guards),in Zhibu shenghuo(Life inParty Branches),Nos.2-3(Combined issue),Jan17,1967.Ed.by theRevolutionaryRebelHeadquarters of Zhibushenghuo,Shanghai.pp.46-47.42Yan,Jiaqi,Gao,Gao,TheTen-Year History of the Chinese CulturalRevolution,translated and publishedbyInstitute of Current ChinaStudies of Taiwan,1988,p.381.43 The Red Revolutionaries,which included college students and high school students,was said to have fortythousandmembers at thebeginning of February,1967.See the pamphletYihonggehui mouxiefuzerenwei daibiaodepaodazhongyangwenge defandong niliu jiyao(A Summary of theReactionary Countercurrent of BombardingtheCCRGRepresentedbySomeRedRevolutionaries'ResponsiblePersons),Ed.byTheRevolutionaryRebelLiaisonCentre of Organizations of theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,March1967.p.24.

268Shanghai Party.TheWGH intervened immediately, suggesting that students shoulddemand a self-criticism from the Liberation Daily for following a “capitalistreactionary line". This idea was adopted by the students. Soon after the occupationhundreds of thousands of loyalist workers and Shanghai citizens rushed to theLiberationDaily tobesiege the occupiers. Many students wereinjured in repeatedwaves of attacks from pro-party people. Workers from the WGH were dispatched tothe LiberationDaily to come to the rescue.On the early morning of December 3,theWGH workers in the Liberation Daily building gathered all occupiers for a meeting.All attendants agreed with the WGH's suggestion of forming a "FrontlineHeadquarters", which was given a free hand to direct the battle. In later confrontations,similar "Frontline Headquarters" organized by workers became a model of runningvarious businesses abandoned by the Shanghai authorities. On December 5, after ninedays seige on the rebel students, the Shanghai authorities surrendered, signing all thedemandsproposedbytheRedRevolutionaries

In this battle, although rebel workers of the WGH and students fought togetherand triumphed over the Shanghai authorities, they diverged on the question ofwhether to use this incident as a springboard to pull down the still strong Shanghaiauthorities. Seeds of inauspicious dissensions was sown among them. Claiming tosecuretheShanghai authorities tokeep theirword,a smallgroupof studenthardlinersguarded the building as a fortress and set up another “Fighting to the Bitter EndHeadquarters"to call for “fighting to death in the Liberation Daily building."Thiswas strategicallyunwise sincetherebelsgot most ofwhat theyhad originallywanted

269when the authorities capitulated to their demands. If the rebels were not strong enoughto make the authorities keep their promise outside the building, it was unlikely thatthey could do this by "fighting to the death" within the prison house-like fortress.Criticized by most occupiers and the “"Frontline Headquarters" in the building, thehardliners had to give up their plan to avoid more bloodshed. Nonetheless, theshowdownbetweenrebelsandauthorities attheLiberationDailydemonstratedonceagain the powerful strength of the rebel students and workers, especially when therebels united. Possibly intending to buy off the workers and cast in a bone betweenworkers and students, the Shanghai authorities suggested in the final round ofnegotiations giving allrebelworkers involvedin theLiberationDailyIncident aPLAmilitary uniform - which at that time was rare, fashionable and honorable amongcivilians. The WGH unequivocally refused this offer which was later seen as one ofthefirst attempts by the old Shanghai authorities to use economism tobuy offworkersfor their own political purposes.4

One direct outcome of theLiberationDailysiegewas thatit polarized anddifferentiated workers with divergent political positions. And this motivated andacceleratedtheformationofthecity-wideconservativeworkers’"ScarletGuards",which absorbed many existing smaller conservative workers’organizations andgreatly expanded. It was in this incident that the Scarlet Guards gathered momentumand strength and emerged as the main opponent of the WGH, even greatlyoutnumberingtherebels.Toinvestinand control theconservativeworkers,the4See"TheLiberationDaily Incident that Shakes theWhole Country", inWorkers'Rebel News (Gongren zaofanbao),edited by theShanghaiWGH,June 1,1967.

270Shanghai Party endowed them with substantial material assistance. Zhang Qi, memberof the Shanghai CCP Standing Committee and chair of the Shanghai Trade Union.said bluntly, “The union has so much money, now is the time to use a little." In sharpcontrast to their disregard toward and non-recognition of the WGH, the Shanghaiauthorities were more than happy to offer the Scarlet Guards 125,000 identifyingarmbands within a short time.*Roughly at the end of the Liberation Daily Incident.on December 6, just one month after the WGH's foundation, the official inaugurationof the Scarlet Guards with more than 200,000 members was held at the People's Plaza.Immediately after the inauguration, the Scarlet Guards dispatched a huge contingentto protest against the rebels and the Shanghai party's “capitulation" (to the rebels) and"betrayal' outside the Liberation Daily building. When the rebels retreated from thebuilding after the authorities met their demands,many of them were beaten up byScarlet Guardsmemberswaitingoutside.For therest of December after theLiberationDailysiege,waves of civil unrest broke out throughout the city.Theopposing camps-the WGH and the Scarlet Guards—waged a propaganda waragainst each other. The ensuing skirmishes burst out here and there. Both camps triedtheir best to rally supporters from all sources.With skillful mobilization by Partybranch secretaries, heads of unions, and factory managers, in mid-December, theScarlet Guards organization reached its climax and emerged as a gigantic group with amembershipof nearlyonemillion

Nonetheless, the Scarlet Guards began to decline when the overall political45 Perry and Li Xun 1997, p.81.

271atmospherewas nolongerfavorable,as therebelsgrewstronger and stronger throughrecruiting more underprivileged people, such as contract and temporary workers. Withthe backing of the Maoist leadership in the CCRG, rebel students in Beijing UniversityQinghua University and the Third Red Guard Headquarters of Beijing eventuallygained upper hand in struggles against loyalist, conservative students. They couldthen exert greater influence on the CR in Shanghai through their liaison posts in thecity. On Dec. 11, Mao called for “winning new victories" to all the rebels throughoutthe country. The same day, the Shanghai rebels held a huge rally under the slogan“Making Headway against the New Counter-offensive of the Bourgeois ReactionaryLine of the Municipal Committee” with an impressive attendance of six hundredthousand. Three days later, the WGH and 18 other organizations convened a “jointmeeting" (lianxi huiyi), at which they demanded that the Shanghai MunicipalCommittee and its cadres at all levels support the rebels; that no public self-criticismby the Shanghai Municipal Committee and its cadres at all levels could be madewithout permission from the rebels; that methods and timing for public self-criticismof all cadres had to be decided by the rebels. The organizational format of the “jointmeeting”,accordingtoalaterofficialnarrativeof theWGH,signaledthebeginning ofa great alliance by all proletarian revolutionary organizations in Shanghai and alsopaved the wayfor the preparatory establishment of proletarian power.46

The rebel forces were further strengthened when the literati rebels joined in46 See Workers'Rebel News (Gongren zaofan bao),edited by the Shanghai WGH, January 12, 1968.Facing thegrowing strength of the rebels,theShanghai Municipal Committeebecame inclined tobe two-faced in theirattitudes toward rebels and conservative workers,making self-criticism and declaring support while attendingrallies of both sides. These demands targeted this inclination and attempted to stop hedging.

272Helped and prompted by Zhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuan, both members of theCCRG, the Writers' Group of the Shanghai Municipal Committee announced its“collective rebellion" and its independence from the Shanghai Party. Viewed as “abombshell exploded in the backyard of the Cao (Diqiu) family” at that time, this dealta heavy blow to the Shanghai authorities because theWriters' Group had functionecas the insider source of information for the Shanghai Party. On Dec. 18, theRevolutionary Rebel Liaison Centre of Organizations of the Shanghai MunicipalParty Committee (jilianzhan for short), with the Writers' Group as its core, conveneda big rally to “hold high the red flag of Mao Zedong's thought and strafe thebourgeois reactionary line of the old Municipal Committee", at which Mayor Cao andhis senior Chen Pixian, the first secretary of SPC were forced to stand on a table,lowering their heads to make public self-criticism. Obviously, the tide was runningagainst the old Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Scarlet Guards they supported.

Out of a strong will for political survival, cadres at all levels of the ShanghaiParty acted rapidly and efficiently. They used all the resources that were available tocheck the movement, among which the most handy and effective tool was money,since the economic system,such as banks and treasury departments at all unitsremained intact, and seals for authorizing money distribution were still under theircontrol. The role of the bureaucrats in creating a so-called “wind of economism'blowing in the last days of 1966 and the first days of 1967 would be decisive. For theShanghai authorities, on the one hand, they could use money to buy off workers fo1exchanging political support, or, at least, compromises. A money deluge, on the other

273hand,could be a practical and powerful tool to exert enormouspressure on theMaoistleadership which was in support of the rebels.47

For those rebels who struggled merely for economic rights, there did existmany inequalities and semi-exploitative arrangements in the pre-CR labor systemsuch as temporary laborers, contract laborers and sub-contract laborers. Based onenormous sufferings from inequalities they had experienced, those economicallyunderprivileged laborers had solid reasons for requesting compensation and laborreforms from the authorities.When those rebels'need of money and promotions metwith the cadres' willingness to give away money and material benefits to shake offpolitical attacks,itwasinevitablethattherewouldbeafinancialexodusfrom thestaterun enterprises and banks to economically underprivileged laborers and other people.suchasthosetravellingtoothercitiesto“exchangerevolutionaryexperiences"or“lodgecomplaints"

Specifically, the wind of economism was mainly embodied in the followingphenomena:1.Wage compensation and promotion of the wage level.People who feltinadequately paid would ask for wage compensation and promotion from the powerholders. 2. Workers’exchange of revolutionary experiences (chuanlian). Students andteachers'chuanlian was initially advocated byMao and pro-CR leaders as it helpedthe launch and development of the CR. Millions of Red Guards, paid by the state.47 Some rebel workers in Qiuxin Dockyard surmised two other purposes behind the power holdersblowing of thewind of the economism.Firstly,in so doing,they could shift the main direction of political struggle.Secondly,psychologically feeling that they could not act as“officials"for too long,the power holders intentionallycommitted retaliatory sabotage against the national economy,thus creating havoc within the whole country.SeeJinggenMaozhuxi,chedinaogeming:Qiuxinzaochuanchangbufenzhonglaoniangongrenzuotanjiyao(FollowingChairmanMao,MakingRevolutiontotheEnd:TheSummaryofaSymposiumofSomeMiddle-agedand OldWorkers inQiuxinDockyard),inWorker'sRebel News(Gongrenzaofanbao),No.3,Jan.14,1967.

274travelledalloverthecountrytomakerevolution.Afterthreemonths'chuanlian,theCCPleadershipfound that thenational transportationsystemwasoverburdenedbyfree riders. Moreover, it was a heavy burden to the national economy. Therefore, theMaoist leaders called for exchanging revolutionary experiences on foot.48 But as withthe rise of the workers’ movement, a lot of workers who insisted on “exchange ofrevolutionary experiences" by train, ship and bus would ask the local power holdersfor travel expenses, which caused major economic problems for their work units.Moreseriously,unlike students and teachers,workers’walkingout ofworkgravelyinfluenced production and the economy. 3. Housing occupations. People with housingdifficulties would forcefully occupy state's or former capitalists' houses. 4. Change ofworkers’ status.A large number of contract workers, sub-contract workers, temporaryworkers, and apprentice workers demanded to be treated as full time workers. 5.Enhancementofwelfare.Workersdemandedmorewelfaresuch asinsurance,retirement pension,etc.6.Change of factories’status.Since wage and welfare instate-runenterprises underthe ownershipby thewholepeoplewasbetter thanenterprises under collective ownership,many neighborhood factories,lane productionteams andothersmallfactoriespetitionedtomerge theirsmallunitsintobigger48 The CCP Central Committe and the State Council decided on November 16, 1966 that as from November 21,1966 and until April1967,all the revolutionary teachers and students and Red Guards in institutes of higherlearning,army academies and schools andintermediate schools shall stop coming toPeking and otherlocalities bytrain,ship,and busfor exchanging revolutionary experiences,and the Central Committee and theState Councildecided on Dec.1,1966 that as from December 21 the teachers and students and Red Guards inBeijingwould nolonger be provided with food and train and bus services free of charge.But apparently,this decision was notstrictlyenforced asonFeb.3,1967,theCentralCommitteeandtheStateCouncilissuedanothercircular tostipulate that“Therevolutionary teachers and students and theRed Guardswhohavecome toBeijing and havenotpaid for their meals are as a rule required to pay for their meals as from February 8, and no more free meals will beprovided from that date." On November 16, 1966, it was stipulated that the chuanlian, mainly on foot, would beresumed from April 1967.But the chuanlian movement was officially called off on March 19 1967in that“thetasks of struggle-criticism-transformation [at local levels] are very complicated and heavy."See CCP Documentsof the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution,1966-1967,Union ResearchInstitute,Hong Kong,1968,pp.108-111,Pp.127-129,pp.227-232, and p.378.

In point of fact, the consequence of this kind of “wind of economism"turned out to be devastating.

Actually, this was a vested strategy for the Shanghai bureaucrats aimed atputting a stop the momentum of the CR. Right after the Anting Incident, in order toknow more about the inside stories of theWGH, Mayor CaoDiqiu ordered XiaMingfang, the deputy director of the Shanghai Industrial Political Department, toform the “Liaison Post of the Workers' Revolutionary Organizations". Instructed byMayor Cao, Xia Mingfang taught the staff persons of the Post to “do political workthrough economic work", that is, to attain the SPC's own political goal with money.50Thefirst secretary of the SPC ChenPixian once openly instructed his subordinates torelaxoneconomicissues:"Youshouldnotbeobstructionisttothemasses.Someissues, if possible, should be resolved." “You should not be very strict with economicdemands of the masses. Do not go against the masses' wishes.*51 In mid-November,49 See Jianjue datui you yigu jingjizhuyi yaofeng (Resolutely Repel another Evil Wind of Economism).This is aneditorialof Jiefangribao(LiberationDaily)inShanghai,January25,1967.Shanghaishiweicanku zhengya gongrenyundong dezuize nantao(TheSPC Cannot EscapeFromtheCriminalResponsibility of Ruthlessly SuppressingWorkers'Movement),in Zhibu shenghuo(LifeinPartyBranches),Nos.2-3 (Combined issue), Jan 17, 1967, ed. by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Zhibu shenghuo, Shanghaip.51.51 See the pamphlet “Annals of Opposing the Economism in Shanghai During the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution (For Discussion, Nov. 1966-March 15,1967)"(Wuchan jieji wenhua da geming zhong Shanghai

276many sent-down workers,who returned from remote border areas and were assignedtemporary jobs in factories, demonstrated against the Shanghai authorities about theunjust assignments and payments in the allocation system. In response, WangShaoyong, a senior cadre and deputy secretary of the Shanghai party, convenientlycharacterized this as merely an economic issue and promised to offer the protestorstwo million yuan per year in payment, yet did not address at all how to solve theunderlying problems in the labor system. Thereafter, out of Wang Shaoyong's promisea work group, led by a senior cadre Wang Ke, was formed to handle this allocationissue. This resolution, as an anti-economist narrative pointed out, "was a plot set upby Shanghai's black heads of the Party Committee, Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiuwhich meant to change the direction of struggle and marked the start of the evil windofeconomism."'52

Invigorated by the initial success of sent-down workers, many workers fromvarious underprivileged backgrounds united and raised similar economic issues to theShanghai authorities. In order to cater to the needs of those who rebelled for economicreasons, the SPC set up a special group on Nov. 29, headed by vice mayor SongRichang, to handle workers who complained about the labor system and wagepayments. As long as complaints and demands were economic in nature, MayorSong's responses were always positive and he was ready to sign anything related toeconomic demands.Another senior cadreWang Litian said: "My concern is how toestablish good relationships with those rebelling for economic reasons. We should befandui jingji zhuyi dashiji (taolun gao,1966.11-1967.3.15),Compiled by the Liaison General Headquarters ofOpposing the Economism, Shanghai Revolutionary Committee,March 17,1967.52Ibid.

In thebook Zhang Chunqiao and Shanghai's JanuaryRevolution,AndrewWalder charged that the CCRG people in Beijing, rather than the local power holders,were the criminals who unleashed the spate of economism nationwidely. The firstevidence Walder mentioned took place on Dec. 26, when "Jiang Qing met with adelegation of temporary and contract workers in Peking and endorsed their demandswhile denouncing the Ministry of Labor and Liu Shaoqi for supporting the ^corruptcontractlaborsystem."Walderclaimed thatitwasoneofthetworeasonsthattriggered the wind of economism. But a careful reading of the dialogues between thedelegation and Jing Qing reveals that the wind of economism related to the issue oftemporary and contract workers had already been fanned by the old power holders insome places before Jiang Qing's remarks. One of the delegates reported to Jiang Qingthat currently the power holders in some units were doing sabotage and playing tricksFor example, one day before, the power holders in the Chinese Academy of Scienceshad decided to immediately turn all contract workers into full time workers, in thehope of calming the workers' fighting will.34 While condemning Liu Shaoqi's53Ibid.54 In fact, as Cao Diqju later confessed, as early as November, 1966 the SPC signed to convert elementary schools

278operation of the temporary and contract worker system, apparently, Jiang Qingopposed theimmediate abolishmentof such asystem.Against thepower holders'newmove to promote temporary and contract workers tofull time workers immediatelyJiang Qing encouraged workers to oppose this kind of economism. She said: “Youshould reject their offering of turning you into full time workers. You contractworkers want revolution!" In this dialogue, Jiang Qing did propose to pay back wagesto the temporary and contract workers, albeit under strict conditions: during the CR itis forbidden to fire temporary and contract workers, who should be duly paid; thoselaid-off workers after June 1, 1966 (possibly for political reasons) have to be grantedjobs in their original units and their wages should be paid back to them.°? Thenumbers of such workers who werelaid off between June 1,1966 and Dec.26,1966in Shanghai should not be very big. Therefore, the argument can not be made thatJiang Qing's speech had triggered the wind of conomisim. If the numbers of suchworkers in Shanghai were large, it would conversely argue against Walder's claim thatthe Shanghai authority represented by Mayor Cao Diqiu did not fiercely suppress themasses.

AnotherpieceofevidencethatWalderusedtoaccusetheCCRGofbeingthemajor criminal whopropagated economismwas theeditorial of thePeople'sDailyrun by the local people to state-run ones. This gave an early green light to the economism. Contract workers fromrural areaswere unusually sent byrural communes,in the condition that the contractworkers should paysomeamount of money they earned in cities to their original communes. At the beginning of November, the old SPCagreed to the demands of contract workers from rural areas to raise their personal shares of payment compared tothe shares of communes,and soforth.See CaoDiqiu,CaoDiqiu'sSelf-Criticism(CaoDiqiu dejiancha),March121966.

279"Welcome the Upsurge of the Great CR in the Factories and Mines" released on thesame daywhenJiang Qing met with the workers'delegation,possiblyin accordancewith the CCRG's suggestion.Walder argues that this editorial "more than any othersingle event" was what “triggered the incidence of ‘economism' in Shanghai."56 Butin fact, this directive just elaborated on Jiang Qing's suggestions in the delegationmeeting. Walder did not quote the original text of this editorial, and his argumentscould be deduced from the following sentences, “The Party Center stipulates thatduring the great CR, the leaders of any factories and mines can not revenge andpersecute the masses who advance criticism and disclose facts; and it is forbidden toreduce or hold wages, fire workers, or expel contract workers and temporary workersbecause of this....those revolutionary workers who are persecuted and forced toleavefactories should be allowed to return to theirfactories to take part in production andthe CR. Revolutionary workers'wages since their forced leaving should be paidback."57 If Walder insisted that this directive alone triggered the economism, then itshould be the"Party Center”as a whole,including Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, notjust the CCRG, that should be held responsible.But obviously,the directivewasaimed at protecting the workers, including the contract and temporary workers frombeing politically persecuted and subjected to economic revenge. However, it did notnecessarily mean that a huge amount of money should be given away.

On January 1, 1967, moderated by Mayor Cao Diqiu, with the attendance ofsome major senior cadres of the SPC such as Wang Yipping, Song Richang, Song56Ibid.p.47.57Yingjiegongkuangqiyewenhua dageming de gaochao(Welcome theUpsurge of theGreat CRintheFactoriesandMines),inPeople'sDaily,Dec.26,1966

Let's do it first."59

This meeting exerted decisive influence upon Shanghai's economy. After thismeeting, all the city authorities were busy promoting wages and giving away bonusand compensations to the underprivileged workers and other people. Take the EastChina Electrical Management Bureau for example, the total monthly amount of wagespaid out had been 330,000 yuan; but at this point, the Bureau disbursed 1.28 millionyuan as compensation wages toworkersequivalent to about 4 months of the originalpayments.60 TThe rebels even called the Director and Party secretary of this Bureau,Chang Peichi, the “King of Signing"61 In another case, when a sampan rower Wu

01Chunhua and her 17 workmates went to the Shanghai Communication Bureau toinquire why the power holders reduced their wages from 70 yuan per month before58 The 5-point guidance was: 1.

2811956to 40yuan per month after1956,out of blue,the deputy director of the Shanghaicommunication Bureau, Zhou Yifan, proposed on his own initiative that they pay theworkers tenyears'compensatory wages since 1956.Therefore, the 18 workersreceived 22,600 yuan altogether and Wu Chunhua and her husband, both sampanrowers, received 4,128 yuan, which was a large amount of money at thattime.°According to incomplete statistics, in just the first seven days in 1967, due tothe wind of economism, thirty eight million yuan was withdrawn from Shanghaibanks.

The policy in rural areas was even worse. At the end of 1966, in accordancewith the so-called “grand democratic way of distribution,’ the slogan of the Shanghaiauthorities was to "grant all the funds to peasants". Thus, within a short time, manyrural brigades in Shanghai ran out of funds for production in 1967. Obviously, theseactions directed bycadres ineffect threw thewhole cityinto a state of financial crisisand disrupted the market. With such a financial deluge, the money flow for productionwould soon be drained dry. But the market appeared to be booming. In the first 8 daysof January, for example, the sales amount of the No.1 Chinese Department Storeincreased36.3%comparedwiththesameperiodlastyear.Asnumerousworkersrushed into the stores, the stocks of much merchandise ran out. On January 8, thestore had just opened its door when more than three hundred workers dashed in to buybicycles. Even many super-luxury commodities such as imported watches, thoughpriced atfourtofivehundredyuan(almostequal tooneyear'swageof acommon62Wu Chunhua, Chaopiao shoumai buliao women gongren (We Workers Cannot Be Bought By Money), inWorker'sRebelNews(Gongrenzaofan bao),No.3,Jan.14,1967.

282worker),wereswiftlycleanedout andwenttothewristsofhappycustomers.Sales ofhigh-class nylon materials increased many fold. People worried not about money, butabout what to buy in case the shops ran out of stock.6’If nothing was done to checkthis trend, it seemed that the market would soon have a scant supply of commodities

Running into a great gamble, the cadres soon found that there would be moreto lose than to gain in this devastated financial deluge. On the one hand, it made clearthat underprivileged laborers were not willing to be ruled over without redressingtheir grievances; on the other hand, the Shanghai authorities could not rule the peoplein the same old way,which oppressively decided the workers'fate without consensusbetween the ruled and the ruler.Yet what the authorities did dealt a heavy blow toShanghai's economy and in fact drove it into a politically suicidal condition:promoters of theCRinBeijingwould never tolerate the ongoingeconomicbankruptcy of China's biggest city, and the rebels would lose no chance of carryingout a power seizure. In the face of the chaotic economic and political situation, forboth the Center and the rebels, the SPC could no longer be trusted as a responsiblepolitical entity to run the city. With this in mind, the rebels began to think of seizingpower.Because those in power not only did not sincerely carry out the CR further, butseemedtoput thenormal operation of the city at risk,theissue ofpowerseizureoccurred to the rebelsfor the first time.On December 23,the Liaison Post of theWGH at Shanghai Port was expanded and renamed as thePort Headquarters of the63 See the pamphlet "Annals of Opposing the Economism in Shanghai During the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution (For Discussion,Nov.1966-March 15,1967)"(Wuchan jieji wenhua da geming zhong shanghai fanduijingji zhuyi dashiji (taolun gao,1966.11-1967.3.15),Compiled by the Liaison General Headquarters of OpposingtheEconomism,ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee,March17,1967.

283WGH. At its founding inauguration, the rebels, different from those economisticorganizations, swore to seize power: “The seals of proletarian dictatorship should bein the firm hands of proletarian revolutionaries.*64

The situation in Shanghai worsened with the advent of a general strike whichthe cadres sympathized with, anticipated, and to some extent directed. On December24, Mayor Cao signed an eight demand petition requested by the Scarlet Guards attheir rally of “Criticizing the Bourgeois Reactionary Line of the Shanghai MunicipalCommittee,” and proclaimed that the Scarlet Guards was a revolutionary massorganization. Moreover, he went so far as to announce that whatever commitments theSPC made to the WGH were null and void. The next day, in response, the WGH andits allies held a huge rally to“Criticize the Bourgeois Reactionary Line of theShanghai Municipal Committee Headed by Cao Diqiu'. Present at this rally, MayonCao had to apologize for meeting the demands of the Scarlet Guards and vehementlyproclaimed that it was the time to exert“proletarian dictatorship" over them, which, inthevocabulary at that time,meant to announce that theScarlet Guards were counterrevolutionary and should be demolished, and the major leaders of it should be jailedMayor Cao's quickly shifting stance,without a doubt, caused the relationship betweenthe WGH and the Scarlet Guards to deteriorate. Mayor Cao's call for exerting‘proletarian dictatorship" over the Scarlet Guards instigated the armed strugglebetween the two workers factions. To protest against Mayor Cao's new stance, theScarlet Guards decided to send a huge number of workers toBeijing to make an64 See “Long Live the Victory of the Great January Revolution"(Yiyue geming shengli wansui), from WorkersRebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),by theWGH,Jan.12,1968

284appeal.On December 25,the rebel Port Headquarters seized "black files"(that is,someevidencethatcouldlaterbeusedtoretaliateagainstrebelworkers)secretlycollected by the Party branch of Shanghai Port. In response to this, the Scarlet Guardsof the Shanghai Port formed their own Port Headquarters, intensifying the strugglesbetween two gigantic worker rivals day by day. At the same day, arranged bypower-holders in theRailwayBureau of theShanghai Municipal Committee andleaders of the Scarlet Guards,two trains loaded with conservative workers set off toBeijing to indict the SPC. Meanwhile, to force the SPC to rehabilitate its reputation.to teach a lesson to the rebels, and to exert pressure upon the rebels' supporters in theCenter,theScarlet Guards called itsleadersfor a meeting and decided to take a longshot gamble. Their new strategy was to make the whole greater Shanghai grind to ahalt. Since the majority of the Scarlet Guards consisted of members of the CommunistParty and Communist Youth League, who usually were model workers or skilledpermanent workers and held most of the management and administrative posts inenterprises, they got support, overtly or covertly, from authorities at most levels. TheScarlet Guards thus had the capacity and will to shut down the city of Shanghai. Afterthe meeting, part of Shanghai Port was shut down with a general strike by the ScarletGuards.

December 28 witnessed the outbreak of the Kangping Road Incident. In orderto settle scores with Mayor Cao's label that the Scarlet Guards (hence all the 800,000Scarlet Guards members)were“counter revolutionaries", several tens of thousands ofScarlet Guards flooded into Kangping Street, where the SPC was located. Even

285though their main target was Mayor Cao and was not to bring down the SPC, theydemanded thattheSPCre-validatethe"8demands"thatMayorCaohadbetrayedProvided the SPC made Mayor Cao apologize or even had Mayor Cao dismissed, theScarlet Guards would be on the side of the SPC again. Nonetheless,because of thisdemonstration, many factories stood still and sustained huge losses in production. Asthe Shanghai authorities could not appease the enraged workers, out of discontentwith the pro-rebel Zhang Chunqiao, many Scarlet Guards took their angrydemonstration to Zhang's residence in the same street, shouting that “it is right torebel against Zhang Chunqiao". For them, Zhang Chunqiao was the man behind thescenes who manipulated the rebel movement in Shanghai, and they wanted to arguewith him.Because some of them went directly to Zhang Chunqiao's house, it waswidely rumored that the Scarlet Guards ransacked Zhang's home, and even the houseof the late Shanghai mayor Ke Qingshi, who had been a sturdy Maoist and a strongsupporter for Jiang Qing's model operas before his death in 1965.65 At the time, theScarlet Guards openly proclaimed to Zhang's wife at home that if no responsiblepeople from the Center showed up and solved the issues before 18:00 pm, all thewaterandelectricitysupplyandtransportationwouldbetotallyshutdowninthewhole city. Meanwhile, a large number of Scarlet Guards laid siege to some rebelworkers from the nearby six provinces (and Shanghai) which were under thejurisdiction of theEast China Bureau of CCP,whostaged a sit-in outside the ChineseDepartment Store. Furthermore, the WGH rebels and students clashed with many65According to Scarlet Guards leaflets authored by Zhang Chunqiao's daughter Zhang Weiwei, who was a loyalist,some Scarlet Guards did mistakenly enter into Zhang Chunqiao's and Ke Qingshi's houses, but they did not dohousesearchingineitherplace.

286more Scarlet Guards outside theHengshanHotel. Low-intensity conflicts of violenceerupted across the city. Upon learning of the Kangping incident, Ma Tianshui, asecretary of the SPC, informed Zhang Chunqiao in Beijing via phone of the rumoredhouse-searching of his residence by the Scarlet Guards and their threat to shut downthe whole city.°° Possibly encouraged by Zhang Chunqiao, the WGH immediatelysent out contingents of propaganda teams and loudspeaker vans to launch a politicaloffensive and debate with the Scarlet Guards, though still outnumbered by theiradversaries. But the situation changed dramatically when 200,000 rebels led by GengJinzhang, the obstinate and unruly commander of the Second Corps of the WGHarrived at Kangping Street - since Geng's rebels did not hestitate to use force. Underattacks from 200,000 rebels, the Scarlet Guards were utterly and quickly disheartenedsince most of them were merely motivated by cadres within a short time thus hadneither a strong fighting will nor battle experiences like the rebels had in AntingMoreover, severely castigated by rebels and common citizens, the rumoredunreasonable yet fruitless house-search in Zhang Chunqiao's residence in fact led totheir own demoralization.When ferocious rebels descended on the Scarlet Guardsswinging punches, understandably, many of them took off their arm bands andescaped the battle field. The gigantic loyalist workers’ organization in Shanghaicollapsed due to this battle. After that, there were no major loyalist organizationsdefending the SPC and challenging the rebel forces. Furthermore, the SPC could notresort to the PLA for support either because the Shanghai garrison, in keeping with66 Wang Nianyi, Da dongluan de niandai (Years of Great Turmoil), Zhengzhou: He'nan renmin chubanshe, 1988,.p.169.

287MaoandLinBiao'sdirectiveofnon-involvementinthelocalCR,hadrefusedtheSPC's request of taking over the SPC and stabilizing the situation on the SPC side inthe early days of December 1966. The PLA had not yet been ordered to support"leftists". With the loss of solid support from the masses and the army, the power ofthe SPC was hence dramatically reduced. Naturally, the wholesale defeat of theScarletGuardsled directlytotheJanuaryRevolution.

The actions of the Scarlet Guards in effect paralyzed the whole city.As theKangping Street battle wore on, at two o'clock on December 30, a commander of theRailway LiaisonPost of the Scarlet Guards called relevant members through relatedrailway control rooms to go to the rescue in Kangping Street. Almost all workersbelonging to the Scarlet Guards in railway sections walked off from their workingstations.As a result,all trainswere stuck on thetracks and noinbound or outboundrailway transportation was available. On the same day, all post offices stoppedworking as well.67But all these mobilizations could not prevent the Scarlet Guardsfrom a debacle.Their defeat in theKangping Incident directly triggered the Kunshanbattlebetween the two workers'factions.Enraged with theharsh treatments theyreceivedfromtheWGH-affiliatedrebels,thedefeatedScarletGuardsstagedamassexodus from Shanghai which involved 60,000 to 100,000 workers'(numbers varyaccording to different sources) beginning on Dec. 30 - the superficial reason theygave was that they aimed to"reach Peking and protest the rebels to the Central67For the planning and practice of the general strike by the Scarlet Guards, see Qingkan chiweidui yixiaocuolingdaorendeyigefangemingdayinmou(PleaseHaveaLookof theGreatCounterrevolutionaryConspiracymanufacturedbyahandfulofleadersoftheScarletGuards),inZhibushenghuo(LifeinPartyBranches),No.4,Jan 25,1967.Ed.by theRevolutionaryRebel Headquarters of Zhibu shenghuo,Shanghai.pp.31-33.

Nevertheless,nobody cared about this stipulation. In more than 300 trucks (or simply on foot)thousands of Scarlet Guards drove off, heading for Beijing. Their action received fulllogistic support from local authorities. For example, “They got gasoline from afactory store, and the Kunshan County Committee gave them 100,000 yuan.*69At2:00 pm, more than 100 rebels decided to chase the departing Scarlet Guards and triedto persuade them to come back to work.When the handful of rebels arrived atKunshan, facing the resistance of numerous Scarlet Guards, fights broke out.

Eventually,byJanuary 9,severaltens of thousands ofloyalistworkers,withthe encouragement and assistance of the Shanghai power holders, successfully arrivedin Beijing.70 The general strike of the Scarlet Guards severely affected Shanghai'sproduction.Between Dec 25,1966 and the middle of Jan.1967, at the Shanghai GlassMachinery Factory—a public-private joint enterprise that employed more than 1,200workers—agoodmanyloyalistScarletGuardsstoppedgoingtowork.Wherewerethey? They were busy protesting against Mayor Cao's betrayal of the Scarlet Guards,as well as against the factory rebels' detention of and struggle with Yu Zixiang, one ofthe power holders at the Factory. A large number of lower-middle cadres, who weremembers of the Scarlet Guards and supposedly in charge of production, walked offtheir posts as well. As a result, the working drawings were kept locked, productionschedule was totally disrupted, and production virtually stopped in this factory.7Take the casting shop of the factory for example. During the Kunshan exodus, 35 outof 140 castingworkers left their working stations, about two-thirds of thefoundryworkers and half the production team leaders walked off; and among 4 technicians.only one remained in the factory. As for the three cadres in the casting shop, two ofthem who supported thewalkout,werebusyfeeding steamed bread to those departing70SunWeifanQingawengeqingliSunWeifanrijiExeriecing teQinghuasR:TheDairyofSuWefan)Hong Kong: Xianggang xinshiji chubanshe, 2008, p.104. Among this figure, at least 1,500 workers were in theofficial“"fu zhongyang gaozhuang tuan”(The Complaining Team to the Center),which was organized by theShanghai Scarlet Guards.

290people every day.Production was simply ignored and machines were at a standstill.

Out of such a difficult situation, as early as Dec. 27, a wall poster calling forpower seizure was put up, stating that as the original leading group in the factory nolong paid much attention to production, it was necessary to replace them with a“Workers’ Committee of Production Management" (later renamed the Committee ofGrasping Revolution and PromotingProduction, geming shengchan weiyuanhui).Thiswall poster attracted a great number of workers and over one hundred workers signedtheir names to show their approval of this poster right on the spot. According to aninvestigation of this factory by some Red Guards from the Shanghai KongjiangMiddle School who were stationed there, this poster provoked heated debates anddrastic struggles among rebel activists,

Somepeople said:“The old leadership is wily,and we canuse them tomanage the technological issues."But some vigorously opposed thisidea, and held that they should thoroughly make the revolution withoutanycompromisewith them.Torebelmeanstomakenewroads,notborrow an [old] road. It is not creditable to rely on the old leadershipAs the masses could tell the truth clearly,a hot debate was held in thefactory. And 80 percent of the masses agreed that all the four sectionmanagers of the old leadershipshould step down and work in plants."Grasping revolution and promoting production” or the idea of pureproduction?During thepreparatorystage of the committee,onecomrade who was in charge of liaison work in the committee talkedonly about shop drawings and production plans with other committeemembers. That was an example of narrowing things to pure production.Contrary to this, some others proposed to mobilize the masses for"grasping revolution and promoting production"and refused to beswayed over to the side of pure production. They put forward asharp-cut slogan “all powers go to the revolutionary left! To dorevolutionaryworkwemustfollowthemassline.Onecomradewhowas originallyresponsibleforliaisonsworkedfour days andachievednothing, as he did not follow the mass line. Once he put politics in

291command and followed the mass line, his section was quicklyestablished.72

After the debates, some rules of the proposed new power organ wereestablished: cadres taking part in collective productive labor; putting politics incommand and rejecting the idea of only paying attention to production; giving allpowers to the revolutionary left; and applying the principle of from the masses, to themasses.Ashundredsof theScarletGuardsintheShanghai GlassMachineryFactorywalked off to join the protest against the SPC, the rebels who kept working in thefactory decided to take responsibility for running the whole factory, even with ashortage of hands. On Dec. 30, when the battle between the Scarlet Guards and rebelworkers roared in Shanghai, initiated by the rebels and in accordance with theprinciple of the Paris Commune, the Committee of Grasping Revolution andPromoting Production—a brand new power organ—was officially established througha “Paris Commune-style general election" in the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory.Through secret ballots, workers in the factory elected 10 people at the levels of thework team, workshop, and section office.A striking feature of this“Paris Communestyle"election was that all the “chief"(zhang) titles were discarded.All the electedpeople were called"servants"(fuwuyuan) as the rebels maintained that they were notrebeling for personal or private interests, but in order to eliminate revisionism andbuild socialism.Every elected“servant"should dedicate themselves to“serving the72 The Regiment of Learning the Industry of the Shanghai Kongjiang Middle School and Journalists of RedGuardsBattleNews,Weida MaoZedong sixiang buyuxia deyou yi xinzheng shiwu:Shanghaiboli jixiechanggemingshengchanweiyuanhuidiaochabaogao,kongjiangzhongxuexuegongbingtuan,hongweizhanbaojizhe(Another New Thing Nurtured by the Great Mao Zedong's Thought: An Investigation Report of the Committee ofGrasping theRevolution and Promoting theProductionin the Shanghai GlassMachineryFactory),quotedfromPeople'sDaily,Jan.23,1967.

Thecommitteewillendeavor tobreakwiththefour olds andestablishthefour news, and form a brand new mode of relationships among thepeople.73

More or less, this was a real attempt to revolutionize the socialist managementand relationships among the people in the factory in accordance with with the viewMao had expressed in his enthusiastic affirmation of the so-called Constitution of theAnshan Iron and Steel Complex (the “An'gang constitution,” for short) (1960). In thepre-CR years, most enterprises in China just followed Fordist and Taylorist ways ofrunningfactories,whichwereintroducedfrom theUssR—characterized byhierarchical order and a rigid division of labor. Just as William Hinton astutelypointedout:73 Ibid. The "four olds" means the old ideas, culture, customs and habits; and the "four news" means the new ideas,culture,customs andhabits.

293Ateverystepoftheway,however,Mao'slinemetoppositionandresistance, primarily from a more “orthodox"group at the center thatconsidered the party tobe above external supervision and capable ofself-rectification without immersing itself in great mass movements ofthe people. This group, disregarding the masses as creators of history.relied on planners; instead, stressed technology and expertise,hierarchy and one-man management. It one-sidedly pushed materialincentive as the key to progress and neglected groundwork for thebuilding of socialism.?

But during the Great Leap Forward (1958-1960), a period of boostingtechnical innovations and political revolutions in Chinese enterprises, Ma Bing, theParty secretary of the Anshan Iron and Steel Complex, based on revolutionaryexperiencesinpromotingproduction,submitted A Report ofTechnicalInnovationsandRevolutionsontheIndustrialFronttotheCentralCommitteeinBeijing.Thisindustrial report was named and hailed by Mao as “An'gang constitution",characterized by “Two Participations, One Reformation, and Three Combinations",that is, cadres participate in production labor and workers participate in managementreplacing those unreasonable with reasonable rules and regulations; and combiningleading cadres, technicians, and workers together in carrying out technical innovationsand revolutions. In his comments on Ma Bing's report, Mao praised that "the An'gangConstitution has emerged in the Far East,in China."The Soviet style Fordist andTaylorist way of industrial management was in fact vertical and hierarchical, underwhich managers were usually appointed by direct leaders, not through generalelections by the masses, hence they only bore responsibility for leaders, not forworkers, and could hardly include the initiatives of the workers. This happened in the74 William Hinton,μMao, Rural evelopment, and Two-Line Struggle", inMonthly Review,February 1994, ol.45,issue 9, pp.1-15.

294Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory,too.In Feb.6, 1955, the Party organ, the People'sDaily, publicized a letter from a worker in this factory, complaining that factoryleaders ignored a worker Jiang Shanhong's invention, which could improveproductivity at least ten times in ampoule-production. Even though the power holdersof the factory acknowledged that his invention was good, when Jiang Shanhong urgedfactory leaders to adopt his invention, they simply ignored him. Even Jiang's attemptto put up a wall poster to criticize the leaders was stopped. Similarly, in the samefactory, another worker Shi Luguan invented a speed changer. It suffered the samefate as Jiang Shanhong's invention.At the end of the letter, the author claimed thatthere were numerous similar cases in his factory that"not only frustrated creativity,but also made the country suffer unnecessary losses."/3Even though Mao gave a highevaluation on the “An'gang Constitution" during the Great Leap Forward, some yearslater, most enterprises still did not adopt Mao's industrial policy in line with theAn'gang Constitution until Mao put forward a strong call for “learning from Daqingin industry" in 1964. Nevertheless, so long as the cadres and managers did notrevolutionize their minds to serve the people, and factory workers could not freelyelect their managers from their own ranks, gains from new industrial reformation ofmanagementwouldbelimited.

In 1965, Mao wrote a poignant criticism of the emerging “capitalists" in thesocialist education movement, which touched upon the issue of management and therisk of managers becoming bureaucratists.75 A Worker from the Shanghai Glass Factory, *The Shanghai Glass Factory Does Not Pay Much Attention toReasonable Advices of theWorkers",People'sDaily,Feb.6,1955.

295

Management is a kind ofsocialist education aswell.If managerial staffdon't go to workshops to eat, live, and labor together with workers (santong), andlearn form master workers one or several skills, they will stay in a state of tenseclass struggle with the working class forever; and they can onlybe seen asbourgeois and will finally be brought down by the working class. If one doesn'tlearn technology and stay a laypersons over a long period of time,one will not begood at any management. It's no good to try to enlighten others while remainingin darknessandconfusion oneself.

The class of bureaucratists stands in sharp opposition with the workingclass and the poor and lower-middle peasants. These people have become or arebecoming bourgeois elements who suck the workers'blood.How can they realizethis? They are the objects of struggle and revolution. Never depend on them inthesocialisteducationmovement.Whatwecan dependon are thosecadreswhoare not hated by workers, and are imbued with a revolutionary spirit.76

Apparently, if managers and experts disengaged themselves from manual labor,it would be very hard for them toknow thefeelings and wishes of common workers.Detaching themselves from the masses and privileged by high salaries and perks.those bureaucrats and technocrats were prone toform their own interest group, whichwas identified by Mao as the bureaucratist class.This dangerous inclination reallyconcerned Mao.Once the interest group was formed,in order to consolidate the statusquo and expand moreinterests,the bureaucratistclasswould try their best toinstitutea vertical system of management, emphasizing the technology and expertisehierarchy and one-man management", as William Hinton pointed out above. Thismode of management not only stifled the initiatives of workers,as seen in theShanghai Glass Factory in pre-CR years, but also and more importantly suppressed76 Mao Zedong, “Comments on Comrade Chen Zhengren's Report of His On-the-spot Investigation" (Dui ChenZhengren tongzhi dundianbaogaode pishi),Jan.29,1965,fromLongLiveMaoZedongThought(MaoZedongsixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.227,printed in Wuhan,1967-1968，for details about this collection,see note 27.

296workers'democratic rights.Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Maowarned that oncetheworkers'hatredfor thesevampiresgottobetoomuchtobear,then this bureaucratist class could be quickly overthrown. That is exactly whathappened in the Shanghai Glass Machinery Factory with the January Storm in the lastdays of 1966,when the cadres and conservativeworkers whofollowed them went onstrike for the Kangping and Kunshan battles. The rebel workers of the Glass Factory.grasping a rare historical chance, kicked out all the old bureaucratic cadres since theybelieved that "these cadres have already been degraded to be the objects of therevolution. You can neither grasp revolution, nor promote production withoutremoving them."//  In carrying forward the extensive democracy of the proletariat anda Paris Commune-style general election, the glass factory formed a self-governanceentity, a workers'power organ that effected a kind of flat system of management thatran counter to the hierarchical and vertical system of management instituted by theold bureaucrats and technocrats. For the first time in this factory, the right to manageand run a factory were entirely in the hands of common workers. This was consideredthe most important way to prevent the restoration of a privileged class. The action intheShanghaiGlassFactorywasinfact onepart oftheJanuaryStorm.TheJanuaryStorm, sometimes also called the January Revolution, refers to the power seizuremovement byShanghai rebelsfrom theendof1966totheearlyFebruaryof1967thatmade possible the establishment of the Shanghai Commune. This mass-initiatedmovement was legitimated by a message of gretting from the Center and the CCRG77 *In Praise of the Committee of Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production" (Zan geming shengchanweiyuanhui),from Red Guard Battle News (Hongwei zhanbao),Shanghai,Jan.,1967,quoted fromPeople's DailyJan.23,1967.

The seemingly trivial change of abandoning all the“chief"titles in theShanghai Glass Factory wasformal and symbolic,but what it revolutionized inpracticewentfarbeyond that.The10workerselected as“servantsofthepeople"inthe factory could be classified as working in three categories: production, the workersunion and political life. In line with the principles of the Paris Commune, all of themwere subject to be recalled at anytime if the masses were dissatisfied.“This carriesforward and guarantees the realization of the extensive democracy of the proletariat inthe most adequate and effective way."79Afterassumingtheirresponsibilities,alltheelected servants of the people decided not to hang around in offices, nor sit on sofas.Instead, they always carried their working tools. Having this position was like a parttime job, and their main job being working on the shop-floor with the commonworkers. But what disappeared was the deep-rooted phenomena of having cadres whostood high above and detached from the masses and practice.Furthermore, theCommittee of Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production solemnly proclaimed:78 See “Message of Greetings to Revolutionary Rebel Organizations in Shanghai, From the Central Committee ofthe Chinese Communist Party,the State Council, the Military Commission of theParty's Central Committee andthe Cultural Revolution Group Under the Party's Central Committee”(Zhonggong zhongyang guowuyuanzhongyang junwei zhongyangwengexiaozu gei Shanghai shi gegeming zaofan tuanti dehedian),inPeople'sDaily Jan.12,1967,the English version can be found at Peking Review,No.4，January 20,1967.After the term"January Revolution”was coined in Shanghai and then a People's Daily editorial on Jan. 31, 1967 used“the stormof JanuaryRevolution”to promote Shanghai's model to the whole country.See“On theProletarianRevolutionaries'Struggle toSeize Power”(Lun wuchan jieji geming pai deduoquan douzheng),fromPeople'sDaily Jan.31,1967,and the English version can be found at Peking Review,No.6,February 3,1967.See also“Zhang Chunqiao's Speech at the Enlarged Session of the Central Military Committee”(Zhang Chunqiao zaijunwei kuoda huiyi shangdejianghua),April14,1967,fromResearchMaterials of theGreatCultural Revolution(Wenhua da geming yanjiu ziliao), Vol. I, p.424, Beijing: Zhongguo renmin jiefangjun guofang daxue dangshidangjianzhenggong jiaoyan shi,1988.9The Regiment of Learning the Industry of the Shanghai Kongjiang Middle School and Journalists of RedGuards Battle News,“Another New Thing Nurtured by the Great Mao Zedong's Thought:An Investigation Reportof the Committee of Grasping theRevolution and Promoting theProduction in the Shanghai Glass MachineryFactory”(Weida MaoZedong sixiangbuyu xiadeyouyi xinzheng shiwu:Shanghai boli jixiechanggemingshengchanweiyuanhui diaochabaogao,kongjiangzhongxuexuegongbingtuan,hongweizhanbaojizhe),quotedfrom People'sDaily,Jan.23,1967.

We put the revolution in the first place, and use revolution tocommand and drive production.80

After the establishment of the Committee,factory workersgreatlyimprovedtheir consciousnesses of building socialism and took the initiative to solve seriousproduction problems due to the shortage of workers caused by theScarlet Guardsstrike or due to deliberate sabotage.Forinstance,when the technical instructionsforproducing products were hidden by some saboteurs in the No. 4 shop, the lacquererteam consisting of rebel workers in this shop tried very hard to do many experiments.and finally figured out the directions and fulfilled the job with flying colors.*1 Whenpoliticswerein command,monetaryincentives were not abig concern and workerstookanactivepartincreativework.Workersvolunteeredtotakeonextraworkandstay overtime without any demand for extra bonuses.Take the lathemen in the GlassFactory for example.After completing their own work in the shop, theyenthusiasticallyhelped other workshops.

The de facto self-governance of workers in the Shanghai Glass MachineryFactory also got high praise from the rebels and the Maoist leadership in Beijing. OnJan. 14, 1967, the Central Party organ of CCP, the People's Daily put out an articlehailing the formation of the Committee of Grasping Revolution and PromotingProduction.83 On January 23, the People's Daily reprinted two more articles that82 The Regiment of Learning the Industry of the Shanghai Kongjiang Middle School's Mao Zedong ThoughtRevolutionaryCommitteeStationedatShanghaiGlassMachineryFactory(ShanghaiKongjiangzhongxueMaoZedongsixianggemingweiyuanhuizhuShanghaiboli jixiechangxuegongbingtuan),Weida dechuangju:reliehuanhugemingshengchanweiyuanhuidedansheng(TheGreatCreation:WarmlyHailingtheBirthoftheCommittee of Grasping theRevolution andPromoting theProduction)，Jan.12,1967.ALeaflet.83MaoZhuxidegemingluxianyouyixindeshengli!Gongkuangwenhuadagemingzhongyigechuangju!Shanghaibolijixiechangjianligemingshengchanweiyuanhui(AnotherNewVictoryof ChairmanMao'sRevolutionaryLine!A Creation amid the Great CulturalRevolutioninFactories andMines!Shanghai Glass

It is a committee that grasps revolution as well as promotes production,a political, production and workers’ committee spontaneously andconsciously organized by the masses; it crystallizes the wisdom of themasses enlightened by the Mao Zedong Thought; it is a product of thegeneral election system of the Paris Commune; and it is a committeethat will give the four-olds and the revisionism a swinging attack andthorough opposition.84

Seen as an embryo of communist organizational form, the Committee was saidto point the way to revolutionize all factories and mines throughout the country. Itheralded, to some degree, the coming of the Shanghai People's Commune.Nevertheless, this committee was constitutionally flawed because it excluded a goodmany conservative Scarlet Guards and almost all the old cadres who therebelsconsidered “capitalist roaders".And so did the Shanghai People's Commune. Later,the Committee in the Glass Factory had to incorporate representatives from rivalworkers aswell as old cadres.

Takeover duringtheJanuaryStorm

The power seizure in the Shanghai Glass MachineryFactory exerted enormousinfluence on all factories in Shanghai, serving as a model for rebel workers to followand a threat to those cadres and loyalist workers who defended the pre-CR order. It ineffect anticipated power-seizures on a greater scale and the final total take-over by themasses in Shanghai, which reached its climax in the inauguration of the ShanghaiCommune two month later.

On January 1,1967, the Party organs the People's Daily and the Red FlagjointlyreleasedaneditorialtitledCarrytheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolutionThroughtotheEnd,whichproclaimed:

1967 will be a year of all-round development of class strugglethroughoutChina.

It will be a year in which the proletariat, united with othersectors of the revolutionary masses, will launch a general attack on thehandful ofpersonswithin thePartywhoarein authorities and aretaking the capitalist road, and on the ghosts and monsters in society.

It will be a year of even more penetrating criticism andrepudiation of the bourgeois reactionaryline and elimination of itsinfluence.85

Encouraging people to wage an “all-round" class struggle against thebureaucrats who were taking the capitalist road, this editorial did not, however, sayanything about“power seizures".But in face of the workers’ferocious rebellions, oldcadres and their supporters went on strike out of their political instinct, attempting to85 Quoted from Peking Review, No. 1, January 1, 1967.

302exert pressure on theMaoists'leadership.At the time,a power vacuum and anopportunity for therebels toseizepower was created.When and where the old rulersdid not take their responsibility for running society, their authority and legitimacy wasseriouslyjeopardized and it became possiblefor their power tobe transferred to otherpolitical forces.That was what happened in Shanghai in the January Storm

Let me now go back to the Scarlet Guards'exodus and spate of monetaryincentives that continued in the beginning of 1967. On January 4, the first secretary ofthe SPC, Chen Pixian advocated making it easier to offer material incentives to themass organizations. In line with this, the SPC prepared 50 propaganda vans and 3,000bicycles to be distributed upon request. Moreover, Chen Pixian approved manydemands proposed by groups organized around economic issues and this resulted inthe formation of many more of these types of organizations. During the January Stormin Shanghai, there were at least 354 such economic-centered organizations such as the“Rebel Revolutionary Headquarters for Housing Difficulties,”“Rebel Headquartersfor RevolutionaryBachelor Workers","RevolutionaryRebel Headquarters forPermanent Residents with Temporary Household Registration", and so forth. “Theirfocuswasnotcentrallyconcernedwiththeissueof attackingordefendingpartyleaders. Their focus was directed instead on redressing socioeconomic grievances.*"86Even though their economic demands could be justified, the formation of so manyeconomicorganizationswithin averyshortperiodoftimecomplicated thetheeconomic and political situation at the time, and contributed greatly and quickly to the86 Perry and Li Xun 1997, p.97.

303monetarydeluge andeconomicdisruptioninShanghai.Meanwhile,overtly orcovertly encouraged by cadres, large numbers of Scarlet Guards kept going north to“lodge complaints" about the Kangping Street and Kunshan battles, and many teamsorganized around “lodging complaints” were in fact led by party secretaries. When theparty secretary at the No. 7 district of the Port was about to sail the “Battle No. 34"ship with nearly 1,0o0 Scarlet Guards on board heading for Beijing, an old rebelworker risked his life to climb onto the ship and drag the party secretary off the shipand struggled with him, Yet many ships, with the cooperation of the Port authorities.succeeded in their trips to the north. The party secretary of the Shanghai Port BureauLi Guang, who was called a “specialist on signing”(qianming zhuanjia) because hewas ready to sign any economic demands from people, also encouraged severalhundred loyalist workers to embark on the “No. 17 Worker-Peasant-Soldier”ship toBeijing.87

In walking off their jobs, the Scarlet Guards effectively disrupted Shanghai'sproduction and communications.As mentioned earlier, they even deliberatelyattempted to cut off the city's water and electricity and throw the transportationsystem and the Shanghai Port into chaos, which they were partly successful. TheShanghai Port, for example, was almost brought to a standstill. Statistics available areincomplete, but due to the port authorities’ generous distribution of state funds fortravel subsides, compensatory wages and bonuses to workers, the Shanghai Port paidout more than 1,480,000 yuan to workers between Jan.1 and Jan. 9 in a planned wind81Li Guang pohuai haigang yunshu de taotian zuixing (Li Guang's Towering Crimes to Sabotage the PortTransportation),in Zhibu shenghuo (Life in Party Branches),No.4,Jan 25,1967.Ed.by the Revolutionary RebelHeadquarters ofZhibu shenghuo,Shanghai.p.26.

304of economic “anarchy" 8*As Neale Hunter personally observed in Shanghai at thisconjuncture,

There can be little doubt that the run on the banks was organized.Whether the orders came from Liu Shaoqi himself is debatable; butthey seem to have come from as high as the Municipal PartyCommittee, which still controlled the loyalty and sympathy of theShanghai Party. The timing and the extent of the phenomenonprecluded spontaneity.In this case,the Rebels,who saw plotseverywhere, were probably right in blaming the Party leaders.8

As a result, at the wharves along, nearly 6,0o0 workers left their posts. Someheaded north to lodge complaints, while others simply went shopping with the moneythey had just received from the authorities. Consequently, from New Year's day to theeighth of January, there was a daily average of more than 70 national and internationalcargoships stuck at theport due totheshortage ofstevedores tounload, and on oneday the number evenreached140.Of the198ships of the ShanghaiFisherman'sCompany, only 5 or 6 ships went out to sea everyday, reducing the daily hauls of fishby more than 90 per cent. Just in the first 9 days of January, the port had tocompensate foreign ships several hundred thousand pounds for their losses - inaddition to compensations that were paid to national ships. To protest the chaos at theShanghai port, some foreign ships even intentionally hung the Chinese national flagsupside down."° Railway transportation was equally disrupted:88 Ibid.p.25.89 Neale Hunter, 1969, p.216.90Li Guang pohuaihaigang yunshu de taotianzuixing (Li Guang'sToweringCrimes toSabotage thePortTransportation),in Zhibu shenghuo (Life in Party Branches), No.4, Jan 25,1967.Ed.by the Revolutionary RebelHeadquarters of Zhibu shenghuo, Shanghai.pp.26-27.Also see Yiyue geming shengli wansui (Long Live theVictory of the Great January Revolution),in Workers'Rebel News (Gongren zaofan bao), Jan.12,1968;alsoPerry& Li, 1997,p.115.

305At thattime,thefourgatesof theNorthStationwere openedwide,butthere was no one to collect tickets. From the first to the eighth, thepassenger trains from Shanghai to Nanjing and Hangzhou—whichaccording to schedule should have numbered 21 per day—totaled only17, and were, moreover, all late. The freight trains were supposed tonumber 23 a day, but in actuality numbered only 3. Measured intonnage, only about 11% of the planned freight was actually hauled.91

The nearly paralyzed port and railway transportation made it difficult to movegoods necessary for daily life to Shanghai, so Shanghai was poorly supplied. Underthe strike by the Scarlet Guards, the city was running out of coal for industry andwould soon run out of coal for family use. Unfortunately, this was a severely coldwinter with some snow, and citizens had to wait in long lines to purchasemuch-needed heating materials. Due to the lack of coal, the largest power plant inShanghai, the Yangshupu plant, was unable to generate electricity for the whole cityfor three days. Obviously, the huge strike led by Shanghai's power-holders not onlyparalyzed the city's production, but also threatened the maintenance of daily life.92

On January 1, facing the threat of a total economic collapse in Shanghai, somerebel leaders gathered at the East Lake Rest House,with the presence of the firstsecretary of the SPC Chen Pixian, to discuss how to save Shanghai from possibleeconomic bankruptcy. At this meeting,they unanimously agreed to stabilize theeconomy by appying the principle of “grasping revolution and promoting production".At this crucial moment, if the revolution could not eventually enhance production, andmerely brought about the paralysis or bankruptcy of the city, how could the rebels winthe support they needed from the Maoist leadership and the masses? On January 3, the91 Perry and Li 1997, p.115.92SeeYiyue geming shengliwansui (Long Live theVictory of the Great January Revolution),inWorkersRebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),Jan.12,1968.

306WGH convened the responsible leaders from a variety of rebel organizations at No.922, Hua Mountain Street for a meeting titled “Grasping Revolution and PromotingProduction, Defending the Socialist Shanghai'". Late at night, some workers and RedGuards, led by Shu Zechi and Wang Liping from the Central Conservatory of Music.drafted an article of the utmost importance entitled“Take Firm Hold of theRevolution, Promote Production and Utterly Smash the New Counter-AttackLaunched by the Bourgeois Reactionary Line—Message to All Shanghai People",urging the masses to promote production while grasping revolution, and fiercelyattacking the slow-downs and strikes of the Scarlet Guards.93 The message wasimmediately printed into 200,000 leaflets and circulated by the rebels throughout thecity."4 But no major newspaper, all of which were still in the Party's hands, agreed toreprint this rebel message. At the end of 1966 and the beginning of 1967, although therebels moved toseizepowerfromthe old power holders at all levels of administration,they did not have a major newspaper as a mouthpiece to voice their demands andexpand their influence.TheWGH's newspaper"Worker's Rebel News”(gongrenzaofan bao) was first published on Dec. 28, 1966 and had a circulation of only 30,000per issue,which did notevencover theWGH's own members.Therefore,WenhuiDaily andLiberationDaily,thetwolargest andinfluential newspapers oftheSPC thatseldom brought out rebel news even in this turbulent period, naturally became targetsof power seizures. On January 3, 1967, a rebel group within the Wenhui Daily named93 Jin Chunming, Wenhua dageming lunxi (Discussion and Analysis of the Great CR), Shanghai: Shanghairenminchubanshe,1985.p.95.94YangXiaobing,“TheWritingof‘Message toAllShanghaiPeople'and‘Urgent Notice'"(Gaoquan shirenminshu'he jinji tonggao'de chansheng jingguo),in January Storm, joint issue of No.5 and No.6,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai.YangXiaobingwas a Red Guard of the"Rebel to the End"Corps of the Shanghai JiaotongUniversityand one of the members of thedraft team of the“Message toAll ShanghaiPeople”

307“theSpark that Starts aPrairie Fire"launched a power seizure of the paper.And afterthis, the SPC was pushed aside from any authoritative role in this major party organ.95In the first issue of the newborn Wenhui Daily, rebels claimed that it should be arevolutionary rebel newspaper; that it should be a battlepositionfor theleftists towage all-round class struggles; and that its general policy would follow a“leaning-to-one-side policy", that is, one in favor of the rebels. The same issue alsoreprinted anold articlebyMaotitled"TheBourgeoisOrientationoftheWenhuiDailyshouldbeCriticized"(Wenhuibaodezichanjiejifangxiangyingdangpipan)writtenin1957, when the Wenhui Daily had been severely criticized by Mao for its sympathywith bourgeois intellectuals. The Wenhui Daily was the first major party organ seizedby the rebels as their own ideological propaganda weapon during the January Storm

On January 4, the CCRG sent Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan back toShanghai. The next day, Zhang and Yao convened a meeting of rebel leaders from therailway, the port, and all bureaus to discuss how to check the spread of economicdisorder.Zhang astutelypointed out that itwas necessary to disclose thatsignaturesand promises, which the old power-holders randomly made to economic demands,actually disrupted production and sabotaged the CR in Shanghai, and was, in fact, anew manifestation of the bourgeois reactionary line.All rebel leaders, Zhang stressedshould educate the masses not to rebel merely for economic reasons; if economicreasons were the people's sole aim in rebelling, they would thwart the process of the95 The power seizure of the Wenhui Daily happened on January 4, 1967, before Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan returned to Shanghai.According to the study of a Party historian Jin Chunming,there is not enoughevidence to prove that Zhang and Yao directed the first power seizure in Shanghai. See Jin Chunming, Yiyueduoquanwentimingbian(ClarifyingtheProblemsRelatedtotheJanuaryPowerSeizure),inJinChunmingzixuanwenji(Jin Chunming'sSelected Essays).Chengdu:Sichuan renmin chubanshe.JinJichun,ed.2002,p.473.

308CR andmakeitpossibleforChinatochangeitscolorfromsocialismtocapitalismAlso at this meeting, the rebel group “The Spark That Starts a Prairie Fire” of theWenhui Daily proposed to Yao Wenyuan, that the above mentioned “Message to AllShanghai People’leaflet be reprinted in the new newspaper. To thisYao just said thatneither he nor Zhang Chunqiao could give them an answer since they had just arrivedin Shanghai and were not clear about the situation; and it was up to the rebels todecide whether or not to publish it on this major newspaper.9

On January 5, 1967, the Wenhui Daily seized by the rebels put out the“Message to All Shanghai People", which signaled a crucial move for the powerseizure on a larger scale in Shanghai and in the entire country.With the signatoriesfrom 11 rebel organizations led by the WGH, the message made the accusation that,

A handful of personswithin theParty who are in authoritiesandtakingthecapitalistroadandthosewhoobstinatelyfollowthebourgeois reactionary line have a bitter hatred for the Great ProletarianCultural Revolution. They have been trying by every means to resistthe policy of "taking firm hold of the revolution and promotingproduction” put forward by Chairman Mao. Their schemes and devicesmaybe summarized in thefollowingways:

At the beginning of the movement, they used the pretext of"takingfirmholdofproduction"torepress therevolutionandopposetakingfirmhold of therevolution.Whenweworkers of therevolutionary rebel groups wanted to rise up in revolution and criticizeand repudiate the bourgeois reactionary line, they used the tasks ofproductiontobringpressure tobear on theworkers and tagged uswiththe label of “sabotaging production." Did they really want to "take firmhold of production"? No, they wanted to defend their own positions

and attempted toobstruct ourrevolution.Weexposed theirschemes96SeeChenPixian,TheMemoirofChenPixian:attheCenterofJanuaryStormChenPixianhuiyilu:zaiyiyuefengbao de zhongxin),p.123,Shanghai:Shanghairenmin chubanshe,2005.Clearly,from this case we could seethat“the Message toAll ShanghaiPeople”was a product of the mass-initiated movement,rather than a movementfrom above closely and tightly controlled by Mao or others,such as Zhang Chunqiao orYaoWenyuan,as somescholarshaveclaimed.

309androseupbravelyinrebellion.

Then they resorted to another trick, that is, they played withhigh-sounding revolutionary words, giving the appearance of beingultra "Left" in order to incite large numbers of members of theWorkers'Red Militia Detachments whom theyhad hoodwinked toundermine production and sabotage transport and communicationsunder the pretext of going north to "lodge complaints." They did this toattain their aim of undermining the Great Proletarian CulturalRevolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. More recently, ahandful of reactionary elements were even plotting to cut off water andelectricitysupplies and bringpublic transport to a standstill.We mustdrag out these reactionary elements and exercise proletariandictatorship over them, punish them severely, and never allow them tosucceed in their criminal schemes.91

For the rebel workers in Shanghai, this was in fact an official call to arms tofight against the spate of economism and the old party bosses who were from behindthe scenes, egged on and manipulated the conservative workers' movement. At thattime,Mayor CaoDiqiuhad alreadylosthiscredibility and prestigeintheeyesofboththe rebel and loyalist workers, and the first secretary of the SPC Chen Pixian was alsounder ferocious attack from the rebels since the beginning of the newyear. But tosome extent, they still controlled the Party system of Shanghai. For instance, Chenand Cao called for a meeting of administrative directors and director generals at alllevels to give a green light to the wind of economism. If Shanghai's economy didcollapse, the rebels had everything to lose and the old Party apparatus would haverestored their power again using the excuse trying to revive the economy with the helpfrom administrative bureaucrats, experts and loyalist workers. This was thebackground that underlay the issuance of the“Message to All Shanghai People". As97 See Wenhui Daily Jan.5, 1967. It was reprinted in People's Daily on Jan. 9, 1967, and its English version couldbe found at Peking Review,No.3,Jan.13,1967.

310Premier Zhou Enlai called and urged the first secretary of SPC, Chen Pixian, to runthe business of Shanghai at the time, Chen participated in the discussion of thismessage and signed the order to print it in leaflets. But it was the rebels who, in thehope of stabilizing order in Shanghai and giving Chen one more chance to rectify hiserrors, drafted the message and then circulated it in leaflets and also spread it throughtheWenhui Dailylater onJanuary5,1967.But the resistance the Messageencountered from the still influential party apparatus was strong. Another majorShanghai newspaper Liberation Daily in the party hands refused to publish theMessage under the pretext that it explicitly criticized the SPC by name and that itwould incur struggles among the masses because it referred to the Scarlet Guards.99After intensive struggles,the rebels within the newspaper office seized the LiberationDaily and released the message on January 6, 1967.

Mao Zedong paid close attention to the process of the CR in Shanghai since it,being the largest city, occupied a pivotal position in the entire country. At a talk withthe CCRG members on Jan.9,1967,he confirmed that the mass takeover of WenhuiDaily and Liberation Daily by leftists represented the correct direction, and stressedthatwhenever one wantedtomake revolution,onehad toinvoke thevoxpopulifirstMaoclarifiedthat:

Internal rebellions are fine. In a few days we can make a general reporton them. This is one class overthrowing another. This is a greatrevolution. Many papers in my opinion would be better closed down.

But newspapers must still come out. The question is by whom they are98 See Chen Pixian 2005, p.123.99 See“Long Live the Victory of the Great January Revolution” (Yiyue geming shengli wansui),Workers'RebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),Jan.12,1968.

It refers to the city of Shanghai butthe problem it discussed is of national significance.100

Atthesametalk,Maowasverymuchconsciousthatthewindofeconomism.if not stopped, could do fatal harm to the CR and the construction of socialism inChina since it was by no means limited only to Shanghai. Rather, it was a nationalphenomenon that was rampaging in other parts of China,not only the cities, but alsorural areas. For example, in Nanjing, all factories stopped production and allferryboats ceased running due to the economist wind. In Beijing, many factoriespractically stopped production. In Beijing Station, as the workers and conductors wenton strike and petitioned the State Council, only five trains were dispatched per day.whereas in normal times, there would be more than 300 trains dispatched per day.01Reading through all of the new issues of Wenhui Daily published after the powerseizure,Maowassodelightedwith the“MessagetoAllShanghaiPeople"that hesuggested thatthePeople'sDailyreprintitimmediately.Hecontinued,

312and then the Communist Party. We had no funds, no printing press, nobicycles. When we ran newspapers we were very friendly with theworkers and chatted with them as we edited articles...We must speakof grasping revolution and promoting production. We must not makerevolution in isolation from production. The conservative factions donot grasp production. This is a class struggle.You must not believe that'When Chang the Butcher is dead, we'll have to eat pork bristles andall', or that we can do nothing without them. Don't believe that sort ofrubbish.

Yet Mao admonished that it was not necessary to overthrow and dismiss all theold cadres. “We should establish links with all sorts of people, left, right and center. Ihave never agreed with a unit being all that pure in its approach." Someone thenmentioned thatWuLengxi,adismissed oldcadrewhowas oncethechiefeditor ofPeople's Daily, was so comfortable that he had put on weight. To this Mao responded."We have allowed Wu Leng-hsi [Lengxi] to become too comfortable. I am not infavor of their dismissal. Let them remain at their posts to be supervised by themasses."102

That was Mao's persistent evaluation of and general attitude toward the cadres,as clearly stated in theSixteen-pointProgram of August 81966,whichbasicallyembodiedMao'sapproachtotheCRoverall.Thecadres,theSixteen-pointProgrampointed out,could roughlybe classified intofour categories:(1)good;(2)comparatively good; (3) those who have made serious mistakes but have not becomeanti-Party, anti-socialist rightists; (4) the small number of anti-Party, anti-socialistrightists. The final goal of the CR, in accordance with Mao's wishes, was to unite 95102MaoZedong,TalkataMting of thCentral ultural RevolutionGroup”dui zhongyangwengexiaozdjianghua),January 9,1967,fromLongLiveMaoZedong Thought(MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,pp.282-83,printedinWuhan,1967-1968.TheEnglishtranslation is modifiedfromChairmanMaoTalkstothePeople,ed.byStuart R.Schram,pp.275-76,Pantheon Books,1974.

313percent of cadres and 95 percent of the masses.13 After a close reading of TheSixteen-pointProgram,AlainBadioualsodiscerned thisstrikingpremisethatunderlaytheCR,

First of all,it is held,as if axiomatically,that inessence the party isgood. Point 8 ("The Question of Cadres") distinguishes four types ofcadres, as put to the test of the Cultural Revolution (let us rememberthat in China, a“cadre”is anyone who dispenses authorities,even ifminimal): good, comparatively good, those who have made seriousmistakes that can be fixed,and lastly“the small number of anti-Partyand anti-socialist Rightists." The thesis is then that “the two firstcategories (good and comparatively good) are the great majority." Thatis, the state apparatus and its internal leadership (the party) areessentially in good hands, which renders paradoxical the recourse tosuch large-scale revolutionary methods.104

For Mao, the party on the whole was good because the problems of mostcadreswerenotrootedintheirclasspositions,butcamefrombeingunder theinfluence of the wrong Liu-Dengist line—following a servile philosophy of“alwaysbeing a tool of the Party"” proposed by Liu Shaoqi in his book “How to be a GoodCommunist."Aslong asthesecadres returned to the correctline ofMarxist-Leninist-Mao Zedong Thought, they could be saved and serve thepeopleagain. Mao insisted on giving these old cadres and revolutionary veterans amplechances tomake revolution and render new contributions again.Mao's comments onWu Lengxi and similar cadres prefigured his attitudes toward the coming ShanghaiCommune.103 See “Decision of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Concerning the Great ProletarianCulturalRevolution(AdoptedonAugust8,1966)"(Zhongguogongchandangzhongyangweiyuanhuiguanyuwuchan jieji wenhua da geming de jueding),in People's Daily,Aug.9,1967,and the English translation is fromPeking Review,Vol.9,No.33,Aug.12,1966,pp.6-11.104 Alain Badiou, “The Cultural Revolution: The Last Revolution?” Positions, 13:3 (2005), p.492.

TheSixteen-pointProgramandMao'sgeneralevaluationof thecadreteambefore the CR, in the eyes of the masses, could also be justified. At least, thecommunist cadres were far better than the corrupt Guomingdang officials twentyyears before.And there did exist a large number of JiaoYulu-style cadres before theCR, who devoted their lives to serve the people.ro This was why there were so manyloyalist and conservative people during the CR, especially during the early stage ofthe CR, who defended the pre-CR order and, concretely speaking, defended thepre-CR cadre team. For example, the Scarlet Guards possibly recruited nearly onemillion members in its heyday, which greatly outnumbered its rival rebels in the lastdays of 1966. This is by no means an exception. Another loyalist workersorganization inWuhan,a big industrial base inHubei Province,claimed torecruitmore than one million workers,hence the name of its faction, the "Million Heroes(baiwan xiongshi)10°. Even if the numbers of "Million Heroes” might be a bitoverstated, it definitely significantly outnumbered any single rebel faction in Wuhanat the time. But in the eyes of the Maoist leaders, the fact that the general cadre teamwas good for the time being could not guarantee it would be good in the future. Maohimselfwasveryworried aboutthepossibleemergenceofKhrushchev-stylehighranking officials in the Center. Once a Chinese Khrushchev took power in the CenterMao believed, China would soon change its color from socialism to capitalism, as hadhappened in the UsSR after Stalin's death. Therefore, to prevent capitalist restorationin China, it was necessary to launch a CR to combat the revisionism embodied in105 See “Revolutionary Leadership: County Party Secretary Chiao Yu-lu", in Peking Review, No. 9, February 25,1966.106 It was offcially formed in May 16, 1967 in Wuhan, with backbone militia jigan minbing) as its core.

315some Chinese cadres,even if the current cadre team was generally good. The ultimateaim of the CR was not to bring down many cadres, but to train capable revolutionarysuccessors, including those cadres who were willing to continue the revolution, and toeducate the masses in how to combat revisionism, especially after the old veteranrevolutionaries passed away. Therefore, Mao himself preferred to call the CR arehearsal for possible future revolutions if the capitalist system was restored in ChinaTo prepare for such revolutions in the future, it was necessary to organize millionsupon millions of masses and move a mighty revolutionary army into action right away.Only a force of such magnitude could crush the revisionists who controlled a majorportion of the state power. In this kind of rehearsal, the masses would get temperedand grow into capable successors for the revolution. That was why the Maoist leadershad to restort to such large-scale revolutionary methods even though the cadre teamswere considered generally good. This seeming paradox is what confused Alain Badiou.But once the masses were widely mobilized, the revolutionary momentum could crushall plans, no matter who had set the agendas. In Shanghai, thanks to the general strikeby the Scarlet Guards and cadres, the original plan to seize power from a handful of“capitalist roaders” set by the Maoist leaders became a full-scale mass take-over fromalmost all thepower holders. TheMaoist leadership inBeijing had toface andacknowledgethenewpoliticallandscape

January 6 saw heavy snow. In the morning more than 10o,000 rebels attendeda huge rally in People's Plaza which was called "Raising High the Great Banner ofMao Zedong's Thought, Thoroughly Bringing Down the SPC Headed by Chen and

Altogether in Shanghaimorethan2millionpeoplewereinvolvedinthisevent at369placeswhereralliestook place. At the main gathering in People's Plaza, Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu werebrought to account for the Kangping Street-Hengshan Hotel Incident. Meanwhile.several hundred upper-middleShanghai cadres were taken onto the platform to accept"accompanying struggle". The rally issued three formal demands. First, a telegramwas sent to the Center and Chairman Mao to request that the old SPC be reorganized.that Mayor Cao be dismissed from office, and that Mayor Cao be denounced by namein Shanghai's newspapers. Cao himself would be ordered to do manual labor underthe rebels' supervision. Second, the rebels said that the first party secretary ChenPixian must write a confession within 7 days to the rebels to make clear how he hadmanipulated the old SPC to oppose Chairman Mao, the CCRG and the CR in general;and that he must disclose his close relationship with the Liu-Dengist headquartersThird, the rebels said that other top officials in Shanghai and the East China Bureau ofCCP must present their confessions to the rebels; during the period of writingconfessions,ifthesetopofficialsdidgooddeedstotheParty andthepeople,thentheir punishments would be reduced. Otherwise, punishments would be doubled.107 Iftherebel takeoverof theWenhuiDailyand theLiberationDailyofficiallystarted thewind of power seizures at the city level in one particular field, then this rally could beseen as a turning point of the January Revolution in Shanghai. After that, the SPC107 The Chorography of the Chinese Communist Pary of Shanghai' Zhonggong Shanghai dangzhi), seehttp://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node4523/node28957/node28967/node60685/userobject1ai13910.html,citedJune28,2009.

317whichhadbeenmanipulating the conservative mass movementwas on the declineand the rebel movement gathered its momentum and strength day by day

At this interim period, even though the authorities of the SPC were stillofficially recognized by the rebels, after the public disgrace of major Shanghai cadresmore and more rebels did not take the old power holders'words seriously.Whenasked by the rebels about how to handle the critical situation at the Shanghai PortChen Pixian still insisted on immediately satisfying the workers’economic demands,if they were reasonable. He even openly declared his full support for salarycompensations for those rebelling for economic reasons. But this time, nobodyobeyed him. Regardless of Chen's objections, the rebels were bound and determinedto take control of the Port. Very soon, all the control rooms were in the hands of rebels,andnoshipswere allowed tosailwithout their permission.Themass takeover of theShanghai Port was a big success for the rebels as it demonstrated that they held powerover production in a key economic unit. And this meant that no other political powerscould use it as an effective weapon to exert pressure on the Center and hold Shanghaicitizens as hostages for political bargaining. The power seizure of the Port partiallyprevented theScarletGuardsfromleavingbysea andput astoptotheoldporiauthorities’generous distribution ofstatefunds.But it could not stop the economistwind and put a stop to the people who were leaving from other parts of the city, e.g.,from river, by railway and public transportation. On January 7, rebels from the WGHandotherrebel organizationssimultaneouslyvisited theShanghaibranch of theChinese People's Bank. United with the rebels working within the bank, they

318negotiatedwith thebankheads,demanding that theynot distributemoneyto anyunitswithout the Center's approval. After the negotiations, a notice was issued to the city,stating that from then on, until further notice from the Center, no banks were allowedto give away salary and welfare compensations; all union outlays, factory funds andcollective funds were to be frozen. The rebels gave all party branches instructions tostrictly enforce these regulations.But contrary to rebels'wishes, some power holdersstill issued big checks and asked for cash from a branch of the People's Bank. In orderto put a stop to this transaction, many rebels from the Inland Navigation Companyrushed to the bank to struggle against the power holders there. On the same day, therebels also stopped an attempt in the Zhabei section of thePeople's Bank to withdraw1,000,000 yuan.108From then on, the flow of cash in the Shanghai's banks was underthe rebels' stern supervision.Even though they had not yet seized power from the oldpower holders in the banks, the rebels were able to supervise all the bank transactionsIn the past, this kind of power was unimaginable for the common workers. Tellinglythe rebels began to control the economic lifelines of Shanghai.109 The same day, theWGH's paper Rebel Workers'News brought out an article entitled "Never Allow theMain Direction of the Struggle to be Diverted",which pointed out that the SPC led byChen and Cao had tried to shift the main direction of the masses’ struggle frompolitical to economic, egging on the masses to rebel only for pure economic reasons,not for serious political causes.108 Jjingjizhanxian shang deyichang zhengzhizhan (A Political Fight at the Economic Batefront,in Zhibushenghuo (Life in Party Branches), No.4, Jan 25,1967.Ed.by the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of Zhibushenghuo,Shanghai.p.28..109See Workers'Rebel News (Gongren zaofan bao),edited by the Shanghai WGH, January 12,1968.

To address the pressing challenge of economic disorder,,theWGH and someRed Guards student organizations held a joint emergency meeting the night of January8 to discuss how to rescue Shanghai from paralysis. They unanimously agreed to forma coordinated group consisting of rebel forces in major work units in Shanghai torecover production. The same night immediately after the meeting, rebelrepresentatives from the railway, port, post office, communication and transportationservices, the Long River Shipping Company, and the Ocean Shipping Bureauconvened at the Shanghai Custom Building to set up an city-wide economic powerorgan called "Frontline Headquarters of Grasping Revolution and PromotingProduction in Shanghai." The “Frontline Headquarters" was composed of 7 workers,2 cadres, and 35 Red Guards. They jointly took the view that an important task forrebels was to be model workers themselves at this critical moment and they tried topersuade theconservativeworkers togoback to theirmachines.

Rebel students and teachers were fully mobilized to go to stations, wharves,factories and other places to do the propaganda work of “grasping revolution andpromoting production." Due to the shortage of manpower, many students went to domanuallaborsassubstitutesfortheworkerswhohadwalkedoffthejob.Manydidsoeven before January 4 when the issue of the newspaper that had the Message to AllShanghai People came out.l1o The propaganda campaign launched againsteconomism by rebel workers and students was overwhelming and their messages ofopposing economism were taken out to almost every corner of Shanghai.

320Shanghai Slide Fastener Factory, for example, rebel workers put up many postersOne poster read: *The system is unreasonable and needs to be overthrown, and rebelfor oneself is not right."Another stated:"Whenever we demand welfarefrom thepower holders, they are more than pleased to sign. In fact they took advantage of ourmental backwardness toserve themselves,and madeuse of thedeceived togetrid oftheir enemies, thus endangering the CR." And the third declared: "We have betterwages than peasants, but now the power holders want to compensate us several ten orhundred yuan per person. Their aim is to break the alliance of workers and peasants."Three old rebel workers at the No. 5 District of the Shanghai Wharf composed abig-character poster titled "Disclose the Arch-scheme of the SPC" that proclaimed:"We want socialism, not the stinking money from Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu.'1This was aimed at educating workers to not accept money even though the powerholders were ready to make offers.Meanwhile, the walls near the banks were fullycovered with posters such as "Put politics, not money in command,”"To makerevolution is not for money," “When you receive compensational cash, you are caughtwith chaff.112 This kind of appeal had a huge influence over the workers as, inessence,“it was an appeal to the better instincts of those who had been deceived bygifts of money and privileges."'113 In this campaign, many workers returned theirwindfallsbackto thestate.To counter thenationwidecrisisof thewind ofeconomismon January 9,the“Messageto All Shanghai People”was reprinted in thePeople'sIl SeJaryS,jnt isufN.n6,edbytGHShanhai112 SeeLong Live theVictory of the Great January Revolution”(Yiyue geming shengli wansui),WorkersRebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),Jan.12,1968.113 Neale Hunter 1969,p.223.

At present, when the great proletarian cultural revolution inShanghaiisenteringthemomentofdecisivebattlebetweenthetwolines, when the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, whichstubbornly clings to thebourgeoisreactionaryline,isbeing defeatedthe handful of persons in the Party who are in authorities and aretaking the capitalist road are once again hatching new schemes.Colludingwith the capitalist forces in society,they are making use ofeconomicbenefitstodivertthegeneral orientationof thestruggle andto incite one group of people against another, causing breakdowns infactory production and railway and road traffic.They have even inciteddockers to stop work, causing difficulties in running the port anddamaging the international prestige of China.They are making freewith the state's money and property, arbitrarily increasing wages andmaterial benefits, and granting all kinds of allowances and subsidieswithout limit, stirring people up to take over public buildings byforce.These are the latest forms under which the Shanghai Municipal PartyCommittee perseveres in carrying out the bourgeois reactionary line

In resorting to such base and treacherous means, the handfulof persons in theParty who are in authorities and are taking thecapitalist road aim at none other than:(1)Setting themselves againstChairman Mao and the Party's Central Committee, and puttingpressure ontheCultural Revolution Groupunder theParty'sCentralCommittee, by sabotaging production, interrupting communicationsandjeopardizing thenationaleconomyandthelivelihoodof thepeopletoattaintheirpurposeofunderminingthegreatproletarianculturalrevolution; 2)Making use of economicbenefits to divert the generalorientation of the struggle in the attempt to turn the serious politicalstruggle into an economic struggle, and at the same time to corrupt therevolutionary will of the masses by material gains, and to promotepeaceful evolution and allowbourgeois ideas torun riot.

To get Shanghai out of its paralysis and back to operating normally, thisUrgent Notice included a ten-point proposal that directly addressed current problems.Thekey principle it emphasized—which was in fact stipulated by the Center—wasthat"To avoid shifting the general orientation of the struggle, matters related to thereadjustment of wages, back payment of wages, and material benefits, shall inprinciple be dealt with at a later stage of the movement (special cases shall be handledotherwise after asking the central authorities for instructions).li5 This time, therebels had more venues by which they could give voice for their new appeal, as thetwo largest Shanghai newspapers Wenhui Daily and Liberation Daily had alreadybeen taken over and was now under their control. Moreover, just two days later, onJanuary11,a congratulatory telegram“Message of Greetings toRevolutionary RebelOrganizations in Shanghai'", signed jointly by the Central Committee, the StateCouncil, the Military Committee and the CCRG, was sent from Beijing, praising the114 See “Urgent Notice” (Jinji tonggao) in Wenhi Daily, Jan.9, 1967, its English version “32 ShanghaiRevolutionary Rebel Organizations Issue“Urgent Notice'" is from Peking Review, No. 4, January 20, 1967.115Ibid.

The time was finally ripe for greatsocietal changes.

As theSixteen-pointProgram suggested,itwas necessary to“dismiss fromtheir leadingposts all thosein authorities who are takingthecapitalistroad and somake possible the recapture of the leadership for the proletarian revolutionaries.*118 Awave of mass takeovers of power surged throughout Shanghai in January.

It not only effectively prevented any further exodus of theScarlet Guards by train, but also saved the greater Shanghai region from economicdevastation. Right after the power seizure, 5 freight trains fully loaded with coal, werearranged to set off to the power plant for generating the much needed electricity fonthe whole city in the cold, snowing winter.

326ChapterFive:TheRiseoftheShanghaiCommune

TheDualPower in theJanuaryStorm

After the rebel workers took over, they were empowered and had endlessenthusiasm for labor and production. For example, two teams at the port wereunloading a cargo ship full of coal, the major source of energy for the city. Afterstudying Mao quotations and discussing security issues and technical procedures, theylaunched a friendly campaign of socialist competition to promote model workers. As aresult,the twoteams,evenwith the absence of more than twentyScarletGuardworkers,successfully unloaded10,866 tons of coal and delivered it to the designatedcoal field -6 hours ahead of schedule. On January 16, with a new, revolutionarypower in charge, rebel workers in the No.2 converter workshop at the Shanghai SteelMill strove to promote production and they dramatically increased their daily output1.8 times. By the middle of January, the loading and unloading amount of cargo atShanghai wharves, where there was still a shortage of capable workers, reached morethan 80,000 tons per day -which was close to the normal rate. OnJanuary 18, therebels at Shanghai's Yanshupu Power Plant seized control of production, ensuring thefunctioning of the whole city. And by January 19, the Shanghai railway system, afterthe mass takeover, recovered its operations with 22 trains departing from Shanghaievery day. This was equal to what railway transportation had been before the CR in

327Shanghai.

At this moment, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and other rebel leaders inShanghai were seriously thinking of establishing a kind of power organ as the highestpower entity to replace the nominally still existing SPC. On January 12, in celebrationof the congratulatory telegram “Message of Greetings to Revolutionary RebelOrganizations in Shanghai”from the Center, the Shanghai rebels held a mammothrally to pledge resolute and mass efforts in “smashing the new counteroffensive of thebourgeois reactionary line." At this rally, a proposal to form a city-wide revolutionaryrebels' liaison post, which would consist of various Shanghai rebel organizations andout-of-town rebel organizations stationed in Shanghai, was officially passed. Thepurpose of this"Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Organizations'Liaison Post",according to the proposal, was to "help to understand, learn, and support each otheramong rebel organizations" and to“strengthen the solidarity and fight together basedon theMao Zedong thought."Actually, it aimed to replace the old SPC with a neworganizational form. Apparently, the Maoist leadership in Beijing had highexpectationsfor theproposed"ShanghaiRevolutionaryRebel Organizations'LiaisonPost", as the official New China's News Agency released the complete text of thisproposal to the whole country the next day.

The next ten or so days did see frequent and intensive negotiations amongvarious rebel organizations about the establishment of these kinds of liaison posts.1See Weida de yiyue geming shengli wansui (“Long Live the Victory of the Great January Revolution"), fromWorkers'RebelNews (Gongren zaofan bao),by the WGH,Jan.18,1968.2NewChina’sNewsAgency,Jan.12,1967,Guanyu jianli Shanghai shi geming zaofanpai zuzhilianluozhandechangyi(AProposalofSetting upShanghaiRevolutionaryRebelOrganizations'LiaisonPost),inNingboMasses(Ningbodazhong),Jan.14,1967.

328Led by theWGH, a“Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Workers'LiaisonDepartment"which consisted of 15 rebel workers'organizations, was set up around January 16,1967.3 Unfortunately, the bigger “Liaison Post" based on the broadest unity amongrebel factions, including all rebel students, workers, peasants and functionaries inShanghaiwasnotestablishedbecauseofinternalconflictsamongvariousfactionsUnder such circumstances, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan and other rebel leadersplayed a mediating role among various rebel factions and had to strengthen theexisting functional joint rebel power organ functioning mainly in the economic andproduction sphere-- the Frontline Headquarters of Grasping Revolution andPromoting Production. The night of January 19, Zhang Chunqiao met with rebelrepresentatives from six major bureaus and some responsible persons from theFrontline Headquarters of Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production. Zhangpraised the Frontline Headquarters as a big miracle and an economic soviet, andinformed the representatives that hehad already told ChairmanMao about it FrontlineHeadquarters. The representatives were confident that they were ready to helpestablish a power structure at the city level. After the meeting, assisted by theFrontlineHeadquarters,theCommitteeofDefendingtheGreatProletarianRevolution,which consisted of representatives from 12 rebel organizations, was formed. Itfunctioned, the Committee proclaimed, to "take part in receiving and mediatingdisputes between two factions in factories, enterprises, and schools, and oversee3Shanghai gongren geming zaofan zongsilingbu deng shiwuge tuanti zucheng Shanghai gongren gemingzaofanpailianluobu(TheWGHandOther14OrganizationsFormedtheShanghaiRevolutionaryRebelWorkersLiaisonDepartment),inShanghaiWanbao(ShanghaiEveningNews),January16,1967.

329city-level rallies and maintain law and order.*4 Clearly, it meant to replace Shanghai'sold public security organs, procuratorial organs as well as the people's courts, that is,the policing organs in general. Efforts to set up the "Shanghai Revolutionary RebelOrganizations' Liaison Post"which would include all the rebel factions in Shanghaihad not been successful. And eventually, the coming new power organ would take theshape of the Shanghai Commune based on an alliance that included many, but not alloftherebelfactions.

Around the time of the January Revolution, there was dual political power inShanghai. When talking about the Russian revolution of March 1917, Lenin writes,

Themainfeature of our revolution, a feature that mostimperativelydemands thoughtful consideration,is the dual power which arose in theveryfirstdays after thetriumphof therevolution.Thisdualpower isevident in the existence of two governments: one is the main, the real,the actual government of the bourgeoisie, the "ProvisionalGovernment" of Lvov and Co., which holds in its hands all the organsof power; the other is a supplementary and parallel government, a"controlling" government in the shape of the Petrograd Soviet ofWorkers' and Soldiers' Deputies, which holds no organs of state power,but directly rests on the support of an obvious and indisputablemajority of the people, on the armed workers and soldiers.

Amid the January Revolution in Shanghai, there also existed a similar dualpower: one was the old SPC, which still nominally held the Shanghai local stateapparatus in its hands - even though it had been greatly discredited by the disgruntledrebelsbecause of the oppressive activities ithad carried out against themass4 The Chorography of the Chinese Communist Party of Shanghai" Zhongong Shanghai dangzhi),seehttp://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node4523/node28957/node28967/node60685/userobject1ai13910.html,citedJuly8,2009.5 V. 1.

330movement and had reportedly "completely collapsed" at the huge struggle rally onJanuary 6, 1967.° Just as Chen Pixian recalled in his memoir about the mammothstruggle meeting against major top cadres of Shanghai on January 6: “No matter howthe rebels declared to^dismiss’us from ^posts', before the official order of dismissalannounced by the Center, I was still a leader of Shanghai, the first party secretary ofthe SPC who was supposed to take charge of Shanghai's affairs."7Sincetherebelshad no direct access to state funds, and were keeping Mao's words “"be frugal to makerevolution" in mind, they needed financial subsides from time to time.And they hadto seek permission from the old bureaucrats to get funds.A former Red Guard inFudan University, Cao Weiping, recollected that amid the wind of economism, the“dismissed" deputy Party secretary Wang Ling, who still worked in Fudan, hadprovided his signature to people for the distribuion of funds. Pointing to the fact thatpeople could still get money from the Finance Office of Fudan University with WangLung's signature, some said that the officials of the Fudan Party committee had notactually been dismissed.And more generally, the proclaimed “dismissal" of theShanghai mayors and Party secretaries at the January 5 rally was not thoroughly andseriously enforced -for example the seals symbolizing power remained in the handsof the old power holders.* The two most important documents opposing economismweretheMessagetoAllShanghaiPeopleand theUrgentNotice.Therebelswhohaddrafted this hoped it was being fully followed by all workers under the instructions of6YaoWenyuan,Qingkuang jianbao(A rief Report of Situation), quoted fromWang Nianyi,Da dongluan deniandai(Turbulent Decade),Zhengzhou:Henan renmin chubanshe,1988,p.173.7SeeChenPixian2005,p.132.8CaoWeiping,PingXu laosan shi nian yi meng(Comments on Xu laosan's “TenYears A Dream"),seehttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=2614 cited on Dec. 5, 2009.

331everyParty branch in Shanghai. To reach this goal, the rebels insisted that ChenPixian sign them on behalf of the discredited SPC. Before the CR, all major provincialtop cadres were not directly elected by local citizens, but were instead appointed bythe Center, mainly the Central Committee of the CCP and the state council. ThereforeChen Pixian and his colleagues had reason to treat themselves as power holdersregardless of the rebels'oral or written“dismissal".As a matter of fact, it was notuntil January 16 that Mao Zedong ratified the seizure of power from the old Shanghaiauthorities.” Generally speaking, the Maoists in the Center repeatedly stressed theimportance of the “mass line". But out of strong belief in the Party itself, many cadresinsisted on being responsible to their direct leaders, that is, they were following avertical organizational line.But when their direct leaders or someleaders in theCenter were not Maoists and did not serve the people, following a verticalorganizationalline meant that theywould endupignoring thepeople's interestsDuring all the CR years, most cadres held such a deep-rooted belief that "I wouldrather make political than organizational errors." If one cadre erred in the political line.so long as his direct leaders protected him, things would be fine in terms of hispolitical career.Butifheerredinterms of organizationalline,thecadrewould bedegraded or even expelled from the partyfor good.

The other pole of the dual power structure in Shanghai's January Revolutionwastherebels'organizationalcreation.Aftertheformationofthreecrucial“controlling” power organs, that is, the “Frontline Headquarters of Grasping9Wang Nianyi, Da dongluan de niandai (Turbulent Decade), Zhengzhou: Henan renmin chubanshe, 1988,p.178.

Many shifted their stand and joined the rebel ranks. Maowasverypleased tofind that from the end of 1966 totheJanuaryRevolution,thenumber of Shanghai rebels grew tremendously - from only several thousand to overone million. In the middle of January, self-proclaimed rebels already outnumbered thedisheartened loyalist workers. In fact, at this point, the Scarlet Guards as an actualworkers’faction was totally disintegrated. Many of the Scarlet Guards sincerely orinsincerely joined the rebels.Others could only pack their armbands and hide theirtrue political stance, waiting and seeking out a chance to counterattack. Even thoughloyalist workers had to give up the organizational title of the “Scarlet Guards", someloyalist leaders claimed they would resume the title when the time was ripe.1° Andstill others just lost any interests in political activities and faded into the backgroundof history.Consequently,compared with the old SPC,the other side of the dual powerthe rebel's power, as “a supplementary and parallel government", appeared to bemuch more solid, more “controlling” and authoritative. This was because theShanghai rebels “directly rested on the support of an obvious and indisputablemajority of the people, on the armed workers and soldiers," - just as Lenin had10 Yong xianxue he shengming baowei Shanghai renmin gongshe (Defend the Shanghai People's Commune withBlood and Life),in Dongfanghong (East Is Red),Feb.14,1967,ed.by Mao Zedong sixiang hongweibingShanghai shi dongfanghong zongbu and Tongji daxue dongfanghong bingtuan.

333characterized theworkers'government oftheRussianrevolutioninMarch1917.During the January Revolution, whatever the Shanghai rebel government asked forfrom the SPC, the latter had no other choice but to cooperate.

The class nature of the workers’ power organs in the January revolution, inaccordance with Lenin's analysis, was an entity of working class self-governance thatemerged mostly from workers' creativity, spontaneity, and initiatives, rather than frominstructions from Beijing. This was especially so in the first days of the JanuaryRevolutionwhen rebel workers took the initiative,In theface of a difficult situation inwhich theloyalist workers had walked out of the factories, the rebels promotedproduction under the severe conditions of labor shortages; they consciously opposedeconomism to"defend socialism";and they elected their own committeebased on theParis Commune model to take care of production and revolution. As the revolutionwent on, the Maoist leadership in Beijing, and Zhang Chunqiao, who was a top cadrein local authorities as well as a commissar from the CCRG, intervened and got moreandmoreinvolved.Sometimestheseinvolvementsandinterventionswereconstructive and worked in cooperation with the rebel movement inShanghai.Butsometimestheywerenot.Eventhoughtheotherpoleofdualpower,theSPC,wasregarded by the rebels as executing a “bourgeois reactionary line,”" no one at that timecalled it a completely"bourgeois government".According to the Sixteen-pointProgram, most of the cadres acting in line with Liu-Dengist policies were still good.as they were acting, not from their true class positions,but from an incorrectunderstanding of Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and state affairs. When

334therealrevolutionunfolded,however,this assessmentof theoldcadreteamsstirredupintensedebates amongrebels.Someinsisted thattheoldgovernmentwasbourgeois in nature, and hence deserved tobe thoroughly toppled over, while othersbelieved that most cadres were still curable, and what the rebels needed to do wasempowering the workers themselves to supervise the“rectification andre-revolutionization" of the cadres. In this regard, whatever the case, according to therebels and Maoist leadership in Beijing, the old Shanghai power organ had to bedramatically reformed and reorganized. But as there were not many Shanghai leadingcadres who openly expressed support for the rebels, the reformist plan to re-organizetheoldSPChadtobere-considered.

As Lenin stated, “the dual power merely expresses a transitional phase in therevolution's development,*1l - and one power organ between the two poles had to beeliminated. For the January Revolution in Shanghai, a brand new organizational formof state power modeled upon theParis Commune of 1871 would soon be created.That was the Shanghai People's Commune (Shanghai Commune for short).Nonetheless, even after the January Storm and the formation of the ShanghaiCommune at thebeginning of the next month, a lot of power was still not in therebel'shands.Preciselybecauseof thissituation,theManifestoof theShanghaiCommune called for waging a campaign of further power seizures.12

The Shanghai rebels did not consider forming the Commune on a mere whim.To a significant extent, there was consensus among rebels throughout the country in11 V. I. Lenin 1964, p.61.12 See Jiefang ribao (Liberation Daily),Feb.7, 1967.

335terms of the commune as an ideal. This had been inspired by Mao and his disciplesfrequent and glowing references to the Paris Commune before and after the CR ( Ifwe trace things further back, we find that the commune was in fact a dream amongChinese revolutionaries even since the 1920s). But the road to Shanghai Commune, aswewillsee,wouldbelongand arduous.

Due to the Shanghai cadres' huge strike, the rebels had to launch waves ofmass takeovers on their own initiative. The rebels controlled some crucial sectors ofsociety after the initial and partial power seizures. But as time wore on, and theeconomiccrisisdeepened,thedebateaboutthenatureof theoldSPC,and aboutwhich cadres deserved to be labelled as true capitalist roaders, became more and moreirrelevant. The key issue of the struggle changed to the normal operation of the city.Obviously, in order to save Shanghai from collapse, a new rebel power organ at thecity level had to be formed while at the same time, the existing SPC had to becompletely taken over. At this point, some top Maoist leaders in Beijing worried aboutthe wholesale takeover of the old state apparatus in Shanghai. On January 15, at a"Grasp Revolution and Promote Production" rally attended by Beijing and provincialrevolutionary organizations, Chen Boda, the director of the CCRG, said that lettingrebels stage mass takeovers of factories was a new trick of capitalist roaders.Thereasoningofferedherewasthatthesecretagendabehind thesetakeoverwasembarassing the rebels when they failed to lead and manage production. So Chensuggested that it was better for the rebels to supervise existing units than to take themover. He emphasized that in some cases it was fine to carry out takeovers, but not on

336a largescale,because this wouldend upswallowing thebait of the capitalist roadersAt the same rally,Premier Zhou Enlai also warned against mass takeover and said hepreferred tohavethe oldcadresof Shanghaisupervised by therebelsin order tostabilize production.'” Even though Mao advocated the idea of“getting rid of thestale and taking in the fresh' (tugunaxin) and hoped to dispose of the so-calledcapitalist roaders within existing establishments whilekeepingrevolutionary cadreson their posts, he himself admitted that for the masses it was hard to tell who shouldbe struggle objects in peacetime, and the rebels had no way to tell who were truecapitalist roaders and who were not. Mao did not clearly state that many existingestablishments should be toppled. But he might anticipate that large scale powerwould become inevitable. Learning that Chen Boda and Zhou Enlai discouraged masstakeovers, immediately after the rally, Mao called for a meeting to criticize ChenBoda and make it clear that he openly favored power seizures. Without delay, Mao'sviewpoints were expressed and incorporated by Wang Li and Guan Feng, twomembers of the CCRG,into an article.Titled,“Proletarian Revolutionaries,Unite!this commentary praised Shanghai's experiences of seizing power and was publishedin the Red Flag the next day. Although their experiences were manifold, the focalpoint, according to the article, was that the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries unitedtoseizepower from a handful of personswithin theParty authorities whowere takingthe capitalist road, thus firmly holding and taking the political, economic and cultural13See “Speeches by Zhou Enlai and Chen Boda at the Rally of Beijing and Provincial Revolutionary Organizationsto‘Grasp Revolution and Promote Production"(Zhou Enlai Chen Boda zai shoudu he waidi zaijing gemingzaofantuantizhuagemingcushengchandahuishangdejianghua),inSpeechesof theCentral Leaders(Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua), Vol.1,ed. by the Red Guard Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March,1967.

337power of Shanghai municipality into their own hands.14

This was, in fact, the first public official document in which Mao openlycalled for power seizures based on the ongoing events. The Sixteen-point Programhad granted permission to “dismiss from their leading posts all those in authoritieswho are taking the capitalist road and so make possible the recapture of the leadershipfor the proletarian revolutionaries". But it still limited the extent that some cadrescould recapture power.1? The mass-initiated power seizures from below driven by anda result of the struggles between the rebels and the emerging bureaucratist class, thatis, the so-called capitalist roaders, were endorsed by Mao. The main experiences ofShanghai, this commentary emphasized, were that the proletarian revolutionaries ofShanghai formed a great alliance to seize power from the capitalist roaders, and werethus able to establish a new order of the great proletarian revolution.As the previouspower shift that had taken place inShanghai had been partial, only involvingsomemajor departments and units, this characterization in the article had the propagandaeffect of encouraging further rebel actions. For all practical purposes, the power of theold SPC had already been taken over by the rebels' spontaneous actions as thediscreditedpower holders could notfreelywield their power asbefore.And majonofficials, such as Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu, were taken into custody by some rebelfactions after the rally of "Shanghai Revolutionary Rebel Hailing the CongratulatoryTelegram from the Center and Thoroughly Smashing the New Counteroffensive of theBourgeois Reactionary Line" on January 12. But the old SPC had not actually been14 See “Proletarian Revolutionaries, Unite!"(Wuchan jieji geming pai lianhe qilai), Hongqi (Red Flag), 1967, No.2,and its English translation can be found at Peking Review,No.4，p.15.January 20,1967.JSee Wang Li, Wang Li's Reflections (Wang Li fansi lu), pp.595-99, Hongkong: Beixing chubanshe, 2001.

338abolished-therebelsdidnothavetherighttodothisandhadtowaitfor approvaland permission from Beijing. In other words, the old Shanghai government stillexisted, at least in form. Moreover, some “controlling” power organs did come intobeing as entities of the dual power system. But the established new order of the greatproletarian revolution was far from stable. It was just transitional and temporary andsometimes could not exert strong leadership in the turbulent chaos. Last but not least,in the face of the old power holders and their gruesome conservative supporters, allthe rebels managed to unite together and bring down their common enemies. Butonce the obvious enemies were defeated and had surrendered, discrepancies anddivergences among different rebel factions loomed larger and larger. In fact aroundthe time that the Red Flag article appeared on January 16, the once united greatalliance that had seized power from the old power holders fell apart.

The disintegration of the rebels’ solidarity, as will be discussed below, waspartially due to the oldSPC's deliberate manipulation and sabotage of themovement.During the transitional period of dual power in Shanghai, even though the old SPCwas seriously discredited and in the process of gradually falling, it still commanded agreat deal of sympathy from the skilled and model workers and common citizens.What is more, the old SPC had many experienced and trusted cadres who knew howto run a government smoothly, [and how to purposely let a government down—whatdoes this mean??]. Most of the skilled workers and experienced cadres, under theinfluence of the old SPC, chose not to cooperate with the rebels. Some others, eventhough they joined the rebel ranks after the debacle of the Scarlet Guards and even

339actedasupper-middleleadersintherebelfactions,thenshowedtheirtruecolorsbyactively opposing theformation of theWGH-led newpower organ,thatis,theShanghai Commune. Compared to the old SPC, the proposed new power organ by therebels was still in its infancy and needed to be explored and take further shape

The Split, Internecine Struggles and Anti-Zhang Campaign: The

TortuousRoad to theShanghai Commune

As early as January 1,1967,the People's Daily and the Red Flag's jointeditorialCarrytheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolutionThroughtotheEndprescribed guidelines for the new year that identified the proletariat, namely, the rebelworkers as the main power player -while other“revolutionary masses,” such as rebelstudents, should play the role of supporters of the working class in the CR. It clarified,

All cultural revolution movements in contemporary Chinese historyhavebegunwith student movements andled to theworker and peasantmovements,to theintegration of revolutionary intellectuals with theworker-peasant masses. This is an objective law. This was true of theMay Fourth Movement which marked the beginning of China'scontemporary history of revolution and is true also of the greatproletarian cultural revolution which hasbrought the country's socialistrevolution to a new stage. In 1967, China's great proletarian culturalrevolution will continue to develop in line with this objective law.

But it seemed that many rebel students in Shanghai did not understand whatwas indicated in this editorial.The editorial expressed thehope that rebels studentswould assist rebelworkers.But thethreelargest andoldestrebelRed Guard16 Quoted from Peking Review, No. 1, January 1, 1967.

340organizations in Shanghai, the Red Revolutionaries,Bombarding Headquarters,andRed Third Headquarters, positioned themselves as stubborn opponents of ZhangChunqiao, who played a pivotal role in mediating the relationship between theShanghai rebels and the Maoist leadership in Beijing in all-round class struggles andpower seizure in the January Storm and later in the operation of the ShanghaiCommune. These three largest rebel student organizations naturally did not get alongwith the WGH, the oldest and largest city-wide rebel workers' organization whichfirmly backed Zhang Chunqiao and saw him as a revolutionary cadre whosymbolically embodied Chairman Mao's leadership in the Shanghai CR.f7 Moreover,the bitter opponents of Zhang Chunqiao and the WGH-led rebel forces were by nomeans limited to the three Red Guard groups. Immediately after the collapse of theconservativeScarlet Guards,internal conflicts among rivals of therebelworkers ranall the way through the preparation and operation of the new power organ. The road totheShanghaiCommunewastortuous.

Asmentionedabove,theRedFlagarticle"ProletarianRevolutionariesUnite!" acknowledged that the Shanghai rebels had already seized power from theSPCbeforethestatementwasreleasedonJanuary16.Buttheoldpowerstructurestillexisted and needed to be actually and officially taken over at the city level. The articlealso referred to theShanghai rebels as awhole.But therewas a question of whoshould get the biggest share in the new power organ that was being formed? Many7A typical case of conflicts between organizations of rebel students and rebel workers during the period of powerseizures took place in Sichuan.With the backing of the military forces,the rebel students’organization“8.15"based in ChongqingUniversity took powerfrom the old power holdersyet theyexcluded the largest rebel workersorganization “Rebel to the End” from entering into the new power organ. The armed fightings between the tworebel organizations was among thebloodiest during the CR.Compared to Sichuan,similar conflicts among rebelsinShanghai during the same period were somild that they could almost be considered insignificant.

341rebelforces thoughtthat sincethey contributed alot inpastbattles,theywerejustifiedin taking initiative to gain more control in the new power structure. Therefore, rightbefore and after theRed Flag announced and legitimized thevictory of the seizure ofpower from the old Shanghai authorities, Shanghai saw at least five more attempts ofpower seizures at the citylevel carried out by different rebel forces.

In the middle of January, truckloads of rebels, from a contingent of small rebe.organizations, led by an obscure “Worker Rebel Eighth Headquarters", drove into thecourtyard of the SPC locatedat Kangping Street.They soon occupied all thedepartments except for the rooms containing archives and confidential materials andthen proclaimed a takeover of the city government.Upon learning of this,ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyao had Xu Jingxian, the head of the Revolutionary RebelLiaison Centre of Organizations of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, call theleader of “Worker Rebel Eighth Headquarters". Xu Jingxian simply passed Zhang andYao's message on, telling the “Worker Rebel Eighth Headquarters" that since they didnot negotiate with major rebel groups about their actions in advance, they had no righttotakeeovertheold1government. Accordingly, the“Worker Rebel EighthHeadquarters" had to withdraw their forces from the Kangping Street. In this way, thefirst attempt to take the city's power ended up as an abortive one.18

On the early morning of January 15, members from the Shanghai Red GuardThirdHeadquarters'were joined by the “Second Corps of Shanghai Workers18 Xu Jingxian, Ten Years a Dream (Shi nian yi meng), p.47. Hongkong: Shidai guoji chuban youxian gongsi,2003.19 The Shanghai Red Guard Third Headquarters (Shanghai third headquarters [shang san si] for short) wasfounded on December 20, 1966 when it split from the Third Headquarters of Shanghai's Red Guards (Red ThirdHeadquarters [hong san si] for short). An Wenjiang from Fudan University was the head of the Red Third

342Returned From the North" (Second Corps for short) led by its determined leader GengJinzhang. These rebels rushed into building of the SPC, Shanghai People's Committee.and the East China Bureau of the CCPwhich was in charge of party affairs of 5provinces and the Shanghai city in Eastern China. With this raid, the rebels soonannounced that they have sucessfully seized power from the SPC. They sent atelegram of congratulations to Chairman Mao and the Center, asking for Beijing'srecognition and proposing Zhang Chunqiao as the first and Yao Wenyuan as thesecond party secretary of the new Shanghai government. Their move got support from11 other small organizations, such as the Shanghai Liaison Centre of the Red RebelRegiment of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute, some of whose members hadparticipated in this action. Afterward, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan wanted totalk with them. But Zhao Quanguo, from the Shanghai Drama Institute and the majonleader of the Shanghai Red Guard Third Headquarters, and four other student leadershad already taken a flight to Beijing to announce the good news to Chairman Mao andtheCenter.Zhang andYaohad tonegotiatewith rebelworkersfrom theSecond Corpsand pointed out that a seizure of power of the old government by only two bigorganizations did not represent the majority of Shanghai rebels; and that if theyinsisted on taking power as such, then who else would follow their orders? Zhang andYao argued that it would be much better to seize power under the banner of greatalliance of all the rebels.2° Without anticipating such a difficult situation, the SecondHeadquarters.20According to Xu Jingxian’recollection, Zhang Chunqiao asked only Geng Jinzhang to meet with him and didnot negotiate with Zhao Quanguo, the student leader. After Geng Jinzhang had been persuaded to withdraw hisrebel forcesfrom thepremises of official establishments,ZhaoQuanguoand his rebelstudentforces wereisolated.Unsatisfiedwith this arrangement,ZhaoQuanguo andfour other students took aflight toBeijing tolodge a

343Corps had to leave the SPC's premises and agreed not topublicize theirannouncement of the seizure of power in Shanghai. After the workers withdrew, therebel studentshadtogiveup theirplan aswell

When recounting this scenario several months later, Zhang Chunqiao madefun of the second power seizure by the Shanghai Red Guard Third Headquarters andits worker alles, saying that they merely captured some telephones with this move.21But Zhao Quanguo's telegram did reach Mao. Upon receiving the congratulatorytelegram from the Shanghai Third Headquarters, Mao himself did not express hisopinion of thisparticular powerseizure,buthepraised theway ofnominatingnewShanghai leaders by the masses from below, as the Shanghai Third Headquarter haddone." In Beijing, Zhao Quanguo and his fellow rebels did not seem to have strongsupport.But when they learned that the People's Daily would release an editorialsupportingthecaptureofpower asthegeneralorientationof strugglefor thewholecountry, they felt that their action of seizing power would be justified. Therefore, afterflying back to Shanghai, they began to distribute leaflets in the city, claiming that theyhad been received by Zhou Enlai and the CCRG director Chen Boda who supportedtheir actions and given them a four-point instruction. Later, this was proved to be aforgery and Zhang Chunqiao said that he called the premier and Chen Boda severaltimes every day and never heard of such an instruction from his superiors.23complaint. This is different from Zhang Chunqiao's narrative.

Nevertheless,on January 22, in the company of some small rebel groups, theShanghai Third Headquarters, led by Zhang Quanguo, occupied the premises of someofficial establishments at the Kangping Street. They again, proclaimed the officialtakeover of the SPC. This time, however, no major rebel workers’factions took part inthis action. The same day, a joint meeting, proposed by the “Frontline Headquarters ofGrasping Revolution and Promoting Production", was held at Yuqing Road RestHouse at Lane 152, Kangping Street. The meeting, which included the WGH as itscore and rebel leaders from dozens of major revolutionary organizations in Shanghaidiscussed the formation of an all city rebel organizations' liaison center on thecondition that all participating organizations could form a great alliance. If thissucceeded, it could become the new supreme organ of power in Shanghai. Learningthat Zhao Quanguo's faction seized power again, the joint meeting called ZhaoQuanguo to attend the meeting to negotiate the formation of great alliance.Butunexpectantly, Zhao Quanguo announced that he would not go to the meeting. AndZhao also said that all the rebel organizations should go to his place, that is, the oldcity hall - as it was his organization that had led the power seizure - to hold anothermeeting to discuss related issues. Enraged by this response, Pan Guoping, thechairperson of the meeting and major director of the WGH, jumped up and cried:"This guy wrecked the joint power seizure of the Shanghai rebels, and last year heeven tried to convene a rebel rally of all the six provinces and Shanghai in EasternChina...he forged Premier Zhou's instruction...Let's go for him! The meeting was1967,from East Is Red Battle News (Dongfang hong zhanbao),no.104,Nov. 3,1967,ed.by the PoliticalDepartment of the East Is Red Agricultural University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province.

345adjourned and attendees from scores of rebel organizations,includingrebelleadersfrom the“Revolutionary Committee in Public Security Sectors"within Shanghai'spolice system, drove all the way into the compound of the official establishments atKangping Street. Predictably, Zhao Quanguo was seized and sent to the publicsecurity bureau.' The third power seizure was thus ended.

On January 23, the joint meeting at Yuqing Road Rest House resumed. Theattendees unanimously agreed that the situation in Shanghai was favorable and thetime was right for a further move. This was because, first of all, the rebirth of WenhuiDaily and Liberation Daily enabled theShanghai rebels to have two powerfulideological weapons. Secondly, the founding of the “Frontline Headquarters ofGrasping Revolution and Promoting Production" insured that the rebels would put astop to the spate of economism and general strikes instigated by the power holdersand conservative workers - thus preventing Shanghai from running out of dailysupplies. Thirdly, a great number of rebel workers had seized power from powerholders at various government levels and all this laid a solid foundation for the rebelsto form a supreme organ of power at the city level.25 Wang Hongwen believed thattargeting and attacking the handful of capitalist roaders within the party requiredstrong unity among the Shanghai rebels based on Mao Zedong's thought. Naturallyall the representatives reached a consensus in forming a city-level power organ basedon the broadest unity of all proletarian factions. As for what the new power organshould be called, there were many names proposed. Some suggested the General24 Xu Jingxian, 2003. pp.57-58.25Yang,Yougen andShiZhongkang,Shi geweihui chengli qianxishushi *SomhingsontheEveof ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee"), in January Storm, joint issue of No.5 and No.6, ed. by the WGH, Shanghai.

Why don'twe call it Shanghai Commune?"26His idea got a lot of support from other peopleAnd a Red Guard from the East Is Red of Beijing Sports Institute added the word"new" before the proposed name, Shanghai Commune. In this way, the title, “NewShanghai Commune"(xin Shanghai gongshe)was setfor the proposed power organ.When briefed by attendees of the meeting about the chosen name, Zhang Chunqiaosuggested that it be modify to be the “Shanghai People's Commune"(Shanghairenmin gongshe, later known as “Shanghai Commune").''After the meeting, a team26 Mao had been enthusiastic with the idea of communes. When he visited the first people's commune at QiliyingPeople's Commune of Xingxiang city, Henan Province on Aug. 6, 1958, Mao hailed it, saying: “"it's perfect to callit a people's commune."On Aug.13",1958,thePeople's Daily published an editorial titled“ThePeople'sCommune is perfect." Since then, the communization of rural areas surged throughout the country and also, almostevery Chineseknew that ChairmanMaoloved communes.27Yang Yougen and Shi Zhongkang,“Some Things on the Eve of Shanghai Revolutionary Committee”(Shigeweihui chengli qianxi shushi),in January Storm, joint issue of No.5 and No.6,ed. by the WGH,ShanghaiThere arevarious narratives about the origin of the title of theShanghai Commune..According to a confession byrebel leader Wang Minglong after the 1976 coup, in the middle of January,Wang Hongwen convened a meeting todiscuss the power seizure from the old SPC.At this meeting,the issue of a name for the proposed new powerorgan was discussed.The proposed titles included"The Committee of the Supreme Power of Shanghaimunicipality" (Shanghai shi zuigao quanli weiyuanhui),"The Headquarters of the Supreme Power of ShanghaiMunicipality" (Shanghai shi zuigao quanli zhihuibu),"The Supreme General Headquarters for Power Seizure ofthe Shanghai Proletarian Revolutionaries (Shanghai shi wuchan jieji gemingpai duoquan zuigaozong zhihuibu),and so forth.Finally, Huo Da, a Red Guard from East China Normal University mentioned that in his university,the Red Guards were preparing to form a"New East China Normal University Commune"(xinshida gongshe) inkeeping with the principles of the Paris Commune. Inspired by Huo Da, those at the meeting suggested formingthe Shanghai power organ modeled upon the Paris Commune. At this meeting, Wang Hongwen agreed to name theproposed power organ"New Shanghai Commune"(xin Shanghai gongshe). Zhu Yongjia, a rebel intellectual, gavea similar recollection in his confession to the coup regime on October 15, 1979. Zhu Yongjia stated that the title ofShanghai People's Commune was proposed by Huo Da at a meeting of "Frontline Headquarters" convened by

Shanghai's proposal to call the new power organ a commune was by no meansincidental. After Mao praised Nie Yuanzi's wall poster in July 1966, calling it themanifestoof a1960s'ParisCommune—likebambooshoots after aspringrain-manymass organizations named after “commune”emerged.29 What was attractive to boththe masses and the Maoist leadership was not just that the name commune was used,Zhang Chunqiao. At this meting, Zhang Chunqiao approved Huo Da's proposal, naming the proposed Shanghaipower organ the Shanghai People's Commune (Shanghai renmin gongshe). But according to a memoir by Wang Li,a member of the CCRG,it wasMaoZedongwho decided that the title of theproposed Shanghai power organshould be the Shanghai Commune.See Gu Xunzhong, Guanyu1967nian 1 yue Wang Hongwen jinjing ji Shanghaiquanlu jigou mingchenbianhua deshishi kaoding(A Historical Research on the Issues of Wang Hongwen'sVisitofBeijinginJanuary1967and theNominalShift of theShanghai'sPowerOrgan.),http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=16365, cited on August 22, 2009.28Yang Yougen and Shi Zhongkang,“Some Things on the Eve of Shanghai Revolutionary Committee”(Shigeweihui chengli qianxi shushi),in January Storm,joint issue of No.5 and No.6,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai.29To name a few in Beijing: Beijing Commune of the Central Conservatory of Music, East Is Red Commune ofBeijing Geosciences Institute, East Is Red Commune of Beijing University of Technology, Beijing Commune ofBeijingNo.6HighSchool,East Is Red Commune of BeijingInstitute of Light Industry,East Is Red Commune ofBeijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Sparkle Commune of the Guangming Daily, East Is RedCommune of the CentralDepartment of United Fronts,BeijingCommune of the Central University of Finance andEconomics, the Commune of Politics and Law of Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, the RevolutionaryRebel Commune of the Central Overseas Chinese Commission,East Is Red Commune of BeijingMiningInstituteNew China Commune of the Xinhua News Agency, the Commune of New Beijing University, Jinggang MountainCommune of NewBeijing University,etc.In Shanghai,using“commune”as part of the name was also popularamongmass organizations--such asEast Is Red Commune of FudanUniversity,May 7 Commune of TongjiUniversity, New East China Normal University Commune, and so on. The list merely represents my randomsurveyfromvarious resources and google search.I havefound manymore mass organizations duringthe CR thatwerenamed aftertheParisCommune.

348but rather the organizational and operational principles and possibilities this nameindicated and stood for. As early as December 27, 1966, at the capital mass rally titled"'thoroughly criticizing the Liu-Deng bourgeois reactionary line,” Nie Yuanzi, one ofthe authors of “the first Marxist-Leninist wall poster” and leader of the Commune ofNew Beijing University, suggested forming a Beijing Commune based on a greatalliance of various Beijing Red Guards factions, which "was to have democraticallyelected office-holders and was to resemble the Paris Commune of 1871."30 OnJanuary 30, in a discussion with representatives from two factions of the BeijingBroadcast Station, Wang Li, a member of the CCRG, commented on power seizure:"You evaluate the Paris Commune as perfect? Then how many Commune memberswere Marxists? In as much as what they did, it's good. Marx did not agree with manythings of the Paris Commune. But since the Commune was revolutionary, Marxsupported it...In Beijing we should unite. In accordance with Chairman Mao'sinstructions, people from three sides should form the core: the revolutionary masses.the armed forces, and those who persisted in Chairman Mao's side within the BeijingParty Committee. Quite possibly, the future form of the power organ would still beBeijing People's Commune."31 On February 1, when talking with Beijing Red Guardsand pubic security cadres, another CCRG member Qi Benyu indicated,

Recently people are considering forming a joint organization—the

Beijing Commune. The Center also has this intention. It needs to be30 NealeHunter 1969,p.222.31See“Wang Li's Talk with Comrades from the Two Factions of Beijing Broadcast Station"(Wang Li yu Beijingguangbo diantai liangpai tongzhi dejianghua),transcribed by the Mao Zedong's Thought Red Guards BattleRegiment of the Beijing Broadcast Station and the East Is Red Commune of the Beijing Geosciences University,Jan.30,1967,from http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=21666, cited June 28,2009.

Premier Xie (Fuzhi) is trusted to see tothe preparation of the Beijing Commune.Premier Xie is the firstminister who supports leftists,and he supports the Commune ofPolitics and Law, hence having high prestige among leftistorganizations.

Jiang Qing, the deputy director of the CCRG, also suggested formingcommunesonthesameday.Talkingwiththerepresentativesofmassorganizations atthe Central News and Documentary Film Studio, she instructed: “There are too manybureaucratic organs. Why not establish some people's communes?3 TTellingly,sheposited the commune as the antithesis of thebureaucratic establishment.As theWGHand other rebel organizations were busily preparing the new power organ, theShanghai People's Commune,thefourth takeover of theSPC,initiated by theRedRevolutionaries, the largest and legendary rebel student organization in Shanghai.which achieved glorious revolutionary deeds during thefights against the authoritiesin past months, was also in the process of being formed. It was the RedRevolutionaries that initiated the famous Liberation Daily Incident. Even thoughrebelsgainedvictoryin that battle,this actionwas still criticized amongrebels,for itbegan as an “opportunist and adventurist" action and ended with an “escapist'action.34 The Red Revolutionaries was originally an all-city Red Guard student group32 “Xie Fuzhi and Qi Benyu talk with Beijing Red Guards and Pubic Security Cadres" (Xie Fuzhi Qi Benyu duiBeijing shi Hongweibinghe gongan ganbu de jianghua),Feb.1,1967,inSpeeches of the Central Leaders(Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua), Vol.2, ed. by the Red Guards Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory,March,1967.33JiangQingQi Benyu dui zhongyangxinwen jilu zhipianchangqunzhong daibiaodejianghua(Speeches byJiang Qing and Qi Benyu to the representatives of mass orgas at the Central News and Documentary Film Studio),Feb.1,1967,in Speeches of the Central Leaders (Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua), Vol.2,ed.by the Red GuardsLiaisonPost of the General Beijing GlassFactory,March,1967.34Conghonggehuimouxietoutoupaodazhongyangwengekanwuzhengfuzhuyidefandongbenzhi(TheReactionaryNatureofAnarchismSeenFromsomeHeadsofRedRevolutionaries'BombardmentoftheCCRG),in

The remaining major universities were Fudan University, Shanghai NormalInstitute and Shanghai Jiaotong University, among which Fudan took the lead.35 OnJanuary 23, representatives from some major rebel organizations, including the RedRevolutionaries, held a preparatory meeting for establishing the Shanghai People'sCommunetwodayslater.Atthesametime,sometopmembersof thestandingcommittee of theRed Revolutionariesmet at their own place.TheRedRevolutionaries, became infuriated when they learned that they had not been electedinto the draft committee for the Shanghai People's Commune Manifesto, anddiscussion of the group's internal issues was called off. Guan Yuchao, a standingcommittee member from Shanghai Normal Institute shouted: “Let's argue with themnext time." That night, while participating in the preparatory meeting for the ShanghaiPeople's Commune, in keeping with the secret decision that had been made at theirown meeting, the Red Revolutionaries seized the official seals of the Shanghaiuniversities and colleges.

351organizationsandrepresentativesofPLAfromtheShanghaigarrisoncontinued toassemble at Shanghai Party School to discuss the issue of power seizure, during whichthey worked out a manifesto of power seizure and an announcement to be publishedon newspapers the next day. Meanwhile, countless wall posters were put upthroughout the city to celebrate the coming Shanghai People's Commune.36 OnJanuary 24, only two days after the third power seizure by the Shanghai ThirdHeadquarters, and after making careful plans and preparation at a daytime meeting ofresponsible people from all of its branches, the Red Revolutionaries organized morethan ten Red Guard contingents and dispatched them to different agencies of the SPCIn one night, they swept all official seals from 23 major government and party offices.including the SPC, the Shanghai People's Committee (i.e. the city hall), the EastChina Bureau of CCP, and the Party Committees and People's Committees of tenlower districts.3/ They even occupied one building of the Shanghai Exhibition Hall astheir headquarters,requesting that soldiers from the Shanghai Garrison guard it forthem.

After this seizure of power by the Red Revolutionaries, some rebel factionswere infuriated because the Red Revolutionaries had pushed other rebel groups asideand taken action by themselves. Some factions even stated that they were consideringphysically attacking the Red Revolutionaries. The Red Revolutionaries,under a lot of36 See “Long Live the Victory of the Great January Revolution" (Yiyue geming wansui), from Workers' RebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),Jan.12,1968.37Another source saysthat theWGHdbyPanGuoping alsotook part inthe actionof capturing sealsee"Annals of theReactionaryActivities of BombardingtheCCRGbySomeRed Revolutionaries Heads"(Dashiji:honggehuitoutou paoda zhongyang wengefangeming huodongyilanbiao),from the joint issue of“AdvanceExpressNews"(Tingjinkuaibao)and“FrontlineNews”(huoxianbao),ed.bytheRevolutionaryRebelsCommitteeofShanghaiInstituteofMachinery,Feb,24,1967

352pressure because of such public opinion,had to deal wtih this situation.They invitedthe three other largest and most influential rebel organizations for a negotiationmeeting to discuss the possibility of forming a coalition government which would becentered around theRed Revolutionaries.These organizations were theWGHrepresenting rebel workers, the Shanghai Revolutionary Peasant Rebels' GeneralHeadquarters (Preparatory Committee) representing rebel peasants, and theRevolutionary Rebel Liaison Centre of Organizations of the Shanghai MunicipalParty Committee representing literati rebels. Influenced by Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan's insistence on building the broadest unity rather than a small alliance withonly four organizations, Xu Jingxian and Wang Chenlong, the leaders of literati rebels,tried their best to persuade the Red Revolutionaries not to capture power merely forthefour groups. There were at least 32 rebel organizations which usually helcmeetings and took coalition actions together-sohow could these friendly rebelfactions be pushes aside? If the Red Revolutionaries insisted on their original plan, acivilwar amongrebelswouldbeunavoidable.

During the meeting that night, Yao Wenyuan called the four groups severaltimes.After talkingwithYao,theleaders of theWGHPanGuopingwereleaningtonot support the plan suggested by the Red Revolutionaries.Moreover, all three otherorganizations were inclined to go along with Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan'sproposal to convene a large joint meeting that included different rebel factions tonegotiate and discuss how to cooperatively seize power and how the new power organthat is, the proposed Shanghai People's Commune, would operate. These three

353organizations also said that theRed Revolutionaries should hand over the officialseals they held to the proposed Shanghai Commune, because if they could notguarantee the security of these seals, there might be some bad results - such aspassports being unofficially issued for people to go abroad. This unexpected scenarioand arrangement challenged and offended the Red Revolutionaries. Li Gongzuo, oneof its leaders, shouted: “it's the Red Revolutionaries who captured the seals, whyshould we turn it over to the Shanghai Commune? She even hinted that the ShanghaiCommune was nothing more than a disorganized mixture of different rebels. In theend, however, the rebels agreed to send all of the official seals they had just seizedfrom the old Shanghai government to the garrison, who would give them back to theiroriginal holders who could then continue functioning.*°But the Red Revolutionariesstill insisted on issuing their own“Announcement of Power Seizure"in majornewspapers and they threatened to not to recognize the Shanghai Commune if theywere not allowed to do this. But the announcement was not released the next day. Inorder to leave room for negotiations with the largest rebel student body—the RedRevolutionaries, and due to resistance and defeiance also coming from the GengJinzhang-led Second Corps (more on this below), the actual formation of the proposedShanghai Commune was postponed until January 28. This postponement of theShanghai Commune's inauguration, however, would not be the last delay.

This aborted power seizure really hurt the prestige and pride of the RedRevolutionaries. It also led to deep discontent and dissent directed toward Zhang38 Xu Jingxian 2003, pp.47-51.

354Chunqiao,thepivotalfigurewhohadbeenresponsibleforthe other threerebelorganizations withdrawing their support. The Red Revolutionaries began to probedeep into the family background and private life of Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan, a move likely suggested and supported by some power holders from the oldSPC whoknew Zhang andYao very well. This probe unearthed the fact that Zhang'swife Li Wenjing was a traitor during anti-Japanese wartime and that Yao Wenyuan'sfatherYaoPengzi withdrew from the CCP during theWhite Terror Period.But thisinformationwasobtainedfromtheCCParchives,whichindicatedthattherewasactuallynoserious blot on their character, and that according to theCCP's officialregulations, they had been qualified for promotions after strict examinations of theirfamily backgrounds. Thus, these materials were far from enough to bring down ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. The Red Revolutionaries, therefore, put on the agendathe inquiry of Zhang and Yao's political blunders or possible crimes.

Together with some other Red Guard student organizations, they began totarget Xu Jingxian, theleader of the literati rebels and seemingly a closefriend ofZhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. Xu Jingxian and all of his colleagues whoworked in theWriters'Group of theSPC,a unit under the direct leadership ofShanghai Propaganda Department which Zhang Chunqiao headed before the CR,rebelled collectively on November, 1966. Their rebellion was encouraged by ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyuan.3" This kind of “collective rebellion” was unprecedented39 Similarly, Jiang Qing personally urged the first secretary of the SPC Chen Pixian several times to rebel, but gotno positive response from Chen.See Chen Pxian 2005,pp.72-82.The attempt to bring down Zhang Chunqiao byinvestigating his Writers' Group of the SPC was not a new tactic. In the middle of November, 1966,the first Partysecretary ChenPixian encouraged a conservativeRed Guard group in Fudan Universty--TheFudan UniversityBrigade of the Red Guards'Headquarters of the Shanghai Universities and Colleges (hongweibing shanghai shi

355because in other places, intensive struggles had always emerged between two rivalgroups——-between the rebels and the conservatives. So this appeared to be a rare case,as oneunit had never rebelled collectively.Before their“collective rebellion",XuJingxian and his colleagues, such as Zhu Yongjia, were very active in helping theShanghai authorities to suppress the rebel movement. On the night right before theWriters' Group's “collective rebellion,”"Xu Jingxian was even busy writing aninsincere “self-criticism" for Chen Pixian, the first secretary of the SPC. In the eyes ofthe young Red Guards, the rebellion by Xu Jingxian and his colleagues seemed fakeand it appeared that Xu himself might be one of the secret members of the old SPCwhich had gone underground for the time being to set up an alternative Shanghaigovernment that could function in an urgent situation such as the ongoing CR

In the same vein, if Xu Jingxian could be a secret agent of the collapsing oldShanghai government, why could this not be also true of Zhang Chunqiao?In the eyesof some Red Guards, if Zhang Chunqiao was in fact a secret agent, then this wouldexplain why he had vigorously opposed the seizure of power by the RedRevolutionaries. Thinking that this was in fact the case, some Red Guard groupsdecided to take actions against Zhang Chunqiao.As early as January 23, "MonkeyKing" led by Hu Shoujun, a small branch of Fudan's Red Guard organizationBombardingHeadquarters,put upmany anti-ZhangChunqiaowall posters at theBund, the old colonial park near the Huangpu River in Shanghai.

356these posters read “Be careful of Tao Zhu and Wang Renzhong style figures!40,*"Zhang Chunqiao is not equal to the CCRG!“Firmly oppose the formation of NewSPC Headed by Zhang Chunqiao at the present time!"Another small Fudan studentfaction called “Kai Xin Yu" (Creating New World) started to gather information aboutZhang Chunqiao that could be used against him.41

The Shanghai Liaison Center of the Jinggang Mountains Headquarters ofQinghua University, another faction that opposed Zhang Chunqiao, was from BeijingA regiment of the Jinggang Mountains Headquarters in Beijing led by Kuai Dafuturned against Premier Zhou Enlai and Kang Sheng, a key member of the CCRG anda standing committee member of the CCP politburo. Its influence soon reached itsShanghai liaison post, which decided to follow its Beijing general headquarters andlaunched a campaign against Kang Sheng's counterpart in Shanghai, i.e. ZhangChunqiao, who was a major member of the CCRG as well. A Red Guard paper bluntlypresented a causal link:“By devious routes, this Peking reaction against Premier Zhouand ComradeKangSheng affected the situation in Shanghai,where there was asimilar reaction against Comrade Zhang Chunqiao.*42Campaigns against majormembersoftheCCRGhadsuccessfulprecedents,as theformerNo.5ChineseleaderTao Zhu and the governor of Hubei Province Wang Renzhong were also majormembers of the CCRG and were brought down during 1967.40 Tao Zhu and Wang Rezhong were the ex-members of the CCRG who were later brought down.

OnJanuary 24, theShanghai Liaison Center of theJinggangMountainsHeadquarters of Qinghua University put up a wall poster, denouncing as amanifestation of economism, the parading of aledgedly guilty old Shanghaigovernment officials through the streets in 4-ton trucks for ten days.43 Even thoughZhang could not totally control thesekinds of mass-initiated actions conducted bydifferent rebel factions, the poster hinted that Zhang Chunqiao was responsible fonthis humiliating treatment of old cadres and this newkind of economism,.Forinstance, even the WGH, which was led by the strong-headed Pan Guoping andusually seen by its political rivals as Zhang Chunqiao's political instrumentsometimes did not listen to Zhang and took actions on its own initiative, not tomention the unruly Geng Jinzhang, the head of the Second Corps. The JinggangMountains Headquarters of Qinghua University had a lot of prestige throughout thecountry. Even though its members in Shanghai were few, their attitudes toward ZhangChunqiao gained a lot of influence among Shanghai Red Guards. What motivatedthese student factions to oppose Zhang Chunqiao was vividly manifested when the“Monkey King” leaders went to the office of the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Centreof Organizations of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee and debated with XuJingxian, the leader of the intellectual rebels. When Xu why they attacked ZhangChunqiao,HuShoujun answered,

Thegoal of our rebellionis tobring down theSPC.ZhangChunqiac

was a secretary of the old SPC's secretariat.Now the SPC is a black43 Neale Hunter 1969, pp.231-232.

358bourgeoisheadquarters and all othersecretarieshavegraveproblems,why not Zhang Chunqiao? We think that the internal class front of theSPC is still not clear, so we oppose forming a new SPC at present, andespecially oppose selecting Zhang Chunqiao and others to act as theleaders of the new SPC!44

It was understandable for young Red Guards, such as Hu Shoujun, to thinkthat Zhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuan might be hidden capitalist roaders obeyingthe orders of the falling SPC, because Zhang Chunqiao was a senior official of theSPC. But Hu Shoujun and his like-minded Red Guards might have forgotten thatZhang Chunqiao was the first senior Shanghai official to stand out and decisivelysupported the rebel workers after the Anting Incident; and that Yao Wenyuan was themain ideologue of the CR who had written, with the help of Zhang Chungqiao, thefamous treatise,"OntheNewHistoricalPlayDismissal ofHaiRui"inNovember1965-which triggered the outburst of the CR. Moreover, except Zhao Chunqiao andYao Wenyuan, no other senior Shanghai officials had sincerely expressed and lenttheir support to the rebels at the time. If Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan werebrought down as well as their superior officers Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu, wherewould the proposed new power organ find its experienced and revolutionary highranking cadres? Also, the method and practice of the radical Red Guards, such as HuShoujun, of “dismissing and bringing down all cadres", was obviously, contrary to thestatementin theSixteen-pointProgramwhichhad stated that themajorityof cadreswere good, or relatively good, and could be saved. For Hu Shoujun and the like, allShanghai senior cadres were out-and-out capitalist roaders. Neverthless, withunsubstantiated suspicions and ungrounded wild guesses, Hu Shoujun and other44 Xu Jingxian 2003,p.59.

359ultra-leftist Red Guards launched a fierce attack on Zhang and Yao, accusing them ofbeing“capitalist roaders"

The attack against Zhang Chunqiao was at least in part rooted in a significanttrend of thought throughout the CR, the political line of "doubting everything" and“striking everything down". Although“doubting everything"(De omnibusdubitandum est) camefrom Descartes,it was widely quoted as one of Marx's mottoand understandably, few people could challenge it due to Marx's prestigious status inCommunist theory.* By invoking Marx's old soul, almost everybody quoted it as thereason for one's actions. It was used to partially and theoretically justify the actualpractice of “striking everything down" in the CR. Just after the People's Dailypublished Nie Yuanzi and her colleagues? first wall poster in Beijing University onJune 2, 1966, some people spoke out about “doubting everything” and argued that"doubting everything is good.*46This attitudesoonbecamefashionable among themasses.Infact,Red Guards andrebelworkerswerenot the onlyoneswhousedMarx's motto as their principle - some “big-shots" among top cadres in the Center ofCCP also appropriated it for their own purposes. Tao Zhu, for example, the third partyboss in the so-called Liu-Dengist headquarters, a major member of the CCRG and astanding committee member of the CCP politburo, enjoyed this slogan so much thathe introduced it to many Red Guards on various public occasions. Tao Zhu received aletter from Gu Ruihua, a student from the China Medical University in Beijing, in45 When responding to the questions of his daughters Jeny and Laura in 1865, Marx stated that his favorite mottowas Descartes'"De omnibus dubitandum [doubt everything]." See Karl Marx, Confessions, in MECW.Volume 42,p.568.6Gu Ruihua tongzhi gei Tao Zhu de xin (*"The Letter from Comrade Gu Ruihua to Tao Zhu"), in Wuchan jiejiwenhuadagemingcankaoziliao(ReferenceMaterialsfortheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution),Vol.1,compiled by theRed Propagandist FightingTeam in Beijing Institute of Chemical Technology,et al.,1966.

360which Guexpressed his deep concern about the spread of this“doubt everythingthought and emphasized that ChairmanMaohad never beenfor this slogan.Tao Zhupublicly criticized this at arallyspeech at Gu's university

Now it's the time for you to disclose everything and everybody. Tryyour best to do it. Gu Ruihua's responding letter exerted a badinfluence.In the Great Cultural Revolution, it is correct to doubteveryone.ButyoucannotdoubtChairmanMao...youcannotdoubttheChinese revolution led by the CCP; you cannot doubt that we follow asocialistpathtowardcommunism.Exceptfor thosementioned above,you can doubteverything.Ifcadresleadwell,doubt awhile and thenstop; if cadres lead badly, doubt them to the end and bring themdown.47

On other occasions, Tao Zhu said: "I am all for bombardment in general . . :nobody knows what the headquarters really represents, and that goes for everyheadquarters,”' or even "You can oppose anybody."48 Marshal Ye Jianying, aconservative in the army and one of the main players in the coup d'etat of 1976, alsoasserted that "it should be permitted for people to doubt, boldly doubt and doubteverything.49

As early as January18,1967,a small faction Fanfupi("Against Restoration')in Fudan University reposted the wall poster "there must be a second chaos in Fudan",which claimed to "carry forward the proletarian spirit of doubting everything. "5047 Tao Zhu's Speech at the China Medical University”(Tao Zhu zai zhongguo yike daxue de jianghua),Aug.23,1966,inReferenceMaterialsfortheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution(Wuchanjiejiwenhuadagemingcankao ziliao), Vol. 1, compiled by the Red Propagandist Fighting Team in Beijing Institute of ChemicalTechnology,et al.,1966.48Yao Wenyuan,“Comments on Tao Zhu's Two Books"” (Ping Tao Zhu de liang ben shu),in People's Daily, Sep. 8,1967, its English version can be found at “Comments on Tao Chu's Two Books", Peking Review, No. 38, Sep. 15,1967.49 “SpeechByYe Jianying at TheMass Rally of Revolutionary Teachers and StudentsFrom Beijing PLA MilitaryAcademies"(YeJianyingzaizhongyang junweizhaokai dezaijingjunshiyuanxiaogeming shishengdahuishangde jianghua),Nov.13,1966,inVariousReactionaryThoughts During the GreatProletarian Cultural Revolution,ed.bytheWritingGroupof theSPC,1970.50See thepamphlet Yihonggehui mouxiefuzerenwei daibiao depaodazhongyangwenge defandongniliu jiyao

361When discussing the bombardment of Zhang Chunqiao that started at the end of theJanuary Storm in Shanghai, An Wenjiang, the former leader of Third Headquarters ofShanghai' Red Guards Red Guard who actively participated in it, candidly admittedthat at that time a good segment of Red Guards was indeed driven by the line of"doubting everything"?′ He recalled:

After the collapse of the capitalist roaders, the still fanatical RedGuardslooked for new objects onwhich to vent.Thefirstway theyfound was the civil war that intensified day by day. The second waywas to turn the spearhead of the struggle against suspicious figures inthe new regime. “To doubt everything” became the most fashionableslogan.At the time,we don't have enough materials to verify thedoubts about Zhang Chunqiao, but once we began to doubt him, thenbombardment naturally ensued. Isn't Zhang a secretary of the old SPC?How come Zhang is so good yet the old SPC followed a revisionistline? Didn't Zhang's wife have a history of problems ?52

Tao Zhu was later brought down by the Maoist camp in January 1967 becauseof his support for the Liu-Dengist line. Yao Wenyuan, a writer and ideologue, wrote abook titled Comments on TaoChu(Zhu)'sTwoBooks inSeptember 1967 to condemnTao. In this book, Yao argued that Tao Zhu was "Left" in form but Right in essence.and that he "creatively" developed the bourgeois reactionary line of "hitting hard atmany in order to protect a handful." Tao's purpose, Yao sharply pointed out

was toblur the distribution between the proletarian headquarters and

the bourgeois headquarters, and direct the spearhead of attack at the(ASummaryof theReactionaryCountercurrentofBombardingtheCCRGRepresentedbySomeRedRevolutionaries'Responsible Persons), Ed.by The Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Centre of Organizations of theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,March1967.51According to An's recollection, the Anti-Zhang Camp also put up wall posters titled “Long Live theRevolutionary Spirit of Doubting Everything”in Shanghai in January 1967, from An Wenjiang,“I Would NotConfess”(Wobu chanhui),in 1966: Recollections of Our Generation (1966,women na yidai de huiyi), p.106,ed.byXuYouyu,1988.Ibid. pp.104-105.

362proletarianheadquarters headed by ChairmanMaoso that the handfulof Partypersons in authorities taking the capitalist road could sneakaway in the confusion.“To doubt everyone” and such like are designedto deal with the proletarian headquarters. “To doubt everyone”excepthimself,“to overthrow everyone"except himself-isn't theresomething fishy here? Comrades, please note that there are now ahandful of counter-revolutionaries who are adopting the same method.Using slogans that sound extremely"Left"but in essence areextremely Right, they have stirred up evil gusts of "doubtingeveryone,”while bombarding the proletarianheadquarters, creatingdissension and exploiting confusion. To achieve their sinister ulterioraim,theyhavevainly attempted toshake and split theproletarianheadquarters headed by Chairman Mao.S3

WhiletheSixteen-pointProgramnoted thatthemajorityofcadresweregoodor relatively good, some high-ranking officials in the Central government and thearmy, such as Tao Zhu and Ye Jianying, openly encouraged and advocated the line of“doubting everybody” and “striking everything down." Quite possibly, suchencouragement from these top leaders resulted in a lot of uncertainty, complexity andconflicts in theCR.

Let us now return toShanghai at the end of January Revolution of 1967.At thetime the Shanghai Red Guards were split into at least two camps. Before January 23“Monkey King" of "Bombarding Headquarters", “Kai Xin Yu" (Creating New World),and Shanghai Liaison Center of the Jinggang Mountains Headquarters of QinghuaUniversity were small rebel factions that fell into the camp that opposed ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. And many other bigger Red Guard factions, such as Allthe Way Rebels at Jiaotong University and East Is Red Regiment at Tongji Universitysupported Zhang and Yao. But what about the largest Red Guard faction, the Red53 Yao Wenyuan,“Comments on Tao Zhu's Two Books" (Ping Tao Zhu de liang ben shu), in People's Daily, Sep. 8,1967,its English version can be found at“Comments on Tao Chu's Two Books",Peking Review,No. 38, Sep. 15.1967.

363Revolutionaries whohad about 40,oo0members?Whatwas thepredominantline here?TheRed Revolutionaries never issued aformal declaration infavor of ZhangChunqiao as some other factions did -even though the Red Revolutionaries andZhang Chunqiao benefited enormously from each other in the course of previousstruggles to bring down the old SPC. But for some reasons, around the middle ofJanuary, the Red Revolutionaries started to take an increasingly hostile stance towardZhang Chunqiao's supporters, as described above, and even charged them withTrotskyism. With regard to this label, however, as Neale Hunter sensibly pointed out,"the students are unlikely to have thought of it by themselves, which means that theirattack probably was suggested by someone else." Possibly, the bombardment ofZhang Chunqiao might have been a result of interconnections between some studentfactions and disgraced Party bosses like Chen Pixian, though such an hypothesisrequires more evidence.54

As Lenin had pointed out, anarchism was frequently a sort of punishment forthe opportunist sins of the working-class movement.?5 So it was for the studentmovement in Shanghai. Beginning January 24, some leaders of the RedRevolutionaries, such as Lao Yuanyi and Zhao Jihui, got actively involved in thebombardment of Zhang. This was at least in part stimulated by the attacks on ZhangChunqiao by the “Monkey King" group led by Hu Shoujun, which aimed to scorenew "revolutionary" points and show that the Red Revolutionaries were not lagging in54 Neale Hunter 1969, p.233. On January 26, 1967, Chen Pixian told the Red Revolutionaries that ZhangChunqiaowas adouble-dealer.See the pamphletYihonggehuimouxiefuzerenwei daibiaodepaodazhongyangwengedefandongniliujiyao(ASummaryoftheReactionaryCountercurrentofBombardingtheCCRGRepresentedby SomeRed Revolutionaries'ResponsiblePersons),Ed.by TheRevolutionaryRebelLiaison Centreof Organizations of theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,March1967.55V. 1.

364the struggle and were not new conservatives and loyalists. 56 The bombardment ofZhang delayed, once again, the formation of the proposed Shanghai People'sCommune. In order to secure this attack, the Red Revolutionaries formed a specialteam called "Carrying Out The Revolution To TheEnd"tosecretly collect materialsto use against Zhang Chunqiao and the Writing Group of old SPC. The next day, theRed Revolutionaries drafted a wall poster titled “A Second Big Chaos was Necessaryin Shanghai,” openly directing its target of struggle at Zhang Chunqiao.'On January26, in addition to the Red Revolutionaries and Bombarding the Headquarters, the RedThird Headquarters, led by An Wenjiang, officially joined in the bombardment ofZhang as well. At a Red Revolutionary meeting that morning, a Red Guard leader, YuDingjin attacked Zhang Chunqiao, saying that after Zhang had arrived in Shanghaithe city's movement did not advance very much and that Zhang just staged publicitystunts and campaigns.Another leader conveyed the words from"Monkey King"thatto bombard Zhang Chunqiao was to seize power. After this, a great deal of anti-Zhangwall posters similar to “A Second Big Chaos was Necessary in Shanghai” flooded thecity.

365Red Revolutionaries was aborted, the Red Revolutionaries of Fudan dispatched morethan 30 Red Guards to “make a reconnaissance of Zhang Chunqiao by firing,” andstorm the Shanghai Party School where“Jilianzhan",led byXu Jingxian, wasstationed. In this storm, the Red Revolutionaries kidnapped Xu Jingxian, a determinedsupporter of Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, and a staff person who argued withthem. When another intellectual rebel leader, Wang Chenglong, wanted to argue onthe spot with the dispatched Red Guards,the Red Guards attacked Wang and threwhim to the floor, causing him to go into a coma. They also wanted to kidnap anotherleader, Guo Renjie, but were intercepted by other staff persons of the Liaison Centreand especially the vice leader of the powerful Second Corps of the WGH, whchappened to also be there. They even went to the home of Zhu Yongjia, the thirdleader of Liaison Centre and a responsible representative of “Frontline Headquartersof Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production in Shanghai'who had been sent bythe Liaison Centre, and dragged Zhu from his sick bed and carried him away. Then,whenGuoRenjiewenttoFudan tonegotiatewiththeRedRevolutionaries about thekidnapping, he was also grabbed and detained The Red Revolutionaries hoped toobtain useful information that they could use against Zhang Chunqiao byinterrogating of Xu Jingxian and other kidnapped intellectual rebel leaders.8

After these abductions, invoking orders issued by the Center in Beijing thatarmy forces should aid the rebel leftists, people from the Liaison Centre immediatelycalled the Shanghai garrison three times to request protection. When the garrisor58 See “The Truth of Kidnapping Incident on January 28" (1.28 bangjia shijian zhenxiang), reported by theRevolutionaryRebel LiaisonCentreof Organizations of theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,fromhttp://www.wengewang.0rg/read.php?tid=3891&keyword=%B0%F3%BC%DC,,citedonJuly3,2009

366called the Fudan's Red Revolutionaries and tried to confirm the kidnappings, therebels resolutely denied what had happened and then quickly transferred Xu Jingxianto another hiding place. The Shanghai garrison first asked for instructions andpermissionfrom Nanjing MilitaryDistrict, who was in charge of the Shanghai army.and then upon Zhang Chunqiao's agreement, they sent a detachment of police andsoldiers to look for the kidnapped Liaison Centre rebel leaders. The troops finallyfound the place where the rebels were hiding Xu Jingxian that night. But they onlybriefly questioned the Red Guards, and then withdrew quite early in the morning. TheRed Guards felt strong that the army should not be used to suppress the studentmovements and the Red Revolutionaries took two PLA officers of the dispatchedtroops and held them hostage.""While they were being held, Xu Jingxian and GuoRenjie wrote a “Seven Questions” poster. The first question addressed the issue ofwhat underlay the anti-Zhang Chunqiao trend, and asked why some people were sofanatically bombarding Zhang when it was Chen Pixian who was falling, but not yetcompletely down.Another question asked how some people could claim that Zhang'sappearance in Shanghai started the wind of economism when this had actually beeninitiated by the SPC meeting on January 1 in accordance with Chen Pixian'sinstructions, and it wasn't until January 4 when Zhang Chunqiao arrived in Shanghaias an inspector of the CCRG?60

By morning, all of Shanghai's anti-Zhang Chunqiao Red Guard factions began59 But acording to narratives of Red Revolutionaries, these two offices stayed of their own fre will see Hunter,1969,p.240.60 Xu Jingxian and Guo Renjie,μSeven Questions" (Qi wen), in Red Guards Batle News (Hongwei zhanbao),ed.by Shanghai Headquarters of Red Guards,Feb.6,1967.

367to demonstrate their solidarity in the battle to bombard Zhang, even thoughinternecine wars among them continued. An Wenjiang of the “Red ThirdHeadquarters"claimed,"I resolutely took the stance of the Red Revolutionaries. Nowit's time to unite.” And the “Red Third Headquarters” sent some Red Guards to theneighboring Zhejiang Province to investigate Zhang's past. Meanwhile, the “Kai XinYu" faction of Fudan Red Guards was busy putting up anti-Zhang Chunqiao wallposters.?l Zhao Jihui, a leader of the Red Revolutionaries, expressed his solidaritywith the East Is Red—Bombarding the Headquarters faction: “Don't mention NewShanghai Commune. It could not be staged. After the anti-Zhang wall posters of EastIs Red—Bombarding the Headquarters [were on display], Fudan shows a good newatmosphere. Now we can form our own New Fudan Commune." The anti-Zhang rebelfaction, as well as the conservative Red Guard factions, such as the “BeijingCommune”of Fudan, were also excited to hear this big news of the bombardment ofZhang Chunqiao.They actively gathered negative materials on Zhang, too.

The night of January 28, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan were summonedby several hundred Red Revolutionaries,to theSino-Soviet FriendshipBuilding,andsubjected toinquiries about the so-called"TheIncident of DispatchingPLA Troops toFudan". At the meeting presided over by Zhao Jihui of the Red Revolutionaries,Zhang and Yao had to undergo a 6-hour grilling that went on until two o'clock, thenext morning.And both of them had to stand the whole time because the Red Guards61See the pamphlet Yi honggeuimouxie fuzerenwei daibiao de paodazhongyang wenge de fandong niliu jiyao(ASummaryoftheReactionaryCountercurrentofBombardingtheCCRGRepresentedbySomeRedRevolutionaries'ResponsiblePersons),Ed.byTheRevolutionaryRebel LiaisonCentreof Organizationsof theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,March1967.

368took their seats away.Some students shouted:“Zhang Chunqiao cannot represent theCCRG."“Since Kang Sheng was caught in Beijing, we need to catch Zhang Chunqiaccorrespondingly." "Uncover the black underground SPC.62 They ordered Zhang andYao to recite a Mao quotation, “picking up a rock to drop it on one's own feet” tomake fun of them and even tried to turnYaoWenyuan against Zhang Chunqiao byurging Yao "not to be a slave." They also demanded that Zhang and Yao sign astatement, declaring that the pro-Zhang rebel student organizations were fraught with"Trotskyist and anarchist tendencies.*63 To humiliate Zhang, Lao Yuanyi, the leaderof the“Red Third Headquarters" added two lines to a leaflet that had the slogan,"Zhang Chunqiao is an unswerving revolutionary left." One line quoted from afamous poem of the Song Dynasty,“Flowers fall down reluctantly while swallowscome back like an acquaintance", and another was“This slogan is now blanked out'The rebels then handed this “amended" leaflet to Zhang64

The next night, the Fudan Red Revolutionaries held a rally to pledge massefforts to bombard Zhang Chunqiao. At midnight, the standing committee of the RedRevolutionaries decided to organize 100,000 people to attend a rally to bombardZhang Chunqiao at the Culture Plaza the next day. The main slogan set for this rallywas,“Ten Thousand Cannons Bombard Zhang Chunqiao." Lao Yuanyi even notifiedpeople to control the Shanghai airport in case Zhang Chunqiao attempted to escape by62 “Look,to What Extent have theHeads of Red Revolutionaries Degenerated!(Kan, gonggehui toutou duoluodaohedeng dibu!),in Red Guards Battle News (Hongwei zhanbao),ed.by Shanghai Headquarters of Red Guards.Feb.6,1967.63 Neale Hunter, 1969, pp.237-238.64 See “Annals of the Reactionary Activities of Bombarding the CCRG by Some Red Revolutionaries Heads”"(Dashiji: honggehui toutou paoda zhongyang wenge fangeming huodong yilanbiao), from the joint issue of“"Advance Express News”(Tingjin kuaibao)and“Frontline News"(huoxian bao),ed.by the Revolutionary RebelsCommittee of ShanghaiInstitute of Machinery,Feb,24,1967.

369air.MaLixin,another majorleader of theRedRevolutionariestrackeddown theaddresses of Zhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuan so that they could parade Zhang andYao in the streets the next day. This was seen as a way of humiliating Zhang and Yaoby parading them through the streets.The bombardment of Zhang Chunqiao wasintended to bombard the proposed Shanghai Commune that had been planned byvarious rebel organizations such as theWGH, the RevolutionaryRebel Liaison Centreof Organizations of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, and otherpro-Commune Red Guard factions. So it was anticipated that once the anti-Zhangrally took place next day, the WGH et al. would not hesitate to dispatch rebel workersto break up the rally. If the rally had been held on time, a bloody conflict mainlybetween anti-Zhang Red Guards and the pro-Zhang rebel workers would haveprobablybeenunavoidable

But an urgent telegram dated January 29 from Beijing dealt a heavy blow tothe Red Revolutionaries and shattered the dreams of the anti-Zhang Chunqiao RedGuards.The telegram read:

1.SomeRed Revolutionaryleadershaverecently turned thespearhead of the struggle against Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, andthe Central Cultural Revolution Groupinstead of against ChenPixianand Cao Diqiu, the Shanghai representatives of the bourgeoisreactionary line and the main Party authorities taking the road back tocapitalism.Thisisquitewrong.

2. They have arbitrarily arrested some revolutionary comradesin the Shanghai Municipal Committee's administration. They mustrelease these men at once, and apologize to them.

3. The action of the People's Liberation Army in defense of amass revolutionary organization was entirely correct; that of the Red

370Revolutionaryleaders,whoforciblydetainedapolitical commissar anda staff officer, was completely mistaken and will certainly not betolerated.

4.Arguments between mass organizations must be settled bydiscussion and negotiation, not by such illegal methods as arrest anddetention.

5.Wetrust thecomradesof theShanghaiRedRevolutionarieswill help their leaders correct these mistakes straight away.If theleaders persist in their errors, the ordinary members should break withthem.Wewill dowhatever elsehas tobe done.

The leaders who provoked this incident, and those who aremanipulating them from behind the scenes, will be held responsible forany consequences that arise.65

Once the telegram reached Shanghai on January 3O, the WGH and the RedGuards who were pro-Zhang Chunqiao and in favor of the proposed ShanghaiCommune, such as East Is Red Regiment of Tongji University, sent out manypropagandavans and put up a lot of wall posters to publicize the telegram.The RedRevolutionaries nowbecame the target of fierce attacks from all kinds of politicalorganizations. Then, in the early morning of January 30, the WGH closed off theCulture Plaza where the anti-Zhang rally was supposed to be held. Under a lot ofpolitical pressure from Beijing and fearing possible bloody fight with the WGH, theplannedrallyof1oo,oo0peopletobombardZhangChunqiaoattheCulturePlazawascancelled.Claiming the telegram was a forgery, three major leaders of the anti-Zhangcamp, Lao Yuanyi, Zhao Jihui, and An Wenjiang went to Beijing to find out if thetelegram was genuine and to seek support for their line. To their great disappointment,65 From a leaflet titled “Urgent telegram from the CCRG to the Red Guards Revolutionary Commitee of ShanghaiColleges concerning their movetobombard ZhangChunqiao"(ZhongyangwengegeiShanghai honggehuiguanyutamenpaodaZhangChunqiaodetejidianbao),fromSpeechesoftheCentralLeaders(Zhongyangshouzhang jianghua),Vol.1,ed.by the Red Guards LiaisonPost of the General Beijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March, 1967; the English translation is from Neale Hunter 1969,pp.240-241.

371however,theyfoundoutthatthetelegramwasauthentic.Nevertheless,eventhoughthe large scale anti-Zhang rally was called off, one branch of the Red Revolutionariesin the Shanghai Normal Institute still held a rally on Feb. 2 to pledge resolutions andmass efforts aimed at bombarding Zhang Chunqiao. At this rally, Chi Dongming, aleader of the Red Revolutionaries, swore to carry out the anti-Zhang activity to theend even if he ended up in jail.° After gathering, they marched through the streets,winding their way to the Institute of Chemical Technology and eventually to ShanghaiJiaotong University. Here they encountered firm resistance from pro-Zhang studentfactions, such as the All the Way Rebels and the Zunyi Regiment.67 These kinds ofconflicts between the two camps burst out here and there for several days in the city.Given the overwhelming propaganda campaign by the pro-Zhang forces, the unity ofthe anti-Zhang camp began to collapse. Many common student rebels of anti-Zhangorganizations demanded that their leaders explain the recent events.Eventually, theanti-Zhangleadershad to organizerallieswheretheymadepublic apologies andrequestedamnestyfromChairmanMao

At a meeting on February 1 when Zhang and Yao talked with rebel students,andrefutedtheRedRevolutionaries'accusationthatZhangChunqiaousedthePLAtosuppress the student movement. Yao Wenyuan stated that it was actually the RedRevolutionaries themselves whofirst used armyforces to deal with other rebel66Yixiaocuo honggehui toutou paoda Zhang Chunqiao tongzhi zuixiang zhaiyao(A Summary of the Crimes ofBombarding Comrade Zhang Chunqiao by a Handful of Honggehui Heads), in Dongfanghong (East Is Red), Feb.14, 1967, ed. by Mao Zedong sixiang hongweibing Shanghai shi dongfanghong zongbu and Tongji daxuedongfanghongbingtuan.57SeethepamphletYi honggehui mouxiefuzerenwei daibiaodepaodazhongyangwengedefandong niliujiyao(A Summary of theReactionary Countercurrent ofBombardingtheCCRGRepresented bySomeRedRevolutionaries'ResponsiblePersons),Ed.byTheRevolutionaryRebel LiaisonCentreof Organizationsof theShanghaiMunicipalPartyCommittee,March1967.

372factions.For example,Yaopointedout

Red Revolutionaries twice requested troops from the Shanghai garrisonwith a threatening tone. On January 24 when Red Revolutionariesseized powerfrom theEastChinaBureau of the CCP and theSPC,theShanghai garrison had to send troops [upon Red Guards' request]. OnJanuary 26when they wanted to hold a meeting of their standingcommittee, they requested troops again to protect the meeting. OnJanuary 30, when they planned to hold a rally for bombarding ZhangChunqiao, they said: "We are going tohold a big rally, so you shouldsend troops to protect us. In addition, the vice-commander, the divisioncommissar and the troops which took part in the previous action shouldbe on the spot tobe subjected to our disclosure and accusation.Howcould a revolutionary organization use troops to deal with otherorganizations?What would happen if this kind of thing develops? ...One organization feared debate, hence used armed forces to press otherorganizations.How come the Red Revolutionaries developed to suchan extent?..Some of their leadersvery muchfeared that otherswouldrebel against them...Red Revolutionaries didn't want to present thefacts and reason things out.68

On the eve of the establishment of the Shanghai Commune, some intellectualrebelleadersofthejilianzhan,oneofthemajorinitiatorsoftheShanghaiCommunewere jailed by another participating organization, the Red Revolutionaries. Thejilianzhan had to resort to the“aiding revolutionary leftist" troops to be rescued. Thiswas, clearly, a typical case of internecine struggles which shifted the generalorientation of struggles awayfrom the old power holdersled by ChenPixian and CaoDiqiu. The underlying reasons that this happened, Yao Wenyuan pointed out, was thattherewere capitalist roaders whowere unwilling to admit their downfall and triedtheir best tofind new ways to use the rebels to further their cause.According toYao68 See“Zhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuan talked about the Red Revolutionaries in Shanghai Universities”(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuantanShanghai Gaoxiaohonggehui),fromSpeechesof theCentralLeaders(Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua),Vol.2,ed. by the Red Guards Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March,1967.

373onepracticalreasonfortheRedRevolutionariestohateZhangandYao,wasthatYaohad phoned the Red Revolutionaries and asked them to join the broadest unity ratherthan take the action of capturing official seals by themselveds.And the bombardmentof Zhang further made it impossible to build the broadest unity in order to carry outlarger seizures of power.

Similarly, Zhang Chunqiao also suspected that the old Shanghai Party cadreshad been behind the move against him and against the proposed new power organ -for this catered to thewishes of ChenPixian and CaoDiqiu.Zhangmentioned that hereceived a letter from Cao Diqiu requesting a personal meeting with him when thestudents’ anti-Zhang campaign was still going on. Zhang realized this request by CaoDiqiu was not a mere coincidence. Zhang recalled that Cao Diqiu once told him,“When you were at the Central Committee in Beijing, you issued instructions left andright. Now you are here in Shanghai, and it's your turn to taste it.*69 To ZhangChunqiao's surprise, the Red Revolutionaries who struggled against him claimedalmost the same thing: "In the past, you just issued orders from Beijing, now you canhave a taste of us in Shanghai."700°Zhang brought people's attention to the facts that inthe streets of Shanghai, therewere only anti-Zhang and no anti-Chen and Caowallposters. He admonished the students telling them that only by struggling against theold capitalist roaders, could the rebels form a great alliance, and that only by goingdeep into the ranks of the workers could the students develop into genuine69Ibid.70See Paoshi Geng Jinzhang kan beishang fanhu er bingtuan zongbu (Look at the General Headquarters of theSecond Corps of ShanghaiWorkersReturnedFrom theNorthThrough GengJinzhang"),inWorkers'Rebel News(Gongren zaofan bao),No.8,ed.by theWGH,Shanghai,Feb.12,1967.

374Marxist-Leninists. To end his talk, Zhang criticized the line of“doubting everything"

The editorial of the third issue of the Red Flag is veryimportant.Weneed to pay attention to the policies and strategies.With regard tocadres,weneedtoholdan"one-divides-into-two"attitude.Don'tstruggle against too many people.At some places all the cadres wereordered to kneel down during meeting sessions.Now the situation ischanged. We must put emphasis on differentiating cadres. In the RedFlag editorial, the same method was proposed. In the beginning it'shard to differentiate, yet when the revolutionary masses grew into themajority, it will be quite wrong not to differentiate. “Doubtingeverything" is an erroneous slogan, a slogan of anarchism andanti-Mao Zedong's Thought.Chairman Mao said: “The officialForeignLanuagePress english translation of this quote is:"We musthavefaithinthemassesandwemusthavefaithintheParty.Thesearetwo cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles we shallaccomplish nothing.""Doubting everything"is ananti-Marxist-Leninist's slogan. In the past no one criticized this sloganbecause the power holders, such as Wang Renzhong and ZhangPinghua,used it to suppress the masses.71

On February 4, there was a big rally of *"Red Revolutionary Fighters MakingHeadway Against the Reactionary Current of Opposing the CCRG", jointly convenedby38units of theRedRevolutionaries.With this,thehistorical role of RedRevolutionaries, Red Third Headquarters, and Bombarding the Headquarters came toan end, even though their organizations still lasted, in form, for a while. They were allpermanently excluded from theproposedShanghai Commune and in the eyes of thepro-Zhang and Shanghai Commune organizations,for good reasons.

Nevertheless, troubles and tensions with regard to the establishment of theShanghai Commune did not come only from the Red Guards represented by the Red71 See “Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan talked about the Red Revolutionaries in Shanghai Universitie(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuan tanShanghaiGaoxiaohonggehui),fromSpeeches of theCentral Leaders(Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua),Vol.2,ed. by the Red Guards Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March,1967.

375Revolutionaries who had several tens of thousands of members.Much more powerfulchallenges actually camefrom dissidentrebelworker factions withintheWGH.Therewere at least five internal dissident factions in WGH: The First Corps of ShanghaiWorkers Returned From the North Led by Dai Zuxiang'", The Second Corps ofShanghai Workers Returned From the North led By Geng Jinzhang'?, The ThirdCorps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the North, The Revolutionary Rebel SteelCorps of Shanghai Workers led by Chen Hongkang'dand The Revolutionary RebelField CorpsofShanghaiWorkers.Thefirstthreesubsidiaryorganizationshadcomeabout as a result of theAnting Incidentwhen theWGH rebel workers,whowentnorthward to Beijing to lodge their complaints, were broken into three groups by theold SPC. The group that was detained at Nanjing formed the First Corps. The groupthat formed the Second Corps was based on the “Suzhou Brigade", and consisted ofnearly5o0workerswhorefused toreturnShanghai.TheseworkersrushedtoSuzhou7 The head of theFirst CorpsDai Zuxiang, a selfproclamed revoltionary ambitionist",was adismidstandingcommitteemember of thepreparatory committee of theWGH.Dai Zuxianglater accused oneof theleaders of the WGH Pan Guoping as a"revisionist", another leader Wang Hongwen as"right-leaning", and theWGH as an"empty shell"without solidpower.SeeBazhengzhi pashouDai Zuxiangjiu chulai shizhong(UncoverthePoliticalPickpocketDaiZuxiangandShowHiminPublic),inCollectedLeaflets(chuandanhuibian,ed.bythe Propaganda Team of the WGH),No.3,Feb.28,1967.73Geng Jinzhang's Second Corps was claimed to have 400,000 to 500, 000 members in Feb.1967. See Jingjihuyu:gao"erbingtuan"quanti duiyuan shu(Emergent Appeal:ToAll theTeam Membersof theSecond Corps),issued on Feb. 23, 1967, in Collected Leaflets (chuandan huibian,ed.by the Propaganda Team of the WGH), No.3,Feb.28,1967.74 The Revolutionary Rebel Steel Corps of Shanghai Workers led by Chen Hongkang later split offrom the WGHand formed the independent Workers'Third Headquarters on two pretexts.They held that: 1. the personnelregimentation was too big as the members of Steel Corps had greatly expanded; 2. there was not enough outlays.WhenSteel Corpswas renamed as theWorkers Third Headquarters,many of the rank and file team members ofSteel Corps did notevenknow that theirfactionwas tobesplitfrom theWGH as anindependent organization.Inorder to expand the team,theWorkers ThirdHeadquarters evenincludedwholesale many conservativefactions insome units such as the Repair Shopfor Pen Components,the Real Estate Bureau of Hongkou District,the GasCompany,etc.Even theheads of thoseex-Scarlet Guardsfactionswere notreplacedwhen thosefactions mergedinto theWorkersThirdHeadquarters.Insome cases,theex-Scarlet Guardsfactions clashed with theWGHfactionsin the same units.Furthermore,disregarding the Centralinjunction not to recruit members trans-regionally,theWorkersThirdHeadquartersrecruited a lotofmembersin thesuburbs or evenin areas outside ofShanghaisuch asSuzhou, Wusong, Baoshan, Chongming, Mingxing, Jingshan County, Luodian, Kunshan, and Anting. As a result,within a short period of twomonths,on the eve of theestablishment of theShanghai Commune,theWorkersThirdHeadquartersclaimedtohave4,0oo,OoOmembers.SeeThe“RebelToTheEnd"FightingTeamof TheRebelsLiaisonPostInside theWorkersThirdHeadquarters,Gongsansi zongbu dafangxiangjiushicuole(TheBigDirectionoftheWorkersThirdHeadquartersiswrong),inCollectedLeaflets(chuandanhuibian,ed.bythePropaganda Team of the WGH),No.3,Feb.28,1967.

376at the time of the Anting Incident in November 1966, after Zhang Chunqiao arrived atAnting and started negotiating with the WGH. The third group consisted of the WGHworkers who set off from Shanghai for Anting on foot. These three different Corpsmade up three separate divisions within the WGH. And as Zhang Chunqiao clearlydiscerned on January 29, these groups had come about because the railway powerholders had divided up and dispersed the rebel workers in the Anting Incident.75When discussing the armed battles in Shanghai among rebel factions after April, 1967,Elizabeth Perry and Li Xun commented: *Despite a thin veneer of ideological debate(with rival leaders accusing one another of ‘rightist opportunism'), these struggles hadmore to do with power and personalities than with political principles.""/6Whatisbeing described here was still true, more or less,in terms of the internecine strugglesaround the establishment of the Shanghai Commune. What should be noted is that thestrategies of the old SPC toward the rebel factions, one of which was the manipulationof fund appropriation to rebel workers, might have also contributed to the split of theWGH and the worker movement. One case in point was the Steel Corps:

WGH Steel Regiment [Corps] leader Chen Hongkang had for sometime harbored desires of setting up an independent kingdom andplanned to hold an inaugural meeting for the Workers' ThirdHeadquarters. Notices had already been printed up, but later he fearedcriticism from various mass organizations, so he temporarily called ahalt to the plan. Chen Pixian saw an opportunity which he hoped toseize by saying, "It's all right for you to want money, but you have tohave an independent organization and name with which to sign for it."

Thereupon the Steel Regiment split off from the WGH and established75 See “Look at the General Headquarters of the Second Corps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the NorthThrough Geng Jinzhang"(Paoshi Geng Jinzhang kan beishang fanhu er bingtuan zongbu), in Workers'Rebel News(Gongren zaofan bao), No. 8, ed. by the WGH, Shanghai, Feb. 12, 1967.6Perry and Li, 1997, p.119.

377the Workers' Third Headquarters.77

The Shanghai power holders applied a similiar strategy toward GengJinzhang's Second Corps. At one point, Geng demanded several thousand WGHarmbands from the general headquarters. But his request was refused because thegeneral headquarters was very tight with money at that time due to intentionaloppression from the old SPC. Geng then threatened that if he did not get the armbandshe wanted, he would rebel against the general headquarters. Later, for some reason,Geng managed to get a great deal of money from the SPC and thus made many WGHarmbands.He then openlyclaimed that if workerswanted tojointheWGH,it wasbetter to go to his Second Corps, since the general headquarters might not be able togive newcomers armbands. The SPC was later charged with an intentional crime inthat it had tried to split theShanghai rebel movement by playing this game ofdivide-and-conquer.8With this method, Shanghai power holders, such as the firstsecretary of SPC Chen Pixian, not only effectively contributed to the spate ofeconomism and exerted pressure on the Center, but also helped to split and divert theShanghai workers’movement -killing two birds with one stone.

Themostpotent internal challenge to theWGHfrom a worker faction camefrom Geng Jinzhang's Second Corps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the North.The Second Corps, similar to the other four Corps, was supposed to be a branch of theWGH led by Pan Guoping and Wang Hongwen. But when the Second Corps returnedto Shanghai from Suzhou after Zhang Chunqiao signed another 5-point demand from77 Perry and Li, 1997, pp123-24.78See Paoshi GengJinzhangkan beishangfanhu er bingtuan zongbu(*Look at the GeneralHeadquarters of theSecond Corps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the North Through Geng Jinzhang"),in Workers'Rebel News(Gongren zaofan bao),No.8,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai,Feb.12,1967.

378Geng's branch, it refused tomerge into thegeneral headquarters of theWGH.Afterthe Anting Battle,Geng Jinzhang told the general headquarters that the Second Corps"resolutely obeyed the WGH's orders" and was “*responsible to the WGH". 79Thereafter, Geng rapidly expanded his branch in the name of the WGH. For sometime major leaders of the general headquarters, such as Pan Guoping and WangHongwen, were chased by conservative workers and had to hide here and thereeveryday.So it was hard for common workers who were ready to join theWGH toseek them out. Being a non-essential target of struggle in the eyes of conservativeworkers, the intrepid Geng Jinzhang frequently went to his branch headquarters andwas ready anytime to accept workers' applications to join the WGH. Very soon,Geng's Second Corps attracted huge numbers of workers. Especially along with thecollapse of the conservative Scarlet Guards, a big bulk of the Scarlet Guards simplyshifted their side and conveniently joined Geng's Second Corps. Ostensibly under thename and aegis of the WGH, within three months, Geng's Second Corps managed tobuild its force from a 474-member Suzhou Brigade into a staggering membership of500,0oo.8° The Second Corps was hence able to set up not only its own sub-branchesthroughout Shanghai's factories, mines, and other enterprises, but also a separateliaison center other than that of the WGH in Beijing. With its rapid and big growththeSecond Corps came to outnumber its parent organizationwhich Geng Jinzhangeventually disregarded completely. Geng even called the WGH just an empty shelland tried to take power from the general headquarters. Sometimes the Second Corps79Ibid.80 Perry and Li, 1997, p.122.

379simplygrabbed thegeneralheadquarters’officestationery,typewriters aswell as otherthings, such as bicycles,without permission. The relationship between the SecondCorps and the general headquarters of the WGH, naturally, became more and moretense. When the Urgent Notice was issued on January 9, the Second Corps, as asubsidiary faction of the WGH, insisted on an independent signature, secondary tothat of the WGH.At 3:30 am on January 15, without informing the WGH and othermajor rebel organizations, the Second Corps joined together with the Shanghai RedGuard Third Headquarters to raid the SPC compounds and they declared they hadcaptured powerfrom theShanghai authorities.

In line with the requirement set by the Maoist leadership in Beijing, ofcombining and incorporating revolutionary cadres, Geng Jinzhang chose ZhangChunqiao and YaoWenyuan as the objects of incorporation. To Geng Jinzhang'sdisappointment, Zhang refused and insisted on the broadest unity in seizing power. Toseek an alternative, Geng Jinzhang ordered that the major power holders of the SPC—Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu and Ma Tianshui (a secretary of the old SPC) —be grabbedfrom the WGH and that these three big shots be held under his “protection". As waslaterrevealedbytheWGH'srebuke,theSecondCorpsthemselvesnotonlydidnotstruggle against these power holders,but was also reluctant to allow otherorganizations to struggle against them. If other organizations wanted to struggleagainst Chen and Cao, they had to borrow from Geng. During the struggle meetingsconducted by other factions,ChenPixian et al.wereput under the direct andexclusive protection of Geng's men. Once the struggle sessions were over, Chen

380Pixian et al. would be quickly sent back to the Second Corps, safe and sound. EvenWang Hongwen, a commander of the WGH, could not get permission from Geng tostruggle with Chen Pixian et al. The Second Corps in effect became the bomb shelterand sanctuary for the old Shanghai power holders.°1According toChenPixian'srecollection after the CR, Geng Jinzhang offered this “protection" in the hope that inexchange, he would get Chen Pixian's support of the Second Corps. When the timecame,Chen Pixian et al.could act as“revolutionary cadres"in the new power organled the Second Corps. Even though Geng Jinzhang treated Chen Pixian very nicelyand greatly reduced and alleviated the suffering inflicted on him under the SecondCorps' protection, in his memoir, Chen still viewed Geng Jinzhang as a HuangJinrong-like ruffian and a bandit.2

After thefailure of thesecond power seizure onJanuary15,mentioned above,within which the Second Corps played an important role, conflicts between theSecond Corps and the WGH became increasingly tense and finally, armed strugglesbroke out. Since nonviolence would be the last thing that Geng and his Second Corpsresorted to, as had been demonstrated in the Kangping and Kunshan battles againstthe Scarlet Guards, they began to assault branch posts of the WGH in southernShanghai. Under the personal command of Geng Jinzhang, 14 anti-WGHorganizations, including the First Corps, the Second Corps, the Third Corps, theWorkers Third Headquarters, and Fight to the End, etc, participated in this bloody81 See “Look at the General Headquarters of the Second Corps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the NorthThrough Geng Jinzhang"(Paoshi GengJinzhangkan beishangfanhu er bingtuan zongbu),in Workers'Rebel News(Gongren zaofan bao), No.8,ed.by the WGH, Shanghai,Feb.12, 1967.82Chen Pixian, 2005, pp.168-174. Huang Jinrong (*Pockmarked Huang") was an infamous gangster in oldShanghaibefore1949.

381raid.

OnJanuary 24, when the rebelWenhui Daily requested that each major rebelorganization submit one article to praise the proposed Shanghai People's Commune.Geng Jinzhang said that the Second Corps was not willing to write such an article.Instead, they opposed the Shanghai Commune as it stood. On January 26, infuriatedby the alleged persecution of his men by the WGH, the boisterous Geng Jinzhang ledall of his 14 friendly rebel factions to burst into a meeting that was preparing for theformation of the Shanghai Commune. Geng wrangled with Wang Hongwen and otherrepresentatives, face to face, causing the preparatory meeting to take a recess. Later,Geng openly declared that this meeting was meant to discredit his Second Corps, sohe set out to totally wreck it. But the most important reason underlying Geng Jinzhangand his factions'ruining the preparatory meetings for the proposed Commune wasthat they believed that they were stronger than theWGH-led political forces. That wasindeed partly true, since almost all the anti-WGH forces had congregated aroundGeng Jinzhang and might have outnumbered the WGH-led forces. In the view ofGeng Jinzhang and his men, the Second Corps, rather than the WGH, should be theorganizationtolead thenewpower organ,or atleasthold thebiggestshareofpowerin the new government. But obviously, in the view of the WGH and Zhang Chunqiaothe Second Corps was just a subsidiary faction of the WGH; to realize the broadestunity, it was better for the Second Corps to be integrated into its parent organizationSince the WGH-led forces could not satisfy Geng's groups, Geng and his factionscarried out their own plan, that is, they organized their own preparatory meetings as

382an alternative to the Shanghai People's Commune.Very soon,Geng Jinzhangmustered no less than 48 organizations to form a“Shanghai Revolutionary RebelsCommittee of Broad Unity"(Shanghai gemingzaofanpai dalianheweiyuanhui) andtried to establish a “New Shanghai People's Commune". They even sent a telegraminforming Mao and the Center in Beijing of what they had done.

Then we shall see whose unity isgenuine."*83Towipe out thegrass-rootsforces of theWGH,onJanuary3O,at theheight of the anti-Zhang Chunqiao campaign - motivated by the Red Revolutionaries,Red Third Headquarters and Bombarding the Headquarters, among others Geng’sSecond Corps, together with the International Red Guards, and Fight to the End,stormed the general headquarters of the WGH. That night, three grass-rootheadquarters of the WGH—Nanshi, Changning, Yangpu branches were also raided bythem.84

Nevertheless, the anti-WGH activities of Geng Jinzhang and his alliesbackfired. On January 24, some rebels within the Workers Third Headquarters whoweredissatisfiedwiththeleaderChenHongkang's"revisionist”wayoflifeandwereinclined toward the WGH, made a coup against Chen.Even though Chen Hongkang'sunderground command post was stormed by his subordinates, Chen managed to83 Neale Hunter 1969, pp. 235-237.849See ^“Look at the General Headquarters of the Second Corps of Shanghai Workers Returned From the NorthThroughGeng Jinzhang"(Paoshi Geng Jinzhangkanbeishangfanhuerbingtuanzongbu),inWorkers'RebelNews(Gongren zaofan bao),No.8,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai,Feb.12,1967.4Perry and Li, 1997, p.122. According to Xu Jingxian's memoir, on learning that the Red Revolutionaries werebombarding Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan,the WGH and the Second Corps stopped attacking at each otherand agreed to jointly deal with theRed Revolutionaries.SeeXuJingxian,2004,p.64.

Chen raided the gathering and arrested all the attendees.All prisoners received harsh treatments. During one week's imprisonment, the leaderof the coup Shen Bingrong was brutally beaten and almost lost one leg. But thesuppression of rebels only triggered more and more rebellions against ChenHongkang and his lieutenants. Many of his branch posts were raided by some rebelswithin his faction. From then on, the Workers Third Headquarters never regained itsearlier strength.85

Another powerful, or the strongest so to speak, ally of Geng Jinzhang'sSecond Corps,was theRed Guard Armywhichconsisted of mostlytransferred anddemobilized soldiers throughout the country. They had achieved glorious records fromthe Kangping and Kunshan battles against conservative Scarlet Guards. The RedGuard Army was an independent signatory of the Urgent Notice as well. But it alsohad a difficult status.Since theCentral Committeeof theCCPfeared that aformidable national body of paramilitary force would compete with the PLA, as earlyas onDecember 3,1966,MaoZedong and LinBiaoissued a noticeforbiding thetransferred and demobilized soldiers from forming independent national organizations.As a result, the Red Guard Army was ordered to disband.86 To save itself from85 Neale Hunter 1969, pp. 235-236; Shen Bingrong,“My Charge and Disclosure to the Command Center of theWorkers Third Headquarters"(Dui Gongsansi zongbu dekongsu he jiefa),inWorkers'Rebel News(Gongrenzaofan bao),No.8,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai,Feb.12,1967.36Hongweijun shi fangeming jituan caozong de fupi gongju (The Red Guard Army is a Restorationist ToolManipulated by a Counterrevolutionary Group), in Huoxian Bao (Frontline News),No. 16,Feb.26, 1967,ed. by the

384becoming extinct, theRed Guard Armyhad tounite with anti-WGHforces, andwerethus attracted to Geng's Corps. But they were an illegal faction in the eyes of PremierZhouEnlai andMarshal LinBiao,andsotheirdayswerenumbered.

With all the internal rebels and weak links, nevertheless, Geng Jinzhang'sforces still managed to launch a big propaganda campaign in the Shanghai streets topromote their "Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels'Committee of Broad Unity". Theirslogans included"Welcome to the new Committee of Broad Unity! and “All Powerto the Committee of Broad Unity!87 When Geng Jinzhang was busy with a meetingabout the formation of the “New Shanghai People's Commune" based on the'Shanghai Revolutionary Committee of Broad Unity, Zhang Chunqiao sought himout and showed him a telephone record from Chairman Mao, which confirmed Mao'ssupport of Zhang Chunqiao. Zhang emphasized that if Geng insisted on forming aNew Shanghai People's Commune, that would represent a departure from the line ofChairmanMao;and if he could abandonhis alternativeplan,Gengcould act as astanding member in the Shanghai People's Commune and be invited to be seated atthe front platform at the inauguration. On second thought, Geng Jinzhang agreed.88 Inthis way, GengJinzhang and his 500,000 workers were at last won over to theWGH-led Shanghai People's Commune, at least temporarily. On February 4, one daybefore the formation of the Shanghai Commune, Geng Jinzhang convened a meetingof the Second Corps, at which he announced that the Second Corps had withdrawnRevolutionary Rebel Committee of Shanghai Machinery Institute (Shanghai jixie xueyuan geming zaofanweiyuanhui).57Neale Hunter,1969,p.246.88Ye Yonglie,Zoufang Geng Jinzhang (Interview with Geng Jinzhang”),inYe Yonglie,Seeking for theHistoricalTruth—MyWriting Career(Zhuixun lishi zhenxiang:wo dexiezuo shengya),Vol.2,pp.781-87,Shanghai:Shanghai wenyi chubanshe,2001.

The reasons for the split and internecine struggles among the rebels inShanghai, and in the whole country, were manifold. As can be seen, the old powerholders in Shanghai, who were reluctant to give up their power and privilege andsubject themselves to the masses’ supervision, did their best to sustain a powerfulconservative worker and student movement and undermine the rebels'solidarity.When the loyalist movement was strong, the strategy of the power holders was tomanipulate the movement and incite the loyalists to fight against the rebels.After theloyalist movement disintegrated because of the compelling attacks from the rebels, thepower holders'strategyshifted tolookingfor newinroads among therebels.Theyhadthe most resources to utilize, among which the most powerful weapon was funds. Thepower holders'basic approach toward influencing therebel movementwas to divideand conquer. By recognizing this,one could see through and understand thecomplicated phenomena in the Shanghai rebels’movement. This was an importantreason why some subsidiary branches of the WGH, represented by the Second Corpsled by Geng Jinzhang, not only could not merge into their parent organization, but39Touguoyici heihuikanGengJinzhangzhiliufanduiShanghairenmingongshedefandongbenzhi(TheReactionaryNatureofGengJinzhangandHisIlktoOpposetheShanghaiPeople'sCommuneSeenThroughaBlack Meeting),in Collected Leaflets (chuandan huibian,ed.by the Propaganda Team of the WGH),No.3,Feb.28,1967.

386alsoimpetuouslydefiedandfoughtagainsttheWGH—theearliest,widelyacknowledged and most influential rebel workers' organization in Shanghai

Another important reason the Shanghai rebels’ failure to unite around formingthe new power organ, can be found in the rebels themselves. Many rebel organizations.such as Red Revolutionaries, the Second Corps, and even the WGH, thought thatsince they accomplished a lot in bringing down the old SPC, they had every right tolead, or at least take a big share in the new government. More or less, all rebelfactions were obsessed with the thought of “centering on self'; and it was notunpopular among rebel ranks to think that “only we are leftists" and “only I amrevolutionary." Due to this kind of egoism, after the downfall of old common enemies,many rebel factions always found faults in other rebel organizations. The bigorientation put out by the Maoist leadership, of struggling against the collapsing"capitalist roaders” represented by Liu Shaoqi in the Center and Chen Pixian inShanghai, was greatly disregarded.9° In addition, the above mentioned line among therebels of "doubting everything"” and "bringing down everybody" also contributed tosplits and internecine struggles in Shanghai.90 To solve the stubborn issue of the split and internecine struggles among the masses, MaoZedong, when he wasinspectingNorthern,CentralSouthern andEastern ChinabetweenJuly andSeptember of1967,calledfor"combating self-interest, criticizing and repudiating Revisionism." Lin Biao, passing on this latest instruction ofMao at therally celebrating the18th anniversary of thefounding of thePeople'-Republic of China on October 1,1967,pointed out:"By combating self-interest, we mean using Marxism-Leninism,Mao Tse-tung's thought to fightselfish ideas in one's own mind. By criticizing and repudiating revisionism, we mean using Marxism-Leninism,Mao Tse-tung's thought to combat revisionism and struggle against the handful of Party persons in authority takingthe capitalist road.These two tasks areinterrelated.Onlywhenwe have done a good job of eradicating selfishideas, can we do better in carrying through to the end the struggle against revisionism." The phrase "combatingself-interest and criticizing and repudiatingrevisionism"was said to"summarizes thebasic content of thegreatproletarian culturalrevolution and of'criticism andrepudiationof thebourgeoisie'duringtheentirehistoricalperiod of socialism. This is a fundamental principle in ensuring the complete and thoroughgoing victory of China'sgreat proletarian cultural revolution. It is a fundamental principle for preventing the restoration of capitalism, andforstrengtheningandconsolidatingthedictatorshipoftheproletariatandturningthewholecountryintoagreat,red school of Mao Tse-tung's thought."(See"Combat Self-interest, Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism" Is theFundamental Principle of The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,in Peking Review,No.42 (October 13,1967),Pp.14-15.)

TheFoundingof theShanghai Commune

Even though there still existed pockets of resistance from some defiant RedGuards and workers at the end of January and the beginning of the new month, thetortuous road to the Shanghai People's Commune finally straightened out. On January31,thePeople'sDailypublishedtheRedFlageditorial"OntheProletarianRevolutionaries'StruggletoSeizePower'.This hadbeen drafted bytwomembers ofthe CCRG, Wang Li and Guan Feng, revised by Mao himself on January 30, andscheduled to appear in the third issue of the Red Flag on February 3."In thiseditorial, Shanghai was ardently hailed as a model by the Maoist leadership forinitiating the seizure of power.It declared:

Proletarian revolutionaries are uniting to seize power from the handfulof persons within thePartywho are in authority and taking thecapitalist road.This is the strategic taskfor the new stage of the GreatProletarian Cultural Revolution.It is the decisive battle between theproletariat and the masses of working people on the one hand and thebourgeoisie and its agents in the Party on the other. This mightyrevolutionary storm started in Shanghai. The revolutionary masses inShanghai have called it the great "January Revolution." Our greatleader ChairmanMaoimmediately expressedresolute support for it.He called on the workers, peasants, revolutionary students,revolutionary intellectuals and revolutionary cadres to study theexperience of the revolutionary rebels of Shanghai and he called on thePeople's Liberation Army to actively support and assist the proletarian

revolutionaries in their struggle to seize power...The storm of the9JianguoyilaiMaZedongwengao(TheManuscriptsofMaoZedong Since theFoundationof thePRC）.Vol.12.Beijing:Zhongyangwenxian chubanshe,1988.p.210.

388"January Revolution" is now sweeping the whole country.92

In the editorial, some aspects and characteristics of the power seizure wereemphasized: First, to form a great alliance and seize power from the handful ofcapitalist roaders was the general orientation at the current time. Secondly, the mostimportant condition that would secure the success of the power seizure was to buildthe great alliance of the proletarian revolutionaries and unite the broad masses. Inorder to achieve that,it was necessary to rectify such erroneous tendencies asdepartmentalism, "small group" mentality (prioritizing the interests of a particulargroup over general interests), excessive decentralization, disregard for organizationaldiscipline, ultra-democracy, liberalism, and subjectivism and individualism in people'sminds and in their organizations. Thirdly, since the overwhelming majority ofordinary cadres were good and willing to make revolution, adequate attention had tobe paid to the role of revolutionary cadres in the struggle to seize power. Fourthlyreactionaries such as the bourgeoisie and its handful of agents within the Party wouldnot be given either extensive democracy or limited democracy; only dictatorshipwould be applied to such people. Moreover, this editorial made it crystal clear that thecurrentseizure of power wasnot effectedby dismissals or reorganizationsfrom above,but by the mass-initiated movement from the bottom up that was called for andsupported by Chairman Mao. Only in this way could the state apparatus beregenerated and the old bourgeois practices thoroughly eradicated. In this regard, themass-initiated Chinesepractices reaffirmed the principles of theParis Commune92 See“On the Proletarian Revolutionaries Struggle to Seize Power’(Lun wuchan jieji geming pai de duoquandouzheng),from People's Daily, Jan. 31,1967,the English translation can be found at Peking Review,No.6,February3,1967.

389concerningthepowerseizure,astheeditorialclarified

In summing up the experience of the Paris Commune, Marx pointedout that theproletariat must not take over the existingbourgeois statemachine but must thoroughly smash it. Practice in the internationalcommunist movement has proved this tobe a great truth.Since anumber of units, in which a handful of persons within the Party whoare in authority and taking the capitalist road have entrenchedthemselves, have been turned into organs for bourgeois dictatorship.naturallywemustnottakethem overready-made,resorttoreformismcombinetwointo one andeffectpeaceful transition.Wemustsmashthem thoroughly.93

The editorial claimed that the principles of the Paris Commune, would beapplied to only a number of units -that is, they would be smashed up. But in practicetherewas basically noway to differentiate which units should be toppled and whichshould not. Shanghai rebels, therefore, virtually toppled all the upper-middle powerholders of every unit. And in the entire country, apart from some Central organs inBeijing and most national military units, almost all party and governmental organscameunder attackfromtherebels.

Yet the mass takeover was merely one step of the revolution as "it isabsolutely impermissible tomerely take over power whileletting things remain thesame and operating according to old rules." To take up the responsibility of leadingthe struggle of seizing power, the editorial called for establishing provisional organsof power that combined representatives from three sectors, namely, “throughexchange of views and consultations among leading members of revolutionary massorganizations,leading members of localPeople's Liberation Army units and93Ibid.

390revolutionaryleadingcadres ofParty andgovernment organizations."This triplecombination, the editorial held, just represented a period of transition since “thewisdom of the broad masses will be brought into full play and a completely neworganizational form of political power better suited to the socialist economic base willbe created."Very optimistically, it further predicted that the revolutionary masseswould find new organizational forms for the state organs to replace the old rotten stateapparatus and enthusiastically welcomed this.

The great mass movement to seize power from the handful ofpersons within the Party who are in authority and taking the capitalistroad hasbegun to create and will continue to create new organizationalforms for the state organs of the proletarian dictatorship. Here, wemust respect the initiative of the masses and boldly adopt the newforms,full of vitality, that emerge in the mass movement to replace theold practices of the exploiting classes and in fact to replace all oldpractices that do not correspond to the socialist economic base...

On June 1 last year,Chairman Mao described the firstMarxist-Leninist big-character poster in the country, which came fromPeking University, as the Manifesto of the Peking People's Communeof the sixties in the 2Oth century. Chairman Mao showed his wisdomand genius in predicting even then that our state organs would take oncompletelynewforms.

To arouse hundreds of millions of people from below to seizepower from the handful of persons within the Party who are inauthority and taking the capitalist road,to smash the old practices andcreate new forms, opens up a new era in the international history ofproletarianrevolution andin theinternationalhistoryof thedictatorship of the proletariat. It will greatly enrich and develop theexperience of theParis Commune,greatly enrich and develop theexperience of theSoviets, andgreatly enrich and develop

Marxism-Leninism.9494Ibid.

391

In a conversation about the editorial with editors and journalistsin theRedFlag on January 31, one of the main drafters, Wang Li, explained its gist andemphasized that the triple combination power organ was only a provisional one. Hestated,

This is the time to raise this issue....Representatives from threequarterscannotbelooselyorganized,butneed tonegotiatewitheachother and form provisional alliances of power structures. This is atemporary and transitional government. After this transition, modeledupon the Paris Commune, we should establish Beijing People'sCommune, Shanghai People's Commune, etc. We advocateestablishing people's communes in cities,which was already envisagedby ChairmanMaoin1958.Toreach thefull andfinal shape of people'scommunes, we have to go through this transitional process, and afterthat, we may still need preparatory committees.

You should prepare for this issue in theory, studying the historyfrom theFebruaryRevolution to the October Revolutionary,as well aslearning experiences from the Soviets, our past seventeen years and theParis Commune. Many aspects of the Soviet Union, in effect, areincomplete.

The current stage centers on seizing power. In differentprovinces, this means establishing provisional governments. In theseprovisional power structures, struggles are intricate, involving variousproblems,which aregenerally addressedbytheeditorial[of RedFlag].You should publicize provincial experiences, highlighting theircharacteristics.You should publishfollow-up reports of experiencesfrom places wherepeoplehave alreadyseized power.Thegreatproletariat alliance needs tobe repeatedly promoted...

People's Daily,Xinhua News Agency,andbroadcastingstations should also be communes.All should be in accordance withtheprinciples of theParisCommune.Weneed creations.Thiswill be

the greatest creation in the history of mankind.9595 See“Wang Li Talks About the Gist of theEditorial of the No. 3 Issue of the Red Flag”(Wang Li tanHongqidisan qi shelun jingsheng),inTheSpeeches of theCentral Leaders(Zhongyangshouzhangjianghua),Vol.1,ed.bythe Red Guards Liaison Post of the General Beijing GlassFactory,March,1967.

392

SinceMaohimselfcloselyrevisedthiseditorial,IwouldarguethatMaowould, from a theoretical perspective, approve of these words that Wang Liarticulated during the conversation.In other words,WangLi's illustrationsrepresented, to some extent, the historical transformation and reconfigurations thatwere taking place and envisaged by the Maoists, who not only had a clearunderstanding about what was going on throughout the country, but also showed keenforesight in theoretically directing it. And the Maoist leadership's envisioning of thenew forms of state organ did not come out of thin air. On the one hand, the significantsocial and historical course they prefigured did have its forerunners in the West. Onthe other hand, it was also deeply rooted in and motivated by dynamics and practicesof Chinese society and the revolution, especially by the initiative and creativity of themasses on the ground who were mobilized and inspired by the ideal of communism.

Beginning from the end of January, representatives from some major Shanghaiorganizations set up a writing team to draft the Manifesto of theShanghaiPeople'sCommune.In addition to major documents of the CR,such as theSixteen PointProgram and Red Flag articles, the main reference bookfor their writingwasMarx'sTheCivilWarinFrance,fromwhichthemanifestoincorporatedtheprinciplesoftheParis Commune, such as“smashing the old state machinery”and“all committeemembers would be elected as the servants of the people". This manifesto wasoriginallyentitled"From theOctober RevolutiontotheJanuaryRevolution—TheManifesto of the Shanghai People's Commune." Xu Jingxian, a writer of the draftteam,recollected,

393Upon hearing the power seizure of the Wenhui Daily, Chairman Maopointed out that this was a historical creation, a great revolution withinwhich one class overthrew another. According to Chairman Mao'sinstruction, this revolution that took place in Shanghai in January 1967was of great historical meaning. This is because the OctoberRevolution in Russia solved the problem of the broadest masses'seizing power from the bourgeois class led by the working class, whichwas a historical creation.Our JanuaryStorm moved one stepfurthersolving the problem of recapturing power when the proletarian powerwas usurped byrevisionists.Frompowerseizureto the consolidationof power, this is indeed a historical creation as well. This is also a greatdevelopment of Marxism from Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, ourJanuary Revolution could be regarded as a continuation and furtherdevelopmentoftheOctoberRevolutionundernewhistoricalconditions.96

The draft was submitted to Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan for finaltouches,andbothof themweresatisfiedwithit.Butforunknownreasons theychanged the title to “Long Live the Victory of the January Revolution!" When thewriting team was busy drafting the manifesto, some major rebel organizations wereextremely anxious to establish the Commune as soon as possible. The night ofFebruary 2, without informing Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, they formed theCommittee of the Shanghai People's Commune and decided to hold an inaugurationrally the next day. Upon learning of this, Zhang and Yao held an emergency meetingto discuss the founding date of the Commune.At the meeting, even though ZhangChunqiao argued that it was too early to form the Commune, as there were still manyaffairs that needed to be prepared for the inauguration, representatives from rebelorganizations insisted on forming the Commune immediately. As a compromise, theinauguration day was set on February 5, 1967.96Xu Jingxian 2003, p.71.

394

Theinitiators of the Commune thought that since the Commune was supposedto be a leftist provisional government, it could only be made up of rebel organizationsFor convenience and to avoid unnecessary troubles, the preparatory committee of theShanghai People's Commune decided to take the 32 rebel organizations which signedthe “Urgent Notice"on January 9 as the constituent units of the Commune, as these32 units were clearly congratulated and legitimized by the Center on January 11, 1967asrevolutionaryrebel organizations.

But several organizations that were listed as signatories of the “UrgentNotice”were excluded from being founding members of the Commune for variousreasons.For example,the above mentioned Red Guard Army,which was mostlycomposed of demobilized soldiers,was excluded. The Center of the CCP banned theRed Guard Army around themiddle of January,out offear thatit couldgrowinto anuncontrollable paramilitary national body. But the Red Guard Army not only refusedtodisband,but alsocontinued torecruit newmembers.WhentheRed GuardArmylearned thatitwas excludedfrom theCommune,some ofitsmemberswereinfuriatedand forced their way into the Wenhui Daily's offices. They claimed that since theygreatly contributed to the downfall of the old SPC, they were absolutely entitled toparticipate in the Commune. While guarding the typesetting room to ensure theirfaction would be listed in the manifesto of the Shanghai People's Commune, the RedGuard Army declared that if they were not allowed to take part in the Commune, theywouldstorm thepreparatory committee.Meanwhile,manyfactionswhichwerelabeled as economist organizations, such as “Shanghai Rebel Revolutionary

395Headquarters for Housing Difficulties,”"Rebel Headquarters of Educated YouthSupporting Xinjiang Returned to Shanghai,”"Rebel Revolutionary Headquarters ofTemporary and Contract Laborers,” rushed into the building of the Shanghai SportsCommittee, where the preparatory committee of the Commune was located,demanding entry into the new power organ. Besides them, at the end of January andthe beginning of February, there suddenly emerged more than 600 organizations, allof which claimed to be city-level political entities and they all asked for offices in theproposed Commune."/ Even alleged conservative factions, who were loyal to the oldSPC, also wanted to enter into and have a share in the Commune. The RevolutionaryRebel Committee of the City Level Agencies of the SPC (Shanghai shiji jiguangemingzaofan weiyuanhui),which hadvindicated Mayor CaoDiqiu when authenticrebel groups had struggled against him, for example, also wished to join theCommune. To its disappointment, it was driven off by the "Rebel to the End" Corps ofthe Shanghai Jiaotong University, the Shanghai Liaison Centre of the Red RebelRegiment of the Harbin Military Engineering Institute, and the Rebel Corps of theMachinery Managing Bureau. Among the 32 signatories of rebel organizations on the“Urgent Notice” on January 9, Red Revolutionaries and Bombarding Headquarterswere excluded from the founding members, as well because they bombarded ZhangChunqiao and the CCRG at the time.98

As every day many factions clamored outside the building of the Shanghai97Xu Jingxian 2003, pp.72-74.Yang Yougen and Shi Zhongkang, “Some Things on the Eve of Shanghai Revolutionary Committee”" (Shigeweihui chengli qianxi shushi),inJanuary Storm,joint issue of No.5 and No.6,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai

396SportsCommitteeandthreatenedtosmashthepreparatorycommittee,itwasimpossible to continue its works there. On February 4, the preparatory committee.including representatives from Shanghai's three armed services, had to secretly moveto another locale. But to their surprise, when they held a meeting at the new place,some uninvited factions, which hadlearned of the newlocation through certainavenues, clamored outside the meeting again. What they wanted remained the same,that is, to have their factions’ names listed in the manifesto of the Shanghai People'sCommune. Hot debates burst out among the organizations that attended the meeting.Somesympathizedwiththosefactions thatwereruled out,some did not.Atthiscrucial moment, Zhang Chunqiaoput forward a proposal to resolve this knotty issue.

Comrades! Now it is not the time for the rebels to split up and fighteach other again!Today all the leaders of the 32 organizations who areseated here did accomplish a lot in Shanghai's power seizure. Youdefinitely deservetobemembers of the comingShanghaiPeople'sCommune. We together will take charge of the Party, governmental,financial, and cultural power of Shanghai. But we should consider thefact that in a city with a population over 10 million, apart from ahandful of landlords, rich peasants, reactionaries, bad elements,rightists, traitors, spies and capitalist roaders, all Shanghai'srevolutionary people should be members of the Shanghai People'sCommune! If the forthcoming People's Commune only consisted of 30or so organizationshere,alotofpeoplewouldbeexcluded.As aconsequence, many people would be dissatisfied, and hence shakingthe authorities of our new power organ...the greater alliance weachieve, the better....Tonight, we therefore declared the formation ofthe provisional committee of the Shanghai People's Commune as thesupreme power organ after the power seizure.All the massorganizations here are the natural members of the provisionalcommittee of the Shanghai People's Commune. In accordance with theprinciples of the Paris Commune, all organizations can elect your ownrepresentatives to join in the provisional committee, and you also havethe full right to dismiss and replace your representatives....Justbecause of this, I suggest that all the 32 organizations here will be

397regardedastheoriginators,ratherthanconstituentunitsoftheCommune.It's notnecessary tolist all the32 organizations on themanifesto of theShanghaiPeople's Commune.We canjustsignin thename of a unified power organ, that is, the provisional committee ofthe Shanghai People's Commune. This can not only represent all thethree sides,the armedforces,revolutionary cadres,and the massorganizations that initiated the Commune, but also avoid the nuisancedue to the signing matter. As for those organizations outside who wantto join the Shanghai People's Commune, all of them can apply. Theprovisional committee of the Shanghai People's Commune willexamine every case for its entry later.9

ZhangChunqiao's witty advicegotfull agreementfrom the attendees,thusavoiding, at the last minute, a possible miscarriage of the Shanghai People'sCommune and possible bloody conflicts among mass organizations.

On February 5, more than one million people gathered at Shanghai's People'sSquare to celebrate the founding of the Shanghai People's Commune. Major leadersof the initiators of the Commune, military officers from the armed forces, ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyuan as the representatives of revolutionary cadres, amongother celebrities such as Geng Jinzhang, the head of the famous Second Corps, wereseated at the platform in front of the huge rally. The masses got extremely excited astwo airplanes scattered thousands of colored leaflets over the rally. At the rally, themanifestoof theShanghaiPeople's Communewaspublicly announced,

"The Four Seas are rising/clouds and water raging; the Five Continentsare rocking/wind and thunder roaring."We, the proletarianrevolutionaries of Shanghai solemnly declare to the entire country andthe world: In the great storm of the January Revolution, the old SPCand theShanghaiPeople's Committee were smashed, and theShanghaiPeople's Commune came into being!..A new style of local state organ

398Commune came into sight with a brand-new appearance on the horizon;it was born near the bank of the Huangpu River and stands to the Eastof the world.100The manifesto reaffirmed the principles of the Paris Commune:The Shanghai People's Commune, under the guidance of Mao ZedongThought, is a new organizational form that has thoroughly smashed thestateapparatuswithinwhichthepowerof dictatorshiphasbeenusurped by counter revolutionary revisionists and re-created the localstate organ of proletarian dictatorship. Its organizational principle isthe democratic centralism instructed by Chairman Mao. For the peoplethe most extensive democracy will be carried out by the Commune; forclass enemies, only merciless dictatorship should be carried out. Theleaders of the Commune, after the victory of the great power seizurefrom the bottom up,will be elected in accordance with the principlesof the Paris Commune by the revolutionary masses. At present, theprovisional committee of the Shanghai People's Commune will consistof representatives recommended by different revolutionary rebelorganizations through negotiations. The provisional, transitional powerorgan,whichis composedof revolutionarymassorganizations,theresponsiblepeople of PLA stationed inShanghai, and revolutionarycadres who stick to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, will carry outthe Commune's power of leadership... All the staff persons of theShanghai People's Commune have the obligation of serving the peopleand donothave theprivilegeofbeingbureaucrats andlords.Whoeveris detached from the masses,doing things in the masses’stead or evensuppressing the masses, or making arbitrary decisions, will be subjectto dismissal and replacement at any time.101

Zhang Chunqiao, as the director of the newly founded Commune, made akeynote speech at the rally.“All power to the Shanghai People's Commune!" heshouted.Theformationof theprovisional committeeof theShanghaiPeople'sCommune, Zhang indicated, signaled the collapse of the bourgeois dictatorshipcarried out by the old Shanghai government.

As to what characterized the Shanghai People's Commune, vice director YaoWenyuan illustrated it in his rally speech,

What are the characteristics of the Shanghai People's Commune? Wecan answer in this way: TheShanghaiPeople's Commune is a newform of the proletarian dictatorship. Under the instruction of MaoZedong Thought and the condition of the proletarian dictatorship, ledandsupportedbytheCenterheadedbyChairmanMao,itis anewtypeof local state organ of the proletarian dictatorship created in arevolutionary storm from the bottom upward, within which therevolutionary masses struggled for power from thoseParty authoritieswho are taking the capitalist road. Based on unprecedented far-rangingproletarianextensivedemocracy,itachieveshighcentralizationthrough great unity; representatives of the broad masses directlyparticipate in all kinds of works of the proletarian dictatorship, andhence the Commune has great power. It is a new local state powerorgan rising from the thoroughly smashed state apparatus whose powerwas usurped by the bourgeoisie, representing the authorities of theproletarian dictatorship. It not only represents the interest of onerevolutionary organization, but also represents the fundamentalinterests and demands of the broad revolutionary rebels and

revolutionary masses.103102 The Chinese words for “commune” are two Chinese characters,that is, gongshe, within which gong meanspublic and common while she means society and community.See“Zhang Chunqiao's Speech at the FoundingCeremonyof theShanghaiPeople's Commune”(ZhangChunqiaozai Shanghairenmingongshechenglidahuishang de jianghua),inWorkers'Rebel News (Gongren zaofan bao),No.7,ed.by the WGH,Shanghai,Feb.9,1967.103 See*“Yao Wenyuan's Speech at the Founding Ceremony of the Shanghai People's Commune” (Yao WenyuanzaiShanghai renmingongshechengli dahui shang dejianghua),inWorkers'RebelNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),No.7,ed.by the WGH, Shanghai,Feb.9,1967.

The Shanghai Commune at a Distance from the State?

Following the decision of theProvisional Committee of the ShanghaiCommune, the new power organ of Shanghai set up a delegation system, in which the38 founding rebel organizations sent respective delegates to the Commune throughnegotiations among participating organizations of the Commune In particular"conforming to Chairman Mao's great teaching of “lean troops and simpleadministration'(jingbingjianzheng),”theCommunewassupposedtoadopt anorganizationalpolicythatinorderto

In setting up the Shanghai Commune the original unit title of “department" (bu)from the old SPC was rernamed "team' (zu) - which was said to be Mao's idea.108The original Department of Industry and Communications, for example, became theIndustry and Communications Team, the Department of Organization became theOrganization Team, and so forth. This was by no means merely a name changeInstead,it waspart of efforts tostreamline administration.Yet thePoliticalPropaganda Team (zheng xuan zu) was relatively larger than other teams. The CentralPropaganda Department (zhong xuan bu), which had been dubbed the Palace of HellbyMaobecauseithadrefusedtoendorsetheMaoistpolicyand theCR,wasdisbanded. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee (RC) did not name the new powerorgan of propaganda after its disbanded counterpart, but instead called it the PoliticalPropaganda Team. To have a voice in the Shanghai RC, all major mass organizationsthat constituted the Shanghai Commune such as the WGH, the Revolutionary RebelLiaison Centre of Organizations of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, theRevolutionary Rebel Committee of Shanghai Journalists, the Revolutionary RebelHeadquarters of Shanghai Publishing Circles, the Revolutionary Rebel GeneralHeadquarters of Shanghai Medical Circles, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters ofthe Shanghai Sports Front, and the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Shanghai107The Chronicle of the Shanghai JanuaryRevolution(Draft),Nov.1965-Feb.24,1967(Shanghai yiyue gemingdashiji 1965.11—1967.2.24),Compiled by the Writing Group of Revolutionary Mass Criticism in ShanghaiJanuary 1969.

On the day after the founding of the Shanghai Commune, most members ofthe Provisional Committee of the Shanghai People's Commune assumed offices atWaitanPlaza while other held offices at the oldSPC compound at KangpingStreetand the Dou-pi-gai (Struggle-criticism-transformation) building at the No.33 WestYan'an Road.110 But the above-proposed 19-delegate plan, which supposedlyassigned19 different positions to 38 mass organizations based on the negotiation ofthe 38 originators of the Commune, was actually not carried out since many moremass organizations, which were not included in the Shanghai Commune, hoped toparticipate in the new power organ as well. As I discussed previously, in order toappease the discontent among the excluded factions,Zhang Chunqiao proposed thatall the38factionsnotjoin theCommune as“constituentunits"(zuchengdanwei)butas “originators"(faqi danwei, founding members), thus allowing more factions to takepart in the Commune later. In conditions of turmoil, it was hard to run a generalelectiontochooseofficialcommitteemembersfortheCommuneimmediately,astheShanghai Commune refused to permit some hostile factions to join in, and somefactions held a wait-and-see attitude toward the Commune as well. They harboredother plans. The head of the Commune Zhang Chunqiao, therefore, provisionallydesignated four rebel leaders - Wang Hongwen and Wang Minglong from the WGH,Xu Jingxian and Wang Chenglong from the Revolutionary Rebel Liaison Centre of109Ibid.pp.92-93110 Xu Jingxian, 2003, p.92.,

404Organizations of theShanghai Municipal Party Committee --toberesponsiblefor therunning of the Shanghai Commune. Consequently, the Commune in reality effected aconvener system (zhaojirenzhidu).The conveners,whowere appointed or approvedby Zhang Chunqiao, took charge of the everyday affairs of all the eight teams and oneoffice in the Shanghai Commune. They included,

Grasping Revolution and Promoting Production Team, in chargeof the running of the industry and communication, executed by theFrontline Headquarters; the first convener Xie Pengfei was from theWGH;

Political Propaganda Team, in charge of the propaganda work innews, press and arts, dominated by the Revolutionary RebelCommittee of Shanghai Journalists; the first convener Zhu Xiqi was ajournalist of theWenhui Daily;

Logistics Team, in charge of logistics, dominated by theRevolutionaryRebel Liaison Centre of Organizations of theShanghaiMunicipal Party Committee; the first convener Yang Yougeng wasfrom the same faction.111

As can be seen,even though rebel representatives were mostly chosen by theirown mass organizations in accordance with the principles of the Paris Commune, theShanghai Commune as a whole did not immediatelyimplement the general electionsystem of theParis Commune,which was usually seen as a core feature of theCommune model and one of its principles. Rather, the Shanghai Commune professedthat it just represented a transitional stage, and would put general election intopractice once the social and political conditions matured. However, from its inceptiorand until its supersession, the Shanghai Commune never got a chance to fulfill itspromise as such.ff? A good many sections of the Shanghai population, not onlyconservatives, but also dissident rebels, did not participate in the election of the newpower organ.The electionwas not applied to thewholeShanghai society.Eventhough theShanghai Commune actually adopted a delegate system of combiningelections and appointments,Alain Badiou still indentified the Shanghai Commune11LiXun,TheLeadership and AdministrativeSet-upof theShanghaiPeople'sCommuneand theShanghaiRevolutionary Committee(ShanghairenmingongsheheShanghaishigemingweiyuanhui lingdaochengyuan heban'gong jigou shezhi), in electronic magazine “Memory”(Jiyi),No.9,March 30, 2009.http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=11250&fpage=0&toread=&page=212Zhang Chunqiao promised that such general elections might be held at some future point"when conditionsbecome ripe."See Roderick MacFarquhar,John K. Fairbank,Denis Twitchett ed.,Cambridge History of China: ThePeople'sRepublic,Part 2:Revolutions Within the ChineseRevolution,1966-1982,CambridgeUniversityPress,1991,p.164.

406alongwith the1792-94phaseof theFrenchRevolution,as adefininghistoricalmoment ("event") of an egalitarian, emancipatory politics.For Badiou, the JanuaryRevolution and the Shanghai Commune (January/February 1967) was a major andunfinished episode because it “proposes an alternative form of power to the centralismof the party.113 John B. Starr also claimed that the Paris Commune and theCommune movement during the CR had much in common:

Both were predicated on some highly idealistic assumptions about thenature of revolution and of the exercise of political power. Both soughtto destroy the existing state structure and to rebuild a new one, and inboth cases,theideal for thenewstructurewas thesame:itwas tobe astructurewhichwashighlyresponsivetoitsconstituents andwhichwould thereby serve to break down the alienation of state from societytypical of the old order.114

As with the continuity between theParis Commune and the ShanghaiCommune,RaymondLotta,a Maoisteconomist,together withtwo other authors.argued that the “commune principle" in effect took form in several key ways:

Worker-representatives comprising the staff of the communeserved not as individualswithin a unified structure but precisely asdelegates of the mass organizations from which candidacy lists weredrawn, with these representatives subject to mass criticism andsupervision, as well as recall.

Delegates were expected to participate in productive labor inorder to minimize status differences between them and ordinarymembers of the mass organizations.

No special role or position was accorded any political force in the

Shanghai Commune. The Communist Party did not have any113 Alain Badiou, Cecile Winter, Polemics, Verso, 2006,p.300.114 JohnBryanStarr,Revolution in Retrospect:TheParis Commune through Chinese Eye, inChina Quarterly,No.49.(Jan.-Mar,1972),p.124.

407institutionalized leadership within the Commune (although, again.leading communistslikeZhang Chunqiao were objectively playing acertain leadership role).115

Indeed, almost every Commune official, or using the rebels'own words, aservant of the people,was elected or recommended by his or her own massorganization through a democratic procedure.Even Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan, considered to be two representatives of the old revolutionary Party cadres,were first recommended to the Central Committee during the January Storm by theSecond Corps led by Geng Jinzhang, the Shanghai Red Guard Third Headquarters ledby Zhao Quanguo, and other mass organizations. Mao alsogave his endorsement tothe method of nominating leaders of the proposed new Shanghai mass power organ.Trusted by fellow members of given mass organizations,delegates from variousorganizations would first represent and fulfill the political desires and economicinterests of their own factions, and then possibly those of others, such as theCommune, the Party, or the state as a whole. For instance, delegates in the Communestruggled for the interests of their own factions, asking for funds and paper to printtabloids and other things, and some even asked for motorcycles and cargo-transporttrucks.116 None of the conveners and staff persons in the Commune were elected by ageneral election or officially appointed by the Commune.Rather, they were delegatesto the Commune. Consequently, to some extent, they lacked authority and a sense ofresponsibilityfor thewholeCommune andforpolitical entities higher than the115AlainBadiousPoliticsofEmancipation":AComunismLocked WithintheConfinesof theBourgeoisWorldby Raymond Lotta,Nayi Duniya,andK.J.A.,fromhttp://www.demarcations-journal.org/issue01/demarcations_badiou.html,citedonOctober8,2009.116Xu Jingxian, 2003,p.93.

408Commune.As delegates ofvariousfactions,all of those conveners and staffweresubject to recall and replacement at any time by their own factions. This causedfrequent changes of personnel, which, to some extent, undermined the work of theCommune because this meant there was no systematic consideration and evaluation ofthe overall situation by the Commune functionaries."l/ Though there were a fewCommunist Party members, such as Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen, in theCommune, there were many rebel delegates who were not Communist Party membersand there was no official Party committee of the Shanghai Commune. Therefore, itwas hard for the CCP to execute effective leadership over the Shanghai Commune.Possibly for this reason, Alain Badiou refers to the Shanghai Commune as ademocratic countermodel to the party-state, which is seen by him as intrinsicallyoppressive.118 Badiou's view of mass democracy as being “at a distance from thestate'wasrepresented aswell amongsome of the communardsintheShanghaiCommune.

To some extent, the antipathy to the state, the Party leadership, or even anykind of hierarchy, was manifested in the“February 8 Circular Order", issued by arebel factionwithin theShanghai Commune called"TheRevolutionaryRebelCommitteeofShanghaiForeignEconomicRelationsBureau"(Shanghaishi duiwaijingji lianluoju geming zaofanweiyuanhui).Thisfactionwas a part of theRevolutionary Rebel United Committee of City Level Organizations of the Shanghai117Li Xun,TheLeadership and AdministrativeSet-up oftheShanghaiPeople's Commune and theShanghaiRevolutionary Committee(ShanghairenmingongsheheShanghaishigemingweiyuanhui lingdaochengyuanheban'gong jigou shezhi), in electronic magazine “Memory”(jiyi), No.9, March 30, 2009.http://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=11250&fpage=0&toread=&page=2118Alain Badiou,The Cultural Revolution:The Last Revolution?inPositions,Winter issue, 2005,p.497.

409MunicipalPartyCommittee(Shanghaishishiji jiguangemingzaofanlianheweiyuanhui, United Committee for short). On Feb. 8,1967, three days after theformation of the Shanghai Commune, this faction sent an ultimatum-type circularorder titled“SmashingTheOldSystemofHierarchy andProfessional Titles"(Zalandengji zhicheng jiu zhidu) via cable directly to“Premier Zhou Enlai, the State Councilthe CCRG, Comrade Chen Boda, Comrade Jiang Qing and the New China NewsAgency". They demanded the abolition of all appellatives of “zhang"(meaningdirectors), all hierarchical levels, and all the titles of administrative officials at variousbureaus (ju), departments (bu), divisions (chu) and offices (ke). They even declaredthat "we don't need any directors; all of us are equal." "All power holders should bepushed aside as they are nothing great. We can shoulder their tasks." 119The orderread,

With the establishment of the Shanghai People's Commune, a whollynew form of power organ came into being. Although the old SPCpower organ was smashed, remnants of bourgeois right in theLiu-Dengist line still exist in our Bureau.All hierarchy (dengji) andprofessional titles (zhicheng) serve as tools for bourgeois dictatorshipto rule and suppress the revolutionary masses. For a long time, thebureau directors have always been ruling the division directors, thedivision directors always ruling the office directors, and the officedirectors always ruling the masses.The higher levels have alwaysdemanded thingsfrom and pressed thelower levels.People with"zhang"(directors)titleshave always placed theirowninterests abovethose of the Party and the masses whereas the masses cannot‘rebelagainst orthodoxy”(li jing pan dao).

It should be completely smashed! For thispurpose, this circular order is promulgating the following,1.Effective as of now, all appellatives of “zhang" titles areabolished.All peoplewill be called revolutionary comrades to eachother.2.Effective as of now, the ranking system (jibie zhidu) is abolished.The wages will be distributed according to the former standard (notapplicable to those power holders taking the capitalist road). In thefuture,thewage distributionwill be enforced in accordance withnewprovisions set by the Central Committee and Shanghai People'sCommune.3. Rebel fighters and revolutionary comrades shall be urged toobserve this order.120

Althoughthe"February8circularorder”wasissuedbyonlyonefactionintheUnited Committee, it actually got approval and support from some heads of theUnitedCommitteewhenitwassenttotheCentralCommittee.Thisorderwasalsoanatural outcome of the trends of thought coming from the United Committee, whichmainly consisted of experienced lower ranking functionaries in the old Shanghaigovernmental establishments, who tended, when the time came, to rebel against theoppressive hierarchical ranking system.From the verybeginning, the UnitedCommittee was overrun with the thought of“doubting everything", “repulsingeverything” and “putting down everything". As early as on January 14, the United120ThepeialIssuoftRallyaisinHighthrtRedFlagfMaZdongThouhtThorouCriticizingtheAnarchistReactionaryThought,andBeatingBacktheReactionaryCounter-current.”(GaojuMaoZedongsixiangweidahongqi,chedi pipanwuzhengfuzhuyifandongsichang,jituifangemingniliudahui<huankan),p.6,jointlyed.bytheWGH,TheRevolutionaryRebelUnitedCommitteeof CityLevelOrganizationsof theShanghai MunicipalParty Committee(Shanghai shi shiji jiguangemingzaofan lianheweiyuanhui),theRevolutionaryRebelLiaisonPostofRedRevolutionaryFighters,and theShanghaiBroadcastingStationHeadquarters of Smashing the Reactionary Counter-current,April 12,1967.

411Committee went through its first major reorganization, at which it established anorganizationalprinciple that allcadres whowerebeyond division directors inbureau-level organs, or who were beyond office directors in the city's professionalcompanies and district-level organs, were not allowed to join the rebel teams.Influenced by this policy, some grass-roots rebel factions even forbade any politicalcadres, any Party members and any cadres promoted from rank and file workers, tojoin rebel teams since they wereyet tobe examined.Because of the exclusion ofalmost all higher-middle cadres, very often, in many units it was impossible to set upa three-in-one combination (triple alliance) in compliance with the guidance of theMaoist leadership. At one meeting, an office director was even deprived of the right tospeak because he was identified as a "power holder". Before long, the UnitedCommittee went through a second major reorganization because one ofits rebels,whohad taken part in a work team in the previous Four Clean-ups Movement, made a badcomment about a fraternal organization. Using this as an excuse, all rebels who hadpreviouslyparticipated in work teams during theFour Clean-ups Movement wereexpelled. This almost led to a political paralysis in the operation of the UnitedCommittee.Furthermore,whenaskedaboutwhotheheadsofUnitedCommitteewere,the United Committee people would reply, "We have no heads. We execute collectiveleadership.121 In particular, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of Shanghai ForeignEconomic Relations Bureau effectively rejected any proposal for a 3-in-1 combination,using the pretext that there were no old Party cadres who could be incorporated intc121 Ibid.p.3.

412this.

The“February 8 circular order”struck a chord with many like-minded rebelsand exerted immense influence.Afterreceiving this order, some units inShanghairejected anybureau directors and decidedto take care of things themselves.Someunits claimed that they had no suitable cadres for the proposed 3-in-1 combinationjust likeTheRevolutionaryRebel Committeeof ShanghaiForeignEconomicRelations Bureau.Some factions even announced the February 8 circular order atmass rallies. Thereafter, quite a few of the masses did not call leading cadres “zhangany more, and the plaques of many offices were smashed into pieces as wellConsequently, virtually all leading cadres in Shanghai were put out to pasture at thetime. Later, in order to incorporate some of the old Party cadres back into the newpower organs at various levels, on instructions from the Maoist leadership, the“February 8 circular order” was fiercely criticized. The main accusation made againstthe circular order was that it advocated “ultra-democracy", anarchism and in effectopposed the proletarian dictatorship. To refute the“anarchical"refutation of thesystem of hierarchy and professional titles,the critics quoted Mao to back theirargument, “All our working cadres, no matter high or low in positions, are people'sservants.*122 To rebuff the “anarchical" denunciation of any centralization andauthority, critics invoked Engels’ remarks on the Paris Commune that “It was the lackof centralization and authority that cost the life of the Paris Commune...And whenpeople speak tome about authority and centralization as if theywere two things to be12 Mao Zedong, The Task in the Yearof 1945 (Yijusiwu nian de renwu), in MaoZedong Works (MaoZedongwenji)Vol.3,Beijing:Renmin chubanshe,1999.p.244.

413condemnedinallpossiblecircumstances,itseemstomethatthosewhotalklikethiseither do not know what a revolution is, or are revolutionaries in name only.*123Whatreally enraged those critics most was that theFebruary8 Circular Order said that theprofessional titles and hierarchy in socialist China were tools of bourgeoisdictatorship, and it depicted all the cadres as evil-doing bourgeois lords. For them, thisrepresented the utter and total negation of all the achievements made under Mao's linewhich had been dominant in the state structure since the CCP took power in 1949

Yet is it sufficient and correct to say, as Alain Badiou perhaps idealisticallyputs it, that the Shanghai Commune represented a counter-model to the “oppressive'party-state? Probably not. First of all, even though the trend of thought that rejectedthe system of hierarchy and professional titles, and even the local Party leadership,had been fostered in the minds of some rebels in Shanghai, and had achieved a degreeof influence, this line by no means represented the mainstream thinking of theShanghai rebels.Among the 38 rebel organizations that were "originating units" ofthe Shanghai Commune, only one small faction,“The Revolutionary RebelCommittee of Shanghai Foreign Economic Relations Bureau" in the “UnitedCommittee",produced a circular order partlyin agreement withBadiou's view thatconsiderstheShanghai Commune a counter-model totheparty-state.Secondly,therewere plenty of defenders of the old Shanghai establishment among Shanghai cadres,common workers and citizens, who greatly outnumbered the advocates of abolishinghierarchy. Thirdly, nobody among the Shanghai rebels at that moment proposed to123 Engels to Carl Terzaghi, January 14-[15], 1872. (Second Version), quoted from Frank E Manuel, A RequiemforKarl Marx,p.98,HarvardUniversityPress,1997

414abolish theParty as a whole,even though many rebels didshow their disaffection andindifference toward incorporating the local old Party cadres. Even in therepresentative “February 8 Circular Order", the advocates of abolishing the rankingsystem still showed their willingness to observe the Maoist Party rule, In the futurethe wage distribution will be enforced in accordance with new provisions set by theCentral Committee and Shanghai People's Commune." Fourthly, even though theShanghai Commune had fewer, yet more effective, officials than the old SPC and thelater inheritor of the Shanghai Commune, the Shanghai RC, developed a contingent ofurban workers' militia during the late years of the Mao era, it is hard to take the viewthat the Shanghai rebels did not need a bureaucracy, a regular army and a state.Nevertheless, there could be found within the Shanghai Commune some indicationsof the beginning of the “withering away”of some aspects of the state

The ultimatum-type telegram of the“February 8 circular order”was obviouslyreceived and discussed amongtopCCPleadersbecausePremier ZhouEnlai deliveredit directly to Zhang Chunqiao, who was supposedly in charge of the CR in ShanghaiTherefore, this circular order not only influenced the CR in Shanghai, but also had amajor impact on the Maoist leadership in Beijing - and both Mao Zedong and ZhangChunqiao would pointedly criticize it, as I will go into more in the next chapter

415Chapter Six: The "Revolutionary Committee is Good":

SupersessionoftheShanghaiCommune

FactionalDisruptionwithin theShanghai Commune

January 1967 saw a nationwide movement of power seizures. Influenced bythe mass takeover in Shanghai, rebels in Shanxi, Shandong, Guizhou andHeilongjiang provinces launched the first wave of nationwide power seizures in thespring. Since Shanghai rebels took the lead in the national storm of capturing power,they were expected to constitute a new local state organ as soon as possible. If theShanghai Commune had been formed on January 26 according to the original plan, itwould have been the first new local state organ arising out of the January Storm aswell as the first such power organ publicized by the central authorities.But what theanti-Zhang Chunqiao and WGH forces had done in effect delayed its establishmentfor almost 10 days.At the same time, the Heilongjiang rebels, who formed a triplealliance withleadingmembers of thePLA and theProvincial Party Committee,suchas Wang Jiadao and Pan Fusheng, on January 10, 1967, eventually seized power fromthe old authorities. The united rebels, after effectively fighting back counteroffensivesfrom conservative forces, set up a new organ of power, i.e. the Red Rebel RC inHeilongjiang Province on January 31, 1967, which was 5 days before the formation ofthe Shanghai Commune. On February 2, the People's Daily published an editorialentitled "New Morning Lights of the Northeast [of China]" to hail the establishment

416of the Red Rebel RC in Heilongjiang Province,which was the first such organsanctioned by the central authorities.“The experiences of the struggle of Heilongjiangproletarian revolutionaries to seize power,” the editorial pronounced, “once againshows that the triple combination of the responsible persons of revolutionary massorganizations, the responsible persons of the P.L.A. units stationed in the locality andrevolutionaryleading cadres in theParty and government organizations is of crucialmeaning to guarantee the victory of power seizure." Moreover, another People'sDaily editorial that hailed the new power organ appeared on February 10, 1967. Titled"A Good Example in the Struggle by Proletarian Revolutionaries to Seize Power,” itsummed up some “fairly comprehensive and successful" experiences in the struggleofHeilongjiangas,

1. The revolutionary rebels, acting in accordance with concreteconditions in the struggle here and carrying out the Party's policy in aclear-cut manner, have united with the principal leading members intheProvincialPartyCommitteewhohavecarried outChairmanMao'scorrect line and with the principal leading members of the People'sLiberation Army units in the area to weld all three into one in theseizureofpower.2.Before seizing the power of the leadership of a provincial Partycommittee,thenewspapers andradio,asthevoice oftheproletarianrevolution, and the Public Security Bureau, as an organ of dictatorship.should first be seized by the Left so as to prepare public opinion for thefinal seizure of the core of the reactionary stronghold, resolutelysuppress counter-revolutionaries and ensure a successful struggle toseizepower.3.Firmlyrely ontheLeftforceswithinthe unitswherepower is tobeseized,unitewith themiddleforces and resolutelystrike at themost

stubborn reactionary forces so as to seize power and consolidate it.1 New Morning Lights of the Northeast (Dongbei de xin shuguang), People's Daily, February 2, 1967.

4174. The fundamental experience in the struggle to seize power boilsdown to the fact that Mao Tse-tung's thought arms the ranks of the Leftwhich use Mao Tse-tung's thought to guide their struggle to seizepower.2

This experience was, according to the editorial, “worth studying byproletarian revolutionaries in other parts of the country. Proletarian revolutionaries inother places should apply this experience creatively in light of the concrete conditionsin their own localities." The triple combination, as it emphasized, was the core of thegreat alliance of proletarianrevolutionaries.

The Shanghai Commune was formed late - compared to the Heilongjiang RCAnd the opponents of the Shanghai Commune and dissidents such as Geng Jinzhang'sSecond Corps, criticized the Shanghai Commune, comparing it to the Heilongjiangrebels, even though Geng had been invited to sit on the platform at the inauguration ofthe Shanghai Commune. They said that the Shanghai Commune lacked everything theHeilongjiang RC had achieved.Gradually, many wall posters appeared such as “FirstlyQuestioning the Shanghai People's Commune","Secondly Questioning the ShanghaiPeople's Commune', etc..3 The critics of the Shanghai Commune did not hesitate topublicly point out that the Shanghai Commune did not fulfill the triple combination,with only a twofold combination of some rebel factions and the army. Furthermore.before taking power from the leadership of the SPC, the WGH-led force did not fullycontrol the Public Security Bureaus, where people were fighting among themselvesAsfor the experience of rebel takeoversfromwithin rather than outside of the massorganizations, opponents claimed that Zhang Chunqiao had tried to impose his WGH2 New China News Agency (NCNA), English news, Peking, February 10, 1967.3Xu Jingxian,2003,p.84.

418on everyone. They even accused the Commune of excluding"the major part of'theLeft, and so forth.4 But all these accusations against the WGH-led Commune, in theeyes of pro-Shanghai Commune forces, were far from convincing. Take the first andmost important accusation for example. Before the CR, Shanghai had more than sixhundred cadres at the level of deputy bureau directors (fu juzhang), more than sixthousand cadres at the level of division directors (chuzhang), and many more officedirectors (kezhang). The Shanghai Commune did not include most of these old cadres.especially at the level of division directors and higher rankings. Apart from ZhangChunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, there were no high ranking cadres at the level of SPCsecretaries and deputy mayors who supported the rebellion before the ShanghaiCommune. But firstly, as Zhang Chunqiao held, it was the old SPC that should beheld responsible in the first place for misleading and discouraging higher-middlecadres from rebelling in the early stage of the Shanghai CR. As Zhang stressed, manydirectives concerning the CR from the Center were not well communicated to thecommon cadres by the old SPC.And in any event, those cadres should take secondaryresponsibility for not rebelling on their own initiative.

420Corps trying to achieve unity yet were rebuffed by Geng Jinzhang.。° On January 24,the eve of the founding of the Shanghai Commune, Geng Jinzhang's Corps evencompletely refused thepro-CommuneWenhuiDaily's request towrite an articlepraising the proposed Commune. Geng told the journalists: “We have no intention ofwriting such an article; we are opposed to the Shanghai Commune as it stands.*9Therefore, it was possibly not the Commune that deliberately excluded Geng's Corps:but rather, the anti-Commune factions refused to unite and cooperate.

Following the establishment of the Shanghai Commune, some economicorganizations and the anti-WGH-led Commune forces launched a new campaign toattack and struggle against thelowest rank of cadres in the whole city,i.e.peoplewhowereincharge ofstreet andlanecommittees.Many of themwereinfact ordinarycitizens and even not Party members.° Most of the cadres of the street and lanecommittees were merely rank and file political activists from the retired staff andworkers,family members of the staff and workers,or family members of soldiers.who were not state-authorized personnel. Therefore, in some sense, they were by nomeans so-called "power holders," let alone "power holders taking the capitalist road"According to the Maoist leadership's plan for the CR, these numerous “mini-cadres"should not have been the targets of struggle. The correct way to deal with thosemini-cadres that erred was to criticize them by sida (Four Big Rights), that is, to speak8Answering Readers'Questions about theSecond Corps(Continued)(jiu erbingtuan wenti da duzhewen [xushangqil),inWorker'sRebelNews,March4,1967.9NealHunter,1969.p.235.10 Neal Hunter, 1969.pp.248-249. In fact, this was not a new strategy. As early as June, 1966, the power holdershad struggled against somemini-cadresin charge of public securityin street andlane committees and somecommon policmen at local police stations.See Shanghai gong'an zhi: dashiji (Shanghai PublicSecurity Gazetteer:A Choronicle)athttp://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node4476/node58280/index.htmlCitedonJune1.2009.

421out freely, air views freely, hold great debates, and write big-character posters; it wasnot permitted to lay siege to or struggle against them. The shift in the targets ofstruggle - from true authorities, such as a handful of power holders taking thecapitalist road in the old SPC, in the old district Party committees, and in the old streetParty committees, to ordinary people merely in charge of street and lane committees,-- was for all intents and purposes a typical manifestation of “striking the majority toprotect a handful". This line was harshly criticized by the Maoist leadership as part ofthe bourgeois reactionary line. The anti-Commune forces, therefore, effectivelydisrupted the operation of the Shanghai Commune through struggling against the (infact powerless) “mini-cadres". The Commune swiftly responded to this and itscounteroffensive was to publicize a notice on Feb. 9 titled“The Notice ConcerningFirmly Following theBig Orientation of Struggle in the CR at theStreet and LaneLevel(Guanyujiedaolinongdewuchanjiejiwenhuadagemingbixulaolaozhangwodouzheng da fangxiang de tonggao)", which was jointly drafted by 23 rebelorganizations led by the WGH. The next day, Wenhui Daily released a strong editorialtitled “To Struggle Against the Cadres in Charge of Street and Lane Committees isWrong in the General Orientation (Douzheng linong ganbu, dafangxiang jiushicuole)” to condemn this. Contrary to the Commune's expectations, this article stirredup a great disturbance and caused a 3-day siege of the Wenhui Daily offices. Manymalcontents demonstrated in favor of having all authorities examined, especiallythose tens and thousands of “petti-power holders." To counter this offensive, the1Jianjue datui douzheng linong ganbudewaifeng (ResolutelyRepeltheEvilWindofStrugglingtheCadresof theStreet and Lane Committees),in Jiefang ribao(Liberation Daily)inShanghai,Feb.11,1967.

422pro-Commune organizations held many rallies of solidarity in the streets and at theCommune headquarters. At the same time, Geng Jinzhang's Second Corps musteredits supporters to protest against the Shanghai Commune for “suppressing the massmovement." Clashes between the rivals burst out here and there in the Shanghaistreets.12

By Feb. 9, both the Commune's leaders and its opponents were confused bythe lack of any official acknowledgement or congratulatory telegrams from Beijingwith regard to Shanghai's new power organ. For several days there was nothing aboutthe Shanghai Commune in the CCP organ, the People's Daily. As mentioned above,when Heilongjiang formed the new local state power organ on January 31, 1967, theCenter soon expressed ebullient praise in the People's Daily on Feb. 2. The silence inBeijing this time was soon interpreted by anti-Commune factions as a non-supportivegesture toward the Shanghai Commune. Taking advantage of this, on Feb. 9, GengJinzhang convened a meeting of the “Committee of Broad Unity”consisting of all his14 anti-Shanghai Commune factions to discuss the current situation in Shanghai. Themain points that came out of this meeting were.

1.The Center did not know of the formation of the ShanghaiCommune. Zhang Chunqiao is suspect.2. The Second Corps plans to smash the WGH headquarters. FirstsmashtheWGHheadquarters,thentheWGH'sdistrictbranches....Ifthat does not work, it will be necessary to mobilize the [supportive]workersinallfactoriestowalkofftheirworkingpositions andmake

Naturally, the WGH was “rightist” intheir perspective]...13

The idea that the Maoist leadership in Beijing had not known of the ShanghaiCommune was merely an excuse for Geng Jinzhang and his force to muster and rallyits own supporters against the Commune. As leading members of the CCRG, howcould Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan not report toMao about the course of theCR in Shanghai? As mentioned in chapter 4, Zhang Chunqiao actually called PremierZhou Enlai several times a day. Even if Zhang Chunqiao did not personally informMao, Mao himself had ample avenues of information on national affairs, one of whichwasreading thousands of Red Guard andrebel tabloids.EverydayMaorequested hissecretaries toprovidehim with numerous Red Guard publications,including tabloidsand leaflets from all parts of the country, and he carefully read quite a few of themReading tabloids ofboth conservatives and rebelswas an effective wayforMao tokeep a close eye on current events.14Accordingly, there was a clear channel ofcommunication between the Maoist leadership in Beijing and the Shanghai Commune.or other major mass organizations13 Answering Readers'Questions about the Second Corps (jiu erbingtuan wenti da duzhe wen), in Worker's RebelNews(Gongren zaofanbao),Feb.23,1967.14See,MaoZedong and theRed GuardTabloids,inTheImportant Events andUnknownAffairs of thePRC(Gongheguo yaoshi zhenwen),pp.1046-1048,ed.by ZhengYi et al.Also see Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan'sSpeechesattheOath-takingRallyto“RaisetheGreatRedFlagofMaoZedongThoughtandTakeFurtherStepstoSeizePowerintheThree-in-OneCombination"(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuanzaigaojuMaoZedongsixiangweida hongqijinyibuzhankai sanjieheduoquan shishidahui shangdejianghua),Feb.24,1967,inSpeechesof theCentral Leaders(Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua),Vol.2,ed.by the Red Guard LiaisonPost of the GeneralBeijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March,1967.

Even though the Shanghai Commune encountered fierce resistance from rivalpolitical forces on the local level, such as the Second Corps, with the potency of theWGH and support from the Shanghai garrison, no local forces - neither theoverthrownoldSPC,nor therebel malcontents--werereally able to threaten theShanghai Commune. The WGH was so powerful that its opponents even accused it ofgreat-nation chauvinism (daguo shawen zhuyi).15 The real threat to the ShanghaiCommunelayelsewhere:whatwasmost crucialwasthenationalArmy,notjusttheposition and actions of the local Shanghai garrison. To illustrate the Army's role, letmebrieflytracethehistoryofitsinvolvementintheCR.

AsdiscussedinChapter3,accordingtoTheSixteenPointspassedonAugust815AnsweringReadersQuetionabout tecondorpsjuerbingtuanwentidaduzhewen)inWorkerReblNews(Gongrenzaofanbao),Feb.23,1967.This accusationfrom anti-WGHforces contradicted their own claimthat the WGH was a mere empty “shell"without much prowess and mass support. Even if the Geng Jinzhang-ledforces outnumbered theWGH,many of their newly-admitted memberswereformer loyalistworkerswhohadjoined after the disintegration of the Scarlet Guards;theWGH had many more“old rebels”(laozaofan),who weredevoted and far-sighted revolutionaries, than the Geng Jingzhang forces. For the description of the WGH as a mere"shell",seeAndrewC.Walder,ChangChunCh'iaoandShanghai'sJanuaryRevolution,AnnArbor:CenterforChinese Studios,The Univ.of Michigan,1978.p.61,pp.131-1322.Even though the WGH had fewer membersthan the anti-WGH forces, as Neale Hunter and Andrew C. Walder hinted, the power of a political entity during theCR did not solely depend upon its numbers of members: sometimes organizational discipline,fighting will andcontinuous external aid, among others,enabled a faction to bemore powerful.

4251966, with regard to the armed forces, the CR “should be carried out in accordancewiththeinstructionsoftheMilitaryCommissionof theCentralCommitteeand theGeneral Political Department of the People's Liberation Army." Thus, at the outset.the Maoist leadership had no clear-cut visions or plans on the role and function of thearmed forces in the CR. “Non-involvement"was the initial official policy and attitudeof the Army toward the CR, yet as the CR wore on, local armed forces were firstpulled into the CR waters by local power holders on the issue of “black files". Overthe years, after 1949, the Party and police functionaries compiled political dossiers onevery citizen. In the early stages of the CR when the rebels heeded the Maoist call torebel, new political materials about people's “counterrevolutionary" actions during theCR, referred to by the Maoist activists as “black files",were added to the rebelsdossiers,which were later used by the authorities as the basis to carry out economicand political revenge.In order to mobilize the masses to participate in the CR withoutworrying about possible punishments by the power holders based on the “black files"the Maoist leadership in Beijing ordered local authorities to destroy all "black files"But there was a lot of footdragging on this and almost no local power holders werewilling to destroy the"black files".There werevery few safe places tohide the“blackfiles"in governmental buildings -where suspected offices could be stormed by therebels who were trying to enforce the Maoist leadership's order. And quite a few localpower holders, including the old SPC, on the pretext of protecting state secrets.transferred political dossiers to army barracks and related places.1° Moreover, when16 Zanduan fangeming xiuzheng zhuyi fenzi Chen Pixian shenxiang budui de heishou (Chop OfftheCounterrevolutionaryRevisionist ChenPixian'sBlackHandsholding out to theArmy),in Zhibu shenghuo(Life in

426local power holdershoped toget awayfrom the masses'struggles,thefirst places thatcame to mind were the army camps since they often had friendships with the localarmy officers - that sometimes dated back to the times of the revolutionary war. Thefirst secretary of the SPC, Chen Pixian, for example, once obtained a militaryconference hall for an SPC meeting on the eve of power seizure from his close friend,General Tao Yong. At the time, the general, who was stationed in Shanghai as avice-commander of the PLA navy, was vice-commander of the Nanjing militarydistrict, and the commander of the East China Sea Fleet. When Chen Pixian was heldby Shanghai rebels, General Tao Yong even tried to storm the hide-out and bring Chenback to his barrack. Nevertheless, General Tao's mysterious suicide stopped thisaction.17 Judged from countless such cases in the entire country, more than a fewlocal armed forces in effect became the“air raid shelters"for the targeted powerholders.

On January 19 and 20, 1967, Premier Zhou chaired a meeting of the MilitaryCommission of the Central Committee at Jingxi Hotel, Beijing.

427debates, and write big-character posters. Their proposal was met by bitter oppositionfrom Marshal Ye Jianying, who was in reality, the one principally in charge of themilitary at that time. Marshal Ye was so infuriated that he pounded the table, directinghis anger at Marshal Xu Xiangqian, who was the director of the All-army CulturalRevolution Group and had therefore ordered high Army cadres to subject themselvesto criticisms from the masses in accordance with the guidance from Mao and theCCRG's arrangements. Ye's heavy pounding even fractured his left palm. In responseMarshal Xu Xiangqian also struck the table so hard that his tea cup was shaken off thetable. In fact, Marshal Xu may have been merely carried out orders from above. Andhis table-pounding might not necessarily have reflected real support for the CR - andafter this episodeXu resigned as the director of All-army Cultural Revolution Group.This was the first face-to-face struggle between supporters and opponents of the CRin the top leadership of CCP. With these kinds of quarrels and conflicts, given Maoand Lin Biao's directive that “The great CR in military regions should be carried outstage by stage and group by group” and that “the great CR movement in the militaryregions of the first line of defense against imperialism and revisionism ...should bepostponed", the CR movement in the armed forces was limited.18 On Jan. 21, Rebelsin Anhui Province were in the final stages of planning to hold a massive rally on Jan22 and 23, with one hundred fifty thousand to two hundred thousand attendees, tostruggle with the first secretary of the Anhui Party Committee, Li Baohua. Fearing18 Directive of theCentralMilitary Commission Reiterating the Carrying out of the Great Culrural RevolutionStageby Stage and GroupbyGroupinMilitaryRegions(Zhongyang junweichongshenjunquwenhuadagemingfenqifenpijingxingdezhishi),January28,1967,inCCPDocumentsoftheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution,1966-1967,p.216,Union Research Institute,Hong Kong,1968.According to this directive,among allthe 13 military districts of PLA,7 of them, i.e., Ji'nan, Nanjing,Fuzhou, Guangdong,Kunming,Xinjiang andWuhanMilitaryDistrictswereforbidden to carry out theCRforthe timebeing.

428thatthe opposingfactionswouldstorm therally,the organizers of this event askedlocal troops to send 300 to 500 soldiers to guard the rally. They claimed that sendingout troops was a test to determine whether the local armed forces supported the CR ornot, and they ordered the garrison to respond before 14:00 pm on Jan. 21. Since therewere directives concerning the army's non-involvement in the CR at the local level,the Anhui military district had to ask Beijing for further instructions.1" Uponreceiving this report, Mao immediately directed,

The PLA should support the broad masses of the Left. From now on,thedemandsof all truerevolutionariesforsupport and assistancefromthe army should be satisfied.The so-called "non-involvement"is false,for the army was already involved long ago. The question, therefore, isnotoneofinvolvementornon-involvement.Itisoneofwhosesideweshould stand on and whether we should support the revolutionaries orthe conservatives or even theRightists.ThePLA should activelysupport the revolutionary Leftists.20

Mao took the view that since the armed forces in some places had alreadybecome involved in the CR (on the conservative side) -by keeping “black files" orhiding targeted power holders - it was time to openly demand that the troops supportthe rebels, in order to empower the rebels and weaken the local power holders, in anincreasingly intensifying state of two-line struggle.? Mao was so confident in the"revolutionary spirit"of his troops that he assumed that the army would resolutely19MaoZedongCommentontheReportby theNanjingMilitaryRegionPartyCommitteeRequestingInstructionsAboutWhetherMilitaryTroopsShouldbeSenttoSupport theRebels,Jan.21,1967,inTheManuscriptsofMaoZedong Since the Foundation of thePRC(Jianguo yilai MaoZedong wengao).Vol.12. p.197.Beijing: Zhongyangwenxianchubanshe，1988.20DecisionofTheCCPCentral Committee,theStateCouncil,theMilitaryCommissionoftheCentral CommitteeandtheCulturalRevolutionGroupUndertheCentralCommitteeConcerningtheResoluteSupportofPeople'sLiberationArmyfortheRevolutionaryMassesoftheLeft,inCCPDocumentsoftheGreatProletarianCulturalRevolution,1966-1967,pp193-197,UnionResearchInstitute,HongKong,1968.1Mao Zedong, Speech at the Enlarged Session of the Central Military Committee (Zai junwei kuaoda huiyishang dejianghua),Jan.27,1967,fromLongLive MaoZedongThought (MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.285,printed in Wuhan, 1967-1968.

429take astance against counter-revolutionaries andcounter-revolutionary organizationswho opposed the proletarian revolutionary Leftists.“Should they resort to force, thearmy should strike back with force.?22 Nevertheless, as can be seen below, eventhough the armed forces in some places such as Shanghai did by and large support therebels, generally speaking, this order exposed the Maoist rebels to endless sufferingon a nationwide scale. In many cases, the army, supposedly in support of the leftistrebels, in reality took sides with conservatives, power holders, and the pre-CR systemin general. What Mao did not see was that the Army, as a hierarchical establishment,had a conservative side, -- even though before the CR, under the orders of Minister ofDefence Lin Biao, it had gone through series of revolutionary education campaignsfor years, such as the campaign of studying Mao Quotations and the movement oflearning from “communist fighter” Lei Feng. Without fully launching and carryingout their own CR, it was really hard for the armed forces to take a stand in favor of theCR and lend a hand to real Maoist rebels.

In the case of Shanghai, even though the Shanghai Commune received supportfrom the Shanghai garrison, the actual fate of the Commune would be decided by thewhole military and political state machine. On Feb.12,1967 Zhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuan had barely arrived in Beijing by air when they were summoned by MaoZedong to give a briefing on the Shanghai CR. Apart from meeting with Mao, whatthey had to face in Beijing was the wrath of high ranking governmental and armyofficials. Just one day before, on Feb. 11, Premier Zhou Enlai convened a Politburo22 Ibid.

430meeting at Huai RenHall to discuss the principle of grasping revolution andpromoting production. At this meeting, three vice premiers, Tan Zhenlin, Li Fuchun,Li Xiannian; and four marshals, Chen Yi, Ye Jianying, Xu Xiangqian; and NieRongzhen, fervently denounced the ongoing CR. Marshal Xu Xiangqian pounded thetable indignantly, saying, “The army is the pillar supporting the proletariandictatorship, and yet you keep destroying it. You don't need the pillar any more? Arewe no longer capable? Should the army be taken over by people like Kuai Dafu?23And Marshal Ye Jianying further assailed Chen Boda, the director of CCRG:

You have thrown the party and the government into chaos.You havethrown thefactories andvillages into chaos.You are still notsatisfiedand want to ruin the army. What are you up to by doing this kind ofthing?Youhave launched power seizures in Shanghai and changed thename[of the Shanghai power organ] into the Shanghai Commune. Thisis a big issue that affects the state system. You have arbitrarily changedthe name without prior discussion by the Politburo.Again, what areyou up to? ...We read neither books nor newspapers, and we don'tknow what the principles of theParis Commune are.Please explain tous, what the hell are the principles of the Paris Commune? Canrevolution be carried out without party leadership, without the army?24

Mao Zedong, who was determined to carry out the CR to the end at that time,believed thatonlywithbigchaoscouldChinareachabigharmonywhichwoulcthen only leastfor a whileand then new contradictions would arise.YetMarshal YeJianying, like other generals and high Party cadres, was extremely incontent with thebig chaos,i.e.themasses'rebellions against the old state machine that were in23 Kuai Dafu (September 13. 1945--),born in Jiangsu Province, was a rebel student leader in Qinghua University,Beijing.He was in the forefront of the campaign to discredit and bring downLiuShaoqi during the CR.24YeJianying nianpu(Chronicle of the life ofYeJianying),eijing:Zhongyangwenxianchubanshe007,pp.959-960.The English translation here was modified from Gucheng Li and Mary Lok,A glossary of politicalterms of thePeople's Republic of China,pp.78-80, Chinese University Press,1995.

431response toMao's call.Clearly,the Generals'refusal topromote big chaos wasequivalent to rejecting any major reformation or revolution of the government, theParty,and theArmysincetherewouldneverberevolutionwithout creatingdisturbance or chaos. Marshal Ye held that chaos would only jeopardize Chinesesocialist construction. The pro-CR Maoists, in sharp contrast, held the revolutionarieswould benefit from the CR and that the chaos was only bad for enemies of the peopleand socialism, that is, those who advocated capitalism. If we take into account thesocial status of the Army before the CR, it is no wonder that Marshal Ye et al. tooksuch a stance toward the ongoing CR. The PRC was established through armedrevolution, “out of the barrel of a gun" and the Chinese Army unprecedentedlydefeated American troops during the Korea War. For this reason, generally speaking.the Chinese armed forces commanded high respect among the people. For thecommon people, it was an utmost honor to enroll in the army. Moreover, even thoughnew China achieved great social progress through the hard work of the masses and thecadres, it was the civilian power holders at various levels of government, not the army.that directlyinflicted injustice and sufferings on alot of peoplebefore and in the earlystages of the CR.And a lot of thesepeople became resolute rebels in the CR.To acertain degree, the armed forces might be the last group to feel that it was necessary tolaunch the CR. Faced with double military pressures from both the Soviet Union andU.S.A., the Maoist leadership would have to weigh the demands and feelings ofmilitary officialswhenmaking any decisions.

It was widely known in China that Marshal Ye Jiangying, who was well

432educated and well versed in composing classical Chinese poems,once acted as one ofthe major leaders of the “Canton [Guangdong] Commune". This was named after theParis Commune in the wake of the Communist-organized Guangdong workersuprising of December 1927. So why did Ye claim that he had not read about and hadno knowledge of the principles of the Paris Commune - so as to oppose the ShanghaiCommune? One of his big concerns here, as Marshal Ye himself clarified, was that thepower-seizure and the establishment of the Shanghai Commune would definitely leadto major changes in the state political system. Being the largest city in China.Shanghai had a population of nearly ten million, among which were two millionworkers. If the Shanghai Commune was sanctioned, other places would certainlyfollow suit, hence incurring a wave of communes germination all over the country.This was indeed true as many places, under the sweeping influence of Shanghai'sorganizational creation,had established or were preparing to establish communes. Itwas not likely thatYe actually did not know the principles of the Paris Commune.Asone of the organizers and commanders wholed twomajorregiments in theGuangzhou Uprising in 1927, how could he not know the spirit of the Paris Commune?One of the reasons for his angry attitude and strong repulsive feelings toward theShanghai Commune could have originated from the fact that heidentified with thepre-CR state system and considered it well-performed socialist. The mostfundamental principle of the Paris Commune, based on“The Great Lessons of theParis Commune" penned probably by Chen Boda, that I discussed in Chapter 3, is"'the use of revolutionary violence to seize power, smash the state machine of the

433bourgeoisie and practice the dictatorship of theproletariat."For YeJiangying and hislike-minded, if the pre-CR state machine was already “socialist", then why wouldthere be a necessity for "revolutionary violence to seize power"? In their eyes, suchseizures of power were nothing more than a reactionary bourgeois offensive towardthe socialist regime. Understandably, Marshal Ye's antipathy to the ShanghaiCommune reflected his preference of the pre-CR state system and his determination todefend what he considered socialism at any price.

Another core principle of theParis Commune was to dissolve the standingarmy. If the communards of the Shanghai Commune decided to carry out thatprinciple to the end, the issue of the regular army of the PLA would eventually be laidon the table, which was, of course, unacceptable or even unimaginable for old Armycadres such as Marshal Ye. In other words, the Shanghai Commune, posing aninherent danger to the standing army, cast a long shadow that struck deep chords offear in the hearts of the marshals and generals. Before the CR, the Maoist leadershiprepeatedly stressed the principle of People's War and actively combated the dogmaticline of regularizing the PLA,modeled on theSoviet Red Army and advocated by mosthigh ranking army commanders.But the Maoist leadership never held that thestanding army should be disbanded right away.And during the CR, there was nodesire to abolish the standing army - among the Maoist leadership or among themajority of the common rebels either.Another possible reason for the opposition255Liu Zili, a former Red Guard and current pro-capitalist writer, claims that he wrote two small-characterposters (xiaozibao) on abolishing the standing army and made a few copies on a mimeograph in the spring of 1967,albeit without major influence at the time. One of them read, “A standing army is the organizational form of abourgeois army...Undoubtfully, the PLA adopts the organizational form of a standing army.... Although the

434from armyofficialsismuchlessnoble.Afterthevictoryof theChineserevolutionin1949, Marshal Ye, as well as many of his fellow comrades, had enjoyed a privilegedand cozy life for many years. Why would he prefer facing potential chaotic changesand choose to continue the revolution in an aggressive, confrontational manner? Hecould perhaps just forget everything about the Paris Commune. What drove the peoplein the Party and the army -whom Marshal Ye represented— to vigorously oppose theCR could be that they had a deep concern about maintaining their own status quo, notwanting to transfer the power they wielded to others, and not wanting to giveextensive democratic rights to the broad masses.If a Paris Commune style "generalelection" could mean they might lose their power, then why should they support thedistrustful Shanghai Commune?When Marshal Ye commented that he did not"readbooks or newspapers", in this sense, it was merely a metaphor that aimed toemphasize his disgust at the CR propaganda campaign--in other words, he waspolitical content decides the organizational form, yet we cannot deny that the organizational form gives thepolitical content counterforce.The degeneration of theSoviet Red Armyis a good example....Even though thePLAis from the workers and peasants, due to its long detachment from the workers and peasants...its political attitudewill change.In order to overcome this shortcoming,it is necessary to replace it with the armed people. Of course,this change should be carried out gradually and conditionally.Marx said:“The first decree of the Commune,therefore,was the suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armed people.'Our greatleader Chairman Maoinsists on the correct principle of the Paris Commune,and creatively develops it.The greatMay 7 Directive calls for carrying out military-industrial, military-agricultural, military-educational, andmilitary-civilian work.Furthermore,during the CR,Chairman Mao calls on the Army for conducting“Three-support' and “Two-military’(sanzhiliangjun). We deeply believe in the victory of the principles of the ParisCommune...The great and trying historical mission of reforming the organizational form of the bourgeois army isan unshirkable duty for us."Such articles by Liu were probably composed after March of 1967 as the concept ofsanzhiliangjufirst appearedin the officialdocumentResolution ofTheCentralMilitaryCommittee onMakingAll-Out Efforts to Carry Out theTask of Supporting theLeft,Helping Farming and Factories,and ExercisingMilitary Control and Conducting Military Training on March 19,1967.See Liu Zili,The Story of the ParisCommune(Baligongshe degushi),http://www.tangben.com/Qianzai/paris.htm,cited onDec 21,2009.

Ye Jianying had also participated in the 1927 Nanchang Uprising, thefounding event of PLA, and as a senior member in the Party and the army, he had ahuge influence on high ranking cadres. To a great degree, Marshal Ye's interests andattitudes represented and interconnected with other high Party and Army cadres.Whatwas revealed from the meetings on January 19 and 20 at Jingxi Hotel and the HuaiRen Hall on Feb.11 was not just Marshal Ye's personal feelings toward the ShanghaiCommune and the ongoing CR. His aggressive criticisms, which clearly targetedPremier Zhou Enlai and Chen Boda, the leader of CCRG, represented and revealed thegeneral attitudes and opinions of many high ranking officials in the Party and thearmy at the time. Tellingly, almost all marshals and vice-Premiers, who had beenmilitary commanders during wartime, took a similar stance and bitterly opposed theongoing movement represented by the Shanghai Commune. This was why Marshal YeJianying insisted that the Politburo discuss the issue of the Shanghai CommuneClearly, the Shanghai Commune at the time would not muster support from mostPolitburo members. Even if the local state power in Shanghai was transformed intothe Commune upon Mao's insistence,it could end up merely as a nominal shift sincethe reluctant high Party and military cadres would not take this seriously andessentiallytook theview,that therewere nogood reasons tomakefundamentalchangesinthestatesystem.

The Huai Ren Hall meeting resumed on February 16, 1967. At the secondsession of themeeting that day,with the attendanceof ZhangChunqiao andYao

436Wenyuan, the quarrel between the supporters and opponents of the CR intensified.This new round of struggle, more or less, began with the issue of Chen Pixian, thefirst secretary of the SPC and the target of struggle among Shanghai rebels. Since themajor high Party cadres in the country, apart from those in the Army and some in theCentral organs of Beijing, had endured hard struggles from the rebels, a lot ofdiscontent about the CR among the old revolutionaries came bursting out. Some highParty cadres in Beijing such as Tao Zhu, Chen Yi and Zhou Enlai, who had personalaccess to Mao, suggested that selected cadres be protected from the masses' struggle.As a result, Mao agreed to fly those cadres on the suggested list—Chen Pixianincluded—to Beijing for protection. But when the airplane supposedly flying ChenPixian to Beijing arrived in Shanghai on Jan. 28 amid the January Storm, nobodyhanded Chen to the crew members of that plane. Consequently, Chen did not show upin Beijing as planned. Why was that? Chen Pixian himself, after his rehabilitationlater, blamed this aborted trip on deliberate sabotage by Zhang Chunqiao and WangHongwen. Yet in the same memoir, Chen unintentionally disclosed some clues aboutwhat really happened to him. According to his recollection, from the middle ofJanuary to February 25, Chen Pixian was held in protective custody by GengJinzhang's defiant Second Corps, which was fighting a tough war with WangHongwen and Zhang Chunqiao's WGH at that time."° The failure to pick up ChenPixian from Shanghai, however, enraged vice Premier Tan Zhenlin, who was a fellowcommander of Chen's during anti-Japanese war and senior and had been superior tc26 See Chen Pixian, 2005, pp.168-174.

437Zhang Chunqiaoin Shanghai at one point. Right before the meeting at Huai Ren Hallon 16 February, when Zhang Chunqiao walked into the conference room, Tan Zhenlinassailed Zhang about why he had not allowed Chen Pixian to come to Beijing. Zhanganswered that they would negotiate with the Shanghai masses about Chen Pixian'scase^′ and this answer enraged the vice-Premier. At the meeting, cross-questioningZhang Chunqiao once again as to the whereabouts of Chen Pixian, Tan Zhenlin burstout with a sharp edge in his voice.

What are the masses? You always talk about the masses, the masses,and the masses! There is still party leadership! Dismissing partyleadership, day and night, people liberate themselves, educatethemselves, and make revolution themselves.What is this? This ismetaphysics. Your purpose is to finish off all the veteran cadres, eachand every one of them....What thingis thatKuai Dafu?Heis areactionary! He concocts a picture of one hundred clowns. The aim ofthem is to put down all the veteran cadres...This struggle [of the CR] isthe cruelest one within the Party; it goes beyond any time in the past[political movements of our Party].28

Mao always insisted that "We must have faith in the masses and we must havefaith in the Party. These are two cardinal principles. If we doubt these principles, weshall accomplish nothing.""9For Mao, the relationship between the masses and theParty maintains a constructive dynamic. Yet still, Mao put the masses before the Party.But for some highParty cadres such as Tan Zhenlin,theParty should always take27The Biography of Mao Zedong (Mao Zedong zhuan）, Pang Xianzhi and Jin Chongjied.Beijing: Zhongyangwenxian chubanshe 2003,p.1481.Other versions of this conversation about ChenPixian in different books showedthatZhangChunqiaodirectlyrefused to transfer ChenPixian toBeijing.HereIfollowthe authoritativeofficialversion in The Biography of Mao Zedong composed by Pang Xianzhi and Jin Chongji.It shows Zhang Chunqiao'scooperativegesturetotransferChenvianegotiation.28Tan Zhenlin's protest could be found in various books.My summary of Tan's words is mainly based on twobooks The Biography of MaoZedong and The Memoir of Chen Pixian.See TheBiography of Mao Zedong(MaoZedong zhuan）, Pang Xianzhi and Jin Chongji ed.

438priority, and should take the leadership in everything. What ensued, naturally, was theview that the high ranking officials like him should always wield power and lead themasses. If the masses rebel one day, these officials would be surprised and bear zerotolerance with the rebellion. Contrary to Mao's aphorism “it is right to rebel", aftertaking power, the dictum for these bureaucrats would be“you have no right to rebel(against me or us)."

After speaking out, Tan Zhenlin refused to stay at the meeting. Putting on hiscoat and taking his bag, he announced as he walked out, “Let you guys makerevolution. I stop here! Chop off my head. Send me to prison. Expel me from the party.I am determined to fight to the bitter end." Marshal Chen Yi appealed to him, "Don'tgo away. We must fight against them." Vice Premier Li Xiannian joined in,

Our Party has always stressed that most cadres and most masses aregood. If we follow this, do we not need to unite 95 percent cadres and95 percent masses anymore? If all the veteran cadres are overthrown,what should the revolution depend on? There is a nationwide campaignto extort false confessions.All these began with the editorial of theNo.13 issue of Red Flag in 1966.30

Marshal Ye Jianying could not agree more with Tan Zhenlin and Li Xiannian.He went on,“Veteran cadres are the treasures of the party and state.Where does it saythat veteran cadres can be arbitrarily brought down? If this goes on, if no one canexpect personal safety, how can you expect to have any work done?31

The rebels later called the outburst ofveteran cadres atHuai RenHall onFeb11 and Feb. 16 “the Tantrum at the Huai Ren Hall". The hot debate and bitter split30 Chen Pixian, 2005, p.161.31 Ibid, p.161.

439amongthetopleadershipthattookplaceatHuaiRenHall,centeredaroundtheissuesof the role of Party, the stability of the Army, and rebels’ treatment of veteran cadresin the CR. And this struggle was an ominous signal for the Army's suppression ofmass movements -when they were later allowed to intervene in the local CR in thename of "supporting Leftists". It also foreshadowed the far-reaching and rapid spreadof bloody factional armed struggles that occurred later. Feeling the seriousness andwrathof those old revolutionariesexpressedintheHuaiRenHall,thepro-CRMaoistleaders Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Li, who attended and witnessedthis incident, immediately prepared the "Minutes of the February 16 Meeting at HuaiRen Hall" and presented it to Mao. The open opposition and threats to defy the CRreally infuriated Mao. On Feb. 18, Mao convened a Politburo meeting, at which hereleased the“fire of proletariat", to quote Kang Sheng's description of Mao's anger atthismeeting.Maocried

The CCRG executed the policy which was passed at the EleventhPlenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CommunistParty of China. Its mistakes account only for one, two, or three percent;97 percent is correct. I will resolutely fight against whoever opposesthe CCRG! You want to negate the CR. No way!... If this CR fails, I,together with Lin Biao, will pull out from Beijing and return toJianggang Mountain to fight [another] guerrilla warfare. You say thatJiang Qing and Chen Boda don't work well, then let Chen Yi be thedirector of the CCRG. Arrest and shoot Chen Boda and Jiang Qing.Deport Kang Sheng! And I will step down... You Tan Zhenlin countsan old Party member, why are you speaking for the bourgeois line?32

440capitalist restoration” at Xiaozhan Commune in Tianjing, Mao,wrote,"It is worthwhile to note that counter-revolutionary restorationists are everywhere, from high tolow rank and on every level."3 The senior veteran cadres who were involved in thetwo meeting sessions at Huai Ren Hall, were accused by Maoist rebels of creating a“February Counter-current" (eryue niliu). The mainstream historical narratives of theCR after 1976,understandably, negated such a label and named it the “FebruaryResistance"(eryue kangzheng) instead. Yet this resistance from the mighty armedforces of the PLA resulted in severely traumatic sufferings among Maoists rebels inthe whole country. Far from the verbal clash among the top CCP leadership in HuaiRen Hall, local manifestations of the so-called “February Resistance" at variousplaces operated as a horrible movement of the “February Suppression"(eryuezhengfan) of rebels by the authorities,especially the armed forces

February 1967 witnessed many tragic deaths of Maoist rebels inflicted by theArmy. The first shooting of a Maoist rebel happened in Huhehaote, the remote capitalcity of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on Feb. 5, 1967. Han Tong, a young RedGuard of the Inner Mongolia Normal Institute, who was only 24 years old, joined asit-in protest against the local armed forces’explicit support of conservatives, and wasshot to death at the gate of the Inner Mongolia Military District. Just one day beforeHan Tong's death, on the pretext of negotiating with the rebels, the local troopstrapped 1o0 rebel representatives in the Military District's yard; all representativeswere brutally beaten up. If the representatives and the enforcing rebels on hearing of33 Pang Xianzhi and Jin Chongji, The Biography of Mao Zedong (Mao Zedong zhuan） , 2003, p.1483.

441thebrutal beatings had notimmediatelyretreatedfrom the armyyard,a massacrecould have happened that very day.34 Feb. 17, the day after the “Tantrum at the HuaiRen Hall", Marshal Ye Jianying, who was in charge of the daily executive affairs oftheMilitary Commission of theCentral Committee at the time,received a requestfrom general Gan Weihan, the Party secretary of the Chengdu Military District,Sichuan province. Gan was seeking permission to arrest the Sichuan rebels. MarshalYe not only gave him a nod of approval, but also added some words, “if you rebels donot immediately retreat,you will be responsible for all consequences."This lettersigned by Ye, was soon made into a large number of leaflets and disseminated fromairplanes in Sichuan. Twenty minutes after the warning leaflets, the troops began toarrestrebels.Thenumbersof arrested rebelsvaried,accordingtodifferentsources.Yet even according to the official statistics by the Chengdu Military District reportedto Mao and Premier Zhou Enlai, at least 32,554 rebels were detained by the ArmyAlthough General LiangXingchu had tofree the detained Sichuan rebels upon Maoand Zhou's order, until April 20, the Army still held 4,699 detainees.35 From othersources,the numbers werefar more than this.Premier ZhouEnlai believed that morethan 100,000 rebels were arrested by the Chengdu Military District almost overnightBut Marshal Ye still thought that too few arrests had been made.36 Xu Youyu, a34 See Gao Shuhua and Chen Tiejun, The Thunder of CR in Inner Mongolia (Neimeng wenge fenglei), chapter 22,Hongkong:Mingjing chubanshe,2007.The numbers here are from a confidential police (jingzheng) file No.861(1967), general serial number of thisfile is NO.000508.

Several rebel-dominated provincialpower organs, such as Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and Shanghai, scattered like smallpatches ofoasesinadesert.

Around half a year later, speaking about the background and nature of theFebruary Counter-current,Premier Zhou Enlai described,

This January in Shanghai,combined with revolutionary masses, theworking class took the lead tofight for seizing power from a fewcapitalist roaders. After getting approval from our great leader, thesestruggles spread and surged throughout the country, which furtherwakened the political consciousness of revolutionary masseseverywhere.People realized that they should fall in with therevolutionary line of Chairman Mao and fight for seizing power from afew capitalist roaders, thus forming a January revolutionary upsurge allover the country. To be sure, when revolution progresses well andsurges up, those who are hindering revolution and are not reconciled totheir defeat will jump out. Capitalist roaders did not take their defeatlying down and secretly manipulated, hence came the FebruaryCounter-current.Along the way that was pointed out by our greatleader,with the effort of CCRG,wehavebeatenback this

Mao's Final Say about the Shanghai Commune

On Feb.12, just one day after the initial tantrum of high ranking veteran cadresat Huai Ren Hall, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan arrived in Beijing. According toa Red Guard's narrative, Zhang and Yao were actually invited by Mao himself, andbefore their arrival, Mao even anxiously inquired whether they had arrived or not.When people told Mao that Zhang and Yao would soon be at his place, Mao himselfwas said to wait for them in the doorway. They had no sooner arrived than theChairman asked, “What about the First, Second and Third Regiments [Corps]? Theyhave come here making accusations against you.*"41 This question showed that Maohad closely followed the progress of the Shanghai CR and favored the ZhangChunqiao-led forces more than the anti-Zhang and anti-Shanghai Commune Corps ledyouqing fan'an feng),Sept.20,1967 in East Is Red of Beijing Posts and Telecommunications Institute(BeiyouMaoZedong,Talks atThreeMeetings with Comrades Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan,February1967,in*/dongfanghong),April3,1968.Stuart R.Schram ed.,Chairman MaoTalks to the People:Talks and Letters:1956-1971,Pantheon Books,pp.277-279.

445by the obstinate and unruly Geng Jinzhang.However, this was not to say that Maowas totally satisfied with thenewpoliticalinstrumentalities of power and governanceunder the name of the Shanghai Commune. From Feb.12 to Feb. 18, just within oneweek, Mao summoned Zhang and Yao three times and talked with them for hoursThe Mao Zedong archives have been sealed by DengXiaoping and the currentChinese regime so we have no way to access all of Mao's talks with Zhang and Yadduring this week. But they probably talked about how among high Party cadres therewas growing intractable disaffection and opposition toward the ongoing CR, andespecially, toward the Shanghai Commune. What is available now is ZhangChunqiao's report and communication of Mao's instructions to the people of Shanghaiin a rally after he came back to Shanghai. Mao's directives, reiterated by Zhang.showed that Maowas very concerned about the CR in Shanghai. The directivescovered a wide range of topics related to the Shanghai Commune, such as the cadreproblems,theissues oftriple-alliance,thehistoricallessonsof theParis Communethe problem of form and essence, and the position of the Party in the structure of thenew power organ rising out of the rebel movement. The central concern, in Mao'stalkswithZhangandYao,wasaboutwhatwouldbetheroleandfunctionofcadresand the Party. In these meetings, Mao gave a final verdict on the Shanghai Commune.saying that it was better to replace it with a kind of RC in the form of a three-in-onecombination.

Thefirst thing Maogot into duringhis talkswithZhang andYaoweretheoretical issues, namely, the political and ideological foundation of the ongoing CR

446Holding that “Facts always come first, then concepts*42and observing theflyingleapof the current CR, Mao suggested that the CCRG ponder over and write about thetheory of “revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat." For him, the nature ofChinese central power was the dictatorship of the proletariat and Chinese societywassocialist. Generally speaking, for Mao, China's power had been in the hands of theproletariat in the previous 17 years, and only “a portion of the structure of proletariandictatorship [the Department of Culture, the Central Propaganda Department, forexample] has been usurped and no longer belongs to the proletariat, but to thebourgeoisie.*43 Thus, the masses had to be mobilized to make revolution in order totake back those sections of power that had been usurped by the bourgeoisie, i.e. thecapitalist roaders represented by the Liu-Dengists. Under this theoretical premise, theCR never meant to be a full-scale assault on all officials and the entire existing powerstructure. The slogan of “thoroughly ameliorate the dictatorship of the proletariat'(chedigaishanwuchanjiejizhuanzheng)put outby somerebelgroupsinHu'nanprovince, Mao said, was wrong and reactionary, as it aimed at toppling the existingdictatorship of the proletariat and replacing it with that of the bourgeoisie. 44That is,42Mao Zedong,“A Talk on theDiscussion of the Ten-point Directive Concerning the Great Cultural Revolution inFactoriesandMines andtheTen-pointDirectiveConcerningtheGreatCulturalRevolutionintheCountryside'(Taolun gongkuang shitiao shi de jianghua),Dec.6th,1966,fromLongLiveMaoZedongThought(MaoZedongsixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.280,printed inWuhan,1967-1968.43MaoZedong,Talks at ThreeMeetings With Comrades Chang Ch'un-ch'iao And YaoWen-yuan,February1967,SelectedWorks of MaoTse-tung:Vol.IX,published inIndiabyKrantiPublications,Secunderabad,andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,cited October 9,2009.4This slogan could be traced back to October 17,1966,when Li Wenbo, a physics student in Beijing NormalUniversitywrote a wall poster titiled“The Commune wasnoLonger aState in thePoperSense of theWord”(Gongshezaoyibushi yuanlaiyiyi deguojiale),inwhich Liadvocated an“innovating socialist system”and“ameliorating the dictatorship of the proletariat".This was one of the earlest documents of a so-called“new trendof thought'(xin sichao). See Yin, Hongbiao, Shizong zhe de zuji: wenhua da geming qijian de qingnian sichao(Footprints of theMissing:Thoughtsof theYouth duringtheCulturalRevolution),HongKong:Zhongwen daxuechubanshe,2009. pp.85-90.Part of Li Wenbo's poster read:“This kind of leading organ takes the same form as thatof the machinery of bourgeois dictatorship in the old society. It is the hotbed and social foundation ofbureacraticism and slavism....Since theleading organ stillfollows the modes of bourgeois society(or underwentsome innovation),people carry out socialpracticeunder suchasocial thought."SeeBazaofanbingtuan

447therealgoalof"thoroughly ameliorating”was toovercomethedictatorshipof theproletariat.The correct wording,he suggested, should be"PartiallyAmeliorate theDictatorship of the Proletariat" (bufen gaishan wuchanjieji zhuanzheng).45 Inaddition,Maowarned that the slogan of “doubt everything and overthrow everythingwas equally reactionary. In chapter 4, I discussed the influence of this slogan on theRed Guards in Shanghai during their anti-Zhang Chunqiao campaign. In order toillustrate his viewpoints toward this “overthrowing everything” trend of thought, Macpurposely mentioned the ultimatum-style February 8 Circular Order by some rebelsAs I discussed in the beginning of this chapter, a department of Shanghai People'sCommittee demanded that Premier Zhou Enlai should abolish all heads46 On this,Maocommented,

TheShanghaiPeople's Committee demanded that thePremier of the

StateCouncilshould do awaywith allheads.Thisisextreme“shengwulian”shidefandongsichaonachulaishizhong(ExposetheShengwulian-styleReactionaryThought oftheRebelRegiment toPublicView),inJinggangshan,March 27,1968,ed.byBeijing shifan daxue MaoZedongsixiang hongweibing jianggangshan zhandou tuan. Moreover, Li held that“the principles of the Paris Communehave two main points: No.1,the officials’salaries cannot surpass that of a worker.No.2,the people have the rightto dismiss officials at ant time....The goal of the CR is to realize the principles of the Paris Commune." See Yin,Hongbiao 2009, p.88. In addition, in his notebook,Li Wenbo stated that “"the current political system of ourcountry is thebridge and springboard for capitalist restoration,”and that“it is a must to smash the current politicalsystem ofour country."SeeBingtuan“xin sichao"deyaohai shi dianfuwuchan jiejizhuanzheng(TheKeyIssueof the“New Trend of Thought'of the Rebel Regiment is to Topple the Dictatorship of the Proletariat),inJinggangshan,March 27,1968.Later,LiWenbo and others composed another wall poster titiled“Dadagaishanwuchan jieji zhuanzheng,dada gexin shehuizhuyi zhidu'(GreatlyAmeliorate theDictatorshipof theProletariat,GreatlyInnovate the Socialist System).See Zhaohuan niuguisheshenfupi zibenzhuyi dexuanyanshu—pingbingtuan“xinsichao”daibiaozuo“dadagaishan wuchanjiejizhuanzheng,dada gexin shehuizhuyi zhidu"(AManifesto for Conjuring up Monsters and Demons to Restore caitalism—On the Reprentative Work of the RebelRegiment's“NewTrend of Thought”“GreatlyAmeliorate theDictatorshipof theProletariat,GreatlyInnovate theSocialist System"), in Jinggangshan,April 6, 1968. Hu'nan's similar thought could be influenced by the earlier"NewTrendofThought"inBeijing45ZhangChunqiao and YaoWenyuan'sSpeechesat the Oath-taking Rally to“Raise theGreat RedFlag of MaoZedongThought and TakeFurtherSteps toSeizePowerintheThree-in-OneCombination"(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuanzaigaojuMaoZedongsixiangweidahongqijinyibuzhankaisanjieheduoquan shishidahuishangdejianghua),Feb.24,1967,inSpeechesof theCentralLeaders(Zhongyang shouzhangjianghua),Vol.2,ed.by theRed Guard Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory, Beijing, March, 1967.46 This in fact referred to in the“February 8 circular order”issued byThe Revolutionary Rebel Committee ofShanghaiForeignEconomicRelationsBureau",which camefromadepartment of theoldShanghaiPeople'sCommittee. As I discuss in the foregoing part of this chapter, when this order was released on Feb. 8, this factionin realitywas apart of thenewpower organ of theShanghai Commune.[HereMaocalled thisfactionwith itsprevious affiliation.??]

448anarchism,anditisthemostreactionary.Ifinsteadofcallingsomeonethe “head" of something we call him “elderly” or “assistant", thiswould really be only a formal change. In reality there will still be"heads". It is the content which matters....The slogan of "doubteverything and down with everything"is reactionary. Those who wantto doubt everything and overthrow everything are bound to head in theopposite direction, and will be overthrown in a matter of days. Wehave here some units which won't even have deputy section chiefs.Peoplewho don't want tohave deputysection chiefs cannot last morethanafewdays.47

For Mao, nothing could be accomplished without authority or leadership. Anywell-organized modern society, without authority, would fall into disorder or evenchaos. That might be one of the reasons that Mao did not strongly oppose gerenchongbai(the adoration of theindividual;or as it is usuallyreferred toinWesternsociety, a cult of the personality or personality cult).*° Mao clearly differentiatedbetweengerenchongbai(the adorationof theindividual)andgerenmixin(thecult ofthe individual, the superstition of the individual, or personality cult). He expoundecthat the latter should be opposed as it left no room for criticism, but even though oneheld an attitude of “geren chongbai" toward somebody, one could still criticize himor her if they erred. Later, during the turbulence of the CR, the Maoist leadershipstrong promoted Engels’work “On Authority" in order to combat the “anarchist"tendency in the rebel movement. The thought of “doing away with" all heads amongsome rebels, in the eyes of Mao, was nothing other than a manifestation of such"anarchism". This kind of “anarchist" thought was found not only in the Shanghai47MaoZedong,Talks at ThreeMeetings With Comrades Chang Ch'un-ch'iao And YaoWen-yuan,February 1967,SelectedWorksof MaoTse-tung:Vol.IX,publishedinIndiabyKrantiPublications,Secunderabad,andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.48In English,“geren chongbai" is usually translated as “"the cult of personality". Indeed, the Chinese word“chongbai”does has a religious connotation,but in everyday usage,it often merely means“adoration",“stronglove",or“deep respect",as people often say that"wo chongbai ta",which just means“I adore (respect)him".

449Commune, according to Mao,but also in some people in Beijing who advocatedabolishing deputy section chiefs. Since there must be leaders to get the industrialsociety running, why should the titles be abolished? The fact that essence is moreimportant than form was always one of the premises of Mao's political philosophyMao was so dissatisfied about this ultimatum from the above mentioned Shanghairebel faction to the Center that he instructed Zhang Chunqiao toset the outstandingaccountwith thisfaction.ForMao,theissues thatwerestilloutstanding andhad tobesettled included the bombardment of Zhang Chunqiao by the Red Revolutionaries, theopposition of the Shanghai Broadcasting RC against military seizure of the radiostations, and the rebels' opposition toward military control at Longhua Airfield ofShanghai.49

When he talked with Zhang and Yao, Mao also expressed a lot of concernsabout theShanghai Red Guards.As I discussed in chapter 4,when conservativeworkers were incited by the old Shanghai bureaucrats toslow down or walk off theirjobs, the Shanghai harbor, and especially the docks, were almost paralyzed, and manyrebellious students, together with rebel workers, volunteered to work at the harbor andother crucial places,fillingpositions thathadbeenleft unattended.Against such abackground, Mao asked Zhang,“Are Tongji University [Red Guards] still at thestations and docks?? Zhang Chunqiao replied that when he accompanied Kang Shengto the docks, the students were still there.50 *That's excellent," Mao responded,49 Some people such as Cao Weiping believe that theses“outstanding accounts” could be made up by ZhangChunqiao or a distortion of Mao's words. Because the official version of these talks has not been released, I cannot reach a conclusion on this. Yet apart from the issue of the Red Revolutionaries, I do not see how ZhangChunqiaocould havebenefited at allfrom settling accountwithhisfellowrebels.50ZhangChunqiao andYaoWenyuan'sSpeechesat theOath-takingRally to“Raise theGreat RedFlagof Mao

450satisfied with this answer.And he then continued,“in the past the students had notreally united with the workers. Only now have they really united with them." Thiscompliment of Shanghai Red Guards was at the same time a euphemistic criticism ofthem,pointingoutthat thefuture of thestudentmovement layinits alliancewith theworkers’movement.PreviousconfrontationsbetweentheRedRevolutionaries ofShanghai and the pro-Zhang forces led by the most influential rebel workersorganization, the WGH, were understandably interpreted by Mao as an indication thatthe Shanghai Red Guards were going on the wrong track. Mao was especially notconfident about letting the Red Guards run Shanghai, China's largest urban andindustrial center. He explained,

Itwouldbeverydifficultfor a collegestudentwhohasjustgraduatedor one who hasn't yet graduated, to lead a municipality or to managethe Shanghai municipality. I don't think he would be qualified to be acollege president either. In the case of college president, schoolconditions are complex, especially to one who has just graduated orhasn't yet graduated. In my estimation, he may not even qualify to be adepartment head. A department head must have some scholarship!Since you haven't yet completed your academic work, or have onlyjust graduated, you have no teaching experience and no experience inadministering a department.

It was quite understandable that Mao thought that the recently-mobilized rebelstudents lacked the experience in administrating and operating a municipality, even acollege. Even though many rebel students and workers went to key production unitsZedongThoughtandTakeFurtherStepstoSeizePowerintheThree-in-OneCombination"(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuanzaigaojuMaoZedongsixiangweidahongqijinyibuzhankaisanjieheduoquanshishidahuishangdejianghua),Feb.24,1967,in Speeches of the CentralLeaders (Zhongyang shouzhang jianghua),Vol.2,ed.by theRed Guard Liaison Post of the General Beijing Glass Factory, Beijing, March, 1967.51MaoedongTalsatThreeMetingswitComradesChangCh’u-chiaandYaoWn-uanebruary97SelectedWorks of Mao Tse-tung:Vol. IX,published in India byKranti Publications,Secunderabad,andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.

451such asdockstoreplacetheloyalistworkerswhohadwalkedoffthejoband theydidaccomplish a great deal, but given the severe shortage oflaborers, production inShanghai unavoidably shrunk. In such a situation, Shanghai's production would notquickly pick up and recover without appropriate and careful political arrangement tostabilize the city. At the moment when Mao talked with Zhang and Yao, even thoughloyalist workers’organizations were publicly disintegrated, the Shanghai Communestill faced stubborn resistance from the opposing rebel factions that sometimes eventhreatened tostage a general strike.As a result, there were still quite a few objectionsslowdowns, and disruptive activities, openly or secretly incited or influenced by theold bureaucrats and their massive supporters who did not approve of the new politicalpower. Mao was highly concerned with the slowdowns and strikes that had actuallyparalyzed Shanghai in January. If production in Shanghai did not recover quickly, thepower of the opponents of the CR would soon be strengthened, not only in Shanghaibut also all over the country. This is because this would give these anti-CR forces anexcuse to accuse the revolution of destroying production, an accusation that had thepotential to eventuallyput thewholeCR atrisk.

Mao's comments about rebel students’notbeing capable of running thegovernment, however, might not have been so convincing. Nobody can run agovernment without practice. Nobody is born a politician. What's more, even if therebel students alone could not run a government smoothly, then how about the rebelworkers, and what if the rebel workers and students jointly running a government?Clearly, the true purpose of Mao's concern and criticism of the Shanghai Red Guards

The main purpose of the CR, for Mao, did not aim at bringing down all the oldcadres and replace them with a group of new cadres risingfrom the rebel movement --whocouldbecomenewrevisioniststhemselvesiftheyrebelledjustfortheirownpersonal interests and ceased to serve the people. The true goal of the CR, insteadcouldbe a great educational campaign that intended to transform the worldviews ofpeople and cadres fundamentally - to quote Mao's adage, to “combat self-interest,criticize and repudiate revisionism."For the cadres who had erred, therefore, Mao'spolicy was always to ask them to learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, andhis approach to such cadres was to“cure the sickness to save the patients". Most ofthe old Party cadres were not intrinsicallybad people and many of them had proventhemselves in the past, serving thepeople during wartime. It was possible for thedegenerated cadres to rectify their mistakes and make new contributionsfor the52MaoZedong,Talks atThreeMeetings With Comrades Chang Ch’un-ch'iao and YaoWen-yuan,February 1967,Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung: Vol. IX, published in India by Kranti Publications, Secunderabad, andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.

453people once they returned to Mao's line. This was the reasoning behind Mao insistingthat over 95 percent of the cadres was good or relatively good. The targets of struggleMao contended, should be set to the big fishes, a handful of power holders taking thecapitalist road. It should not be the common cadres, not to mention the lowest rank ofcadres in neighborhoods whowere in charge of street and lane committees.So inthese talks with Zhang and Yao, Mao completely agreed with the Wenhui Daily's pointof view of not making neighborhood cadres the target of struggle in the CR. Moreover.Mao was also afraid that the slogan of “down with the diehard elements who upholdthe bourgeois reactionary line” would shift the spearheads of struggle to numerouscommon cadres. Therefore, Mao suggested not using this slogan anymore.

Out of the dissatisfaction toward the power structure of the ShanghaiCommune, Mao suggested using as a model the Heilongjiang and Shanxi powerstructure -combining the revolutionary rebels, the army, and the revolutionary cadresinto the new power organ. This was Mao's famous “Triple Alliance"(sanjiehe)formula.And it seems that Mao wanted to have the masses play a crucial role in thenew power organs. He urged Shanghai to learn from Guizhou's new power organ,withinwhichthemajorityof therepresentativeswerefromrebelorganizations.

For the purpose of seizing power the ^Three-way Alliances'wereessential. Fujian, Guizhou and Inner Mongolia did not present bigproblems, though there might be a little disorder there. In Shanxi atpresent 53 per cent were revolutionary masses, 27 per cent army, and20 per cent cadres from various organs. Shanghai ought to learn from

them.5353Ibid.

Even though it was the Heilongjiang rebels who first produced the "TripleAlliance"(sanjiehe) formula during the CR as a remedy to the old establishment, itwas by no means a totally alien thing in the course of Chinese revolution. It wasrather a Maoist tradition to empower the democratic rights of the masses by institutingsuch an organizational structure.As early as the anti-Japanese war time in Yan'an, inorder to unite all possible anti-Japanese forces, Mao proposed a three-thirdsgovernmental system (san san zhi)in the communist-controlled areas.Beginningfrom 1940, these kinds of anti-Japan democratic regimes consisted of three kinds ofpeople: one third communists, one third non-communist supporters, and one thirdwavering forces who were“fence-straddlers”(zhong jian pai, including NationalistParty members). Dong Biwu, a senior cadre of the CCP, elaborated on this in 1945,

TheCCPcarriesouta3-3systeminliberatedareas,nomatter ingovernments, or in Representative Committees (can yi hui). What isthe 3-3 system? Namely, whether among the representatives elected bythe people at various levels'Representative Committees, or among alllevels of governmental committees’members elected by all levels'Representative Committees, according to the CCP's own stipulation,the CCP quota cannot exceed one third. If the CCP members gobeyond that among the elected representatives or governmentalcommittees’ members, some of them will resign, giving their positionsto those non-communists who get the most votes second to thecommunists. What is the purpose of this system? It is to oppose thepractice of the party doing things on others' behalf, to oppose one partydictatorship, and to better unite and cooperate with people from allparties and non-party people from all classes. The CCP advocatesdemocratic politics and opposes one party dictatorship. The CCP itselfdoes not do things on others'behalf, and does not run a one partydictatorship. All the measures above guarantee that the people havedemocratic rights and that the government is democratic. This is the

455best democratic system.54AnotherseniorCCPleaderXieJuezaibelievedRevolution needs a strong party leadership. Yet it is very easy for thedominant party to do things on others'behalf. If so, not only will thebroad masses not be satisfied with the ruling party, but it is also notgood for the party itself. [Consequently,] such a party cannot get thepeople's support and is doomed to fail.55

In addition to the practical need to unite all possible forces to fight against theJapanese invaders, the 3-3 system, a rudimental form of the triple combination, wasnothing less than the logical extension and practice of Mao's theory of the NewDemocracy. This theory which Mao developed in the spring of 1940 put forward thatthe NewDemocratic Revolution should overcome the one-class-dictatorship of theOld Democracy and unite all revolutionary classes (in the sense of anti-foreigninvaders at that time) to execute joint dictatorship. This functioned as an effectiveweapon against Jiang Jieshi's “one party, one leader” policy at the time. And in 1967amid the storm of rebel power seizure from old authorities,it could have been aninspiration for the Maoists to propose and favor the three-in-one combination, that is.committees which consisted of the masses, the army, and the cadres.After all, thehistorical 3-3system inYan'an not only insured the CCP's leadership in theNewDemocratic governments, but more importantly, incorporated and united all possiblerevolutionary political forces to defeat the common foreign enemies. Participation and54 Dong Biwu,The Basic Policy of CCP(Zhongguo gongchandang de jiben zhengce), Selected Works of DongBiwu(Dong Biwu xuanji), Beijing:Renimg chubanshe, 1985. p.112.55XieJuezai,TheTheory andPractice of 3-3System(Sansanzhi delilun yu shiji),inSelectedResearchMaterialsofYan'an'sDemocraticMode(Yan'anmingzhumoshiyanjiuziliaoxuanbian),p.142,Xibei daxuechubanshe.2004.

Other applications of the three-in-oneformulationbefore the CR canbe tracedback to the four clean-ups movement (siqing yundong). In January 1965, upon Mao'sinsistence,the CCPissued a notice,“SomeProblems CurrentlyArisingin theCourseoftheRuralSocialistEducationMovement"(usuallyreferredas23Articlesasitconsisted of 23 main points). This was aimed at redirecting the orientation of theclean-ups movement - changing the target of this from struggling grass-root cadresand common peasants upon whom Liu-Dengists aimed the spearheads, to those whoheld authoritative positions within the Party and were taking the capitalist road, Thisnotice called for “uniting more than 95 percent of our people and 95 percent of ourcadres" since“the great majority of our cadres want to take the socialist road, butthere are some among them who have but a hazy knowledge of the socialist revolution.who employ personnel improperly, who are haphazard about checking up on workandwhocommit themistakeofbureaucratism."Italsocalled onpower seizures ifnecessary,“where the nature of the mistakes is serious—where leadership authorityhas been taken over by alien class elements or by degenerate elements who have shedtheir skin and changed their nature—authority must be seized, first by struggle andthen by removing these elements from their positions." One of the principles ancwork methods, it stressed, was that "within the movement as a whole, provincial

457special district, and county level party committees and work teams, relying on thegreat majority of the masses and cadres (including cadres who have cast aside theirmisgivings and doubts), must gradually carry out the “3 unifications’ with respect tothe masses, cadres, and work teams." In order to prevent the“capitalist roaders" fromresorting to armed force to suppress the mass movement, in places where power mustbe seized, or under conditions where the peoples'militia organization was criticallyimpure, it was suggested that “we should adopt the method of turning over theweapons and ammunition of the peoples' militia to reliable elements among the poorand lower-middle peasants." To deal with the power transition before the Party branchwas reconstituted after a power seizure, it further clearly stated that all power couldgo to the non-communist yet pro-socialist organizations,"in those places wherebasic-level organizationshave atrophied or becomeparalyzed,andbefore a newleadership nucleus has been formed, we may implement [the policy of] all power tothe poor and lower-midle peasants? associations.*56

Although the four clean-ups movement was launched in the cities, the majorbattlegrounds of this movement were in the rural areas. The subsequent CR, instead.set themajor battlegrounds in thecities on a muchlargerscale.Infact,as canbeobserved, during the CR, the Maoist leadership adopted many concepts, viewpointsand work methods arising from the four clean-ups movement of 1962-1966. Howeverthere are few studies on the relationship between the four clean-ups movement and56SomeProblemsCurrentyArisingintheCourseof theRuralSocialistEducationMovement,January141965,the English translation modified from Ssu Ching:TheSocialist Education Movement of1962-1966by RichardBaum and Frederick C.Teiwes,University of California,Berkeley,1968,the original Chinese text can be found inLongLiveMaoZedong Thought (MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.280,printed inWuhan,1967-1968.

458the CR. To some degree, the CR embodied,I'd like to argue, an extensiontheoretically and practically, of the four clean-ups movement. For example, onepopular slogan at the early stage of the CR was to“defend the fruits of the fourclean-ups movement, launch the great proletarian cultural revolution.?" And quite anumber of rebels actually came from the four clean-ups movement. Whether commoncadres or the masses, many of the would-be CR rebels were actually suppressed byLiu-Dengist work teams or local power holders during the four-clean-ups movement.Nie Yuanzi, for instance, one of the signatories of the first “Marxist-Leninists wallposter” which was praised by Mao as “the manifesto of the Paris Commune in 1960s",was treated as object of struggle set by Beijing University and Beijing PartyCommittee, as she had raised criticism toward the authorities of Beijing University. Inaddition, theprescriptionin the 23 articles that militia weaponsin the places of powerseizureshouldgotoreliableelements amongthepoor andlower-middlepeasantswasalso anticipated in the policy of the Army's “supporting Leftists” and the policy of"arming Leftists” in the storm of power seizures during the CR. More importantly, thetriple combination ("3 unifications') of the masses, cadres, and work teams in the fourclean-ups movement would reemerge and be directly applied to the new power organstructure in the CR -with in this case the work teams being replaced with the Armysince the work teams sent out by the Liu-Dengists in the early stage of the CR becametheir tools for suppressing the mass movements.Finally, the 23 articles claimed thatalthough all power could go to the poor and lower-middle peasants’ associations in thefour clean-ups movement, such an arrangement would only be temporary and

459transitional.Onceconditions allowed,therectifiedandreconstitutedPartycommitteesshould replace the temporary mass power organs. This stance, as it were, prefiguredthe destiny of the popular power organs arising from the storm of power seizureduring the CR such as theShanghai Commune and to some degree the RCs atvariouslevels.

Many Shanghai rebel leaders were not communist party members and some ofthem may not have been socialists or communists at all. Therefore, if the Shanghairebels insisted on following the Commune model based on general elections, aprinciple of the Paris Commune, then it was quite possible for the ShanghaiCommune to elect a regime in which communists were in the minority. Consequentlya touchy issue would emerge regarding the relationship between the Commune andthe CCP. In a general election system, power comes from the voters. If communistswere in the minority within such a communal regime, how should the masses followthe CCP?Apparently,the CCP would lose its legitimacy and authority in such aregime in which the communists are in the minority. Of course, Trotskyites, amongothers, would acclaim it a great thing to replace the “degenerated" Party with aself-governingworkers'regime.Butcansuchaself-governingworkers’regimeguarantee a socialist direction and nature of the society?If the workingpeople's classconsciousness is not mature enough to realize that the emancipation of the workingclass is intimatelyinterconnectedwith theemancipation of thewhole of mankind andinstead, the masses only strive for their own interests, the answer to this question is no.Virtually all the so-called self-governing workers’ power organs, from Yugoslavian

460workers’self-governance in factories during the Tito era toPoland's Solidaritymovement, frankly speaking, eventually became tools of unionism and economism -as Lenin argued in his time about similar cases - or tools of capitalist restoration.57Similarly, in the January Storm of Shanghai in 1967, a huge amount of workers carednothing about the general orientation of political struggles. They just devoted theirefforts to economist demands, disregarding the fact that, these kinds of actions, spreadto many different localities within a short time might jeopardize the worker-peasantalliance and the construction of socialism for the whole state.Under suchcircumstances, if there is not strong leadership, politically and/or organizationally, thewhole state economy can collapse and a bloody civil war could be staged. MaoZedong as a devoted Leninist,at such a critical conjuncture,would not hesitate tofight to retain theParty.He argued,

If everything were changed into communes, then what about the party?Wherewouldweplacetheparty?Amongcommunecommitteemembers are both party members and non-party members. Wherewould we place the party committee? There must be a party somehow!Theremustbe a nucleus,nomatter whatwe callit.Beit called theCommunist party, or social democratic party, or Guomindang, orI-guan-dao[a daoist religion cult], it must have a party. The communemust have a party, but can the commune replace the party?8

Mao didnot think that the class-consciousness of the Chineseworkershadmatured enough, at theheight of the CR,to dissolve the existingParty.It was too57 Perhaps, unions in the United States seem even more so, as they weirdlyretain traces of early 2Oth centurysocialist idealswhile beingfiercelynationalistic and exclusionary.58MaoZedongTalksathreeMeetingsWitComradeChangCh’un-ch'iaoAndYaoWenyuanFruary97Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung: Vol. IX, published in India byKranti Publications, Secunderabad, andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.

461soonforthecommunistparty,asthevanguardoftheworkingclass,tofadeawayinhuman history. It was true that in the CR, Mao advocated that"the working class mustexercise leadership in everything". But as we can see, this was more a call for theworkers to activelyparticipatein andconsciouslyleadsocietytoward thesocialistdirection, and a wish for workers to foster and raise their acute and strong classconsciousness, than a call to degrade and downplay the role of the Party. With regardto the need for the working class to exercise leadership in everything, Maoemphasized, that the workers must improve themselves as well. He said in 1968: “Ourcountry has 7o0 million people, and the working class is the leading class. It isessential to bring into full play the leading role of the working class in the greatcultural revolution and in all fields of work. On its part, the working class shouldalways raise its political consciousness in the course of struggle.59 If the Communecould not replace theParty, then a natural solution woud be to put the Communeunder thedirect leadershipof theParty,whichcouldbecarried outintwoways.Onewas to re-introduce the “revolutionary” old Party cadres into the Commune, andanother was to have the non-communist-party-member delegates of the ShanghaiCommunejointheParty.Bothways,touseMao'sword,meanttotugunaxin(exhalethe old and inhale the new)for the purpose of reconstituting the Party committee inthe Commune.At the end of 1967, discussing the consolidation and re-building of the59The Manuscripts of Mao Zedong Since theFoundation of the PRC (Jianguo yilai Mao Zedong wengao).

462Party,Maoexpounded,

A human being has arteries and veins through which the heart makesthe blood circulate, and he breathes with his lungs,exhaling carbondioxide and inhaling fresh oxygen, that is, getting rid of the stale andtaking in the fresh. A proletarian party must also get rid of the stale andtake in the fresh,for only thus can it be full of vitality.Withouteliminating waste matter and absorbing fresh blood the Party has novigor.60

But when all local party branches are under fierce attack and “the class front isstill not clear” in a turbulent period of power seizure, there is no way to incorporateinto theParty thegenuine advanced elementsof theproletariatwhohavepassed thetests in great storms. The only viable way to form a nucleus of Party leadership, inaddition to the communist rebels, was to incorporate those old Party cadres whowerepushed aside by previous rebel struggles yet potentially sympathized or supported therebels. If a cadre successfully went through the procedure of liangxiang (which meanspublically showing their supportive attitude toward rebellion), he or she could beaccepted by the rebels and admitted into the new power organ. Once the ShanghaiCommune became subordinate to the leadership of the reconstructed CCP, and withthe institution of thee-in-one committees, the original vision of a Commune based onpopular general elections, was altered. Among the triple political forces, the old Partycadres would be recommended by the mass organizations below and then approved bythe Party at higher levels; the Army representatives could only be appointed by thearmed forces under the orders of higher commanders. Clearly, popular elections only60LinBiao,Rport to thinthNtionalCongress ofthCommuistParyfChinaApril99,inChPolitics,Documents and Analysis,Vol. 1, p.75,ed.by James T.

463took place among the mass organizations. Under such circumstances, it was actuallyimpossible to carry out a far-reaching and comprehensiveParis Commune styleelection in the whole Shanghai Commune. If the principle of the Paris Commune wasmainly understood as^the use of revolutionary violence toseize power, smash thestate machine of the bourgeoisie and practice the dictatorship of the proletariat,” thenthe title of Shanghai Commune certainly applies as it did in fact smash the local statemachine that had been“usurped by the capitalist roaders" (represented by the old SPC)and this seizure of power was carried out by rebels who proclaimed to uphold thedictatorship of the proletariat. But if the core Paris Commune principle is mainlyunderstood as instituting the “general elections", then the Shanghai Communediffered greatlyfrom theParis Commune.For various reasons,Maosuggested toZhangChunqiao andYaoWenyuan that itwas better to rename the new power organin Shanghai, because practice and content were more important than title and form.Maoexpoundedonthissaying

In regardto theform of sovietpolitical power,as soon as itmaterialized,Lenin was elated,deeming it a remarkable creation byworkers, peasants and soldiers, as well as a new form of proletariandictatorship.Nonetheless,Leninhadnotanticipatedthenthatalthoughthe workers, peasants and soldiers could use this form of politicalpower, it could also be used by the bourgeoisie, and by Khrushchev.Thus, the present soviet has been transformed from Lenin's soviet toKhrushchev's soviet. Britain is a monarchy. Doesn't it have a king?The U.S. has a presidential system. They are both the same, beingbourgeois dictatorships. The puppet regime of South Vietnam has apresident and bordering it is Shanouk's Royal Kingdom of Cambodia.Which is better?I am afraid Sihanouk is somewhat better.India has apresidential system; its neighbor, Nepal, is a kingdom. Which countryis better? It would seem that the kingdom is somewhat better than India.This is judging by their present performances. In the case of ancientChina's three kings and five emperors, they were called kings in the

464Chou dynasty, emperors in the Qin dynasty. The First Emperor of Qin(Qinshihuang) assumed all the titles of three kings and five emperors.It was called Heavenly King in the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, whileTang Taizong also called himself Heavenly Emperor. So you see, titleshave changed over and over again. What we want to see is not thechanging of titles, because the problem lies not with title, but withpractice; not with form, but with content. Titles must not be changedtoo frequently; we don't emphasize names, but emphasize practice; notform,butcontent.ThatfellowWangMangoftheHandynastywasaddicted to changing names. As soon as he became emperor, hechanged all the titles of government offices,likemany of us whohavea dislike for the title “chief."He also changed the names of allcountries in the country. This is like our Red Guards who have changedalmost all the street names of Peking, making it impossible for us toremember them.We still remember their former names.It becamedifficult for Wang Mang to issue edicts and orders, because the peopledid not know what changes had been made.This form of populardrama can be used either by China or by foreign countries, by theproletariat or by the bourgeoisie. The principal experiences are theParisCommuneandthesoviet.Wecanimaginethatthe[name]People's Republic of China can be used by both classes. If we shouldbe overthrown and the bourgeoisie came to power, they would have noneed to change the name, but would still call it the People's Republicof China. . . . The main thing is which class seizes political power. Thatis the fundamental question, not what its name is.

HereMao clearly pointed out that it does not matter what kind of title the newpolitical power bears,what really mattered is its nature,which is not determined by itstitle,but by the class thatseized it.Butif titles arenot soimportant,whydidMaosuggest a name change for the Shanghai Commune?As I have mentioned, Maocertainly liked the name“commune'very much.After Mao excitedly exclaimed thatthe “People's Commune is good,” in the movement of agriculture collectivization, allrural collectives under countylevelwerenamed as"so-and-soPeople's Communes"Also under Mao's influence, at the height of the Great Leap Forward, there were evenmany experimental "City People's Communes"in some big cities, such as Beijing and61MaoZedong,Talks atThreeMeetingsWithComradesChang Ch'un-ch’iaoAnd YaoWen-yuan,February1967,SelectedWorks of Mao Tse-tung:Vol. IX,published in India byKranti Publications,Secunderabad,andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.

465Harbin.Eventhoughthosecitycommunesweredisbandedbecausethiswaspremature,all therural communes intheCR continued and rapidly developedeconomically and politically.6² If the title of“people's communes"were acceptableeveninvillages—whichwererelatively more“backward"than cities—why not namethe new power organ in Shanghai a “commune"? Mao offered another reason for thenamechange,

I thinkwe should bemorestable andshould not change all thenames.This is because this would give rise to the question of changing thepolitical system, to the question of the state system, and to the questionof the name of the country. Would you want to change [the name] tothe Chinese People's commune! Should the Chairman of the People'sRepublic of China be called director or commune leader? Not only thisproblem, but another problem would arise. That is, if there is a change,it will be followed by the question of recognition or non-recognition byforeign countries.When the name of a country is changed, foreignambassadorswilllosetheircredentials,newambassadorswillbeexchanged and recognition will be given anew. I surmise that theSoviet Union would not extend recognition. This is because she wouldnot dare to recognize, since recognition might cause troubles for thesoviet.How could therebe a ChinesePeople's Commune?It would berather embarrassing to them, but the bourgeois nations might recognizeit.... The people of Shanghai like the people's commune very much,and like that name very much. What should we do? Shouldn't you goback and do some consultation? There are several methods that we canuse: one of them is to make no change, and go on calling it theShanghai People's Commune. The advantage of this method is that itcould safeguard the enthusiasm of Shanghai's people, since they likethis commune.The shortcoming of this is thatyourswould bethe onlyone in the entire country, and so won't you be rather isolated?For nowdon't announceinRenminribao[People'sDaily] thateveryonewantsto call it People's Commune. If the Central Committee shouldrecognizePeople's Commune andpublishit in theRenminribao,thenthe name will be used throughout the country. Why should only

Shanghai be allowed to call it so, and we cannot? This would make it62 Some scholarslike Joseph Liu argued that the rural peoples communes had been out-and-out failure since theirestablishment.SeeJosephLiu,ThePeople'sCommunes and theParisCommune,inStudiesinSovietThoughtVol12,No.2 (Jun.,1972),pp.149-165 Such a claim,Ibelieve,needed to be further justified.

466rather difficult. Thus, there are both advantages and shortcomings innot changing the name. The second method is to change it throughoutthe country. This would necessitate a change in the political system andin the country's name. Some people might not recognize it, and muchtrouble might ensue. Moreover, it wouldn't have any meaning, and nopractical significance. The third method is to go ahead and change it,thus conforming with the entire country. Of course, you could changeit in the near future or later on, not necessarily right now. But if youpeople still say that you don't wish to change, then you may just aswell call it this name for some time. What do you think? Does it makesense?63

In fact, many places applied to the Center for permission to establish people'scommunes modeled on the Shanghai Commune. If this trend persisted, the PRCwould logically have tobe renamed the ChinesePeople's Commune. In other words,maintaining the title of the Shanghai Commune would have involved complexquestions that involved changing the political system or even the state system. FonMao, that was really a big issue.Yet this could by no means be decided solely by therebels, who might not have been in a position of being the majority even after theJanuary Storm and the first wave of power seizures that surged across the country.This necessitated a great deal of struggles and negotiations with all kinds of politicalforces.Aswesawwithin theTantrum at theHuai RenHallincident onFebruary 11.before Mao's series of talks with Zhang and Yao, Marshal Ye purposely and angrilyput forward this big issue involving the state system to ChenBoda,the director ofCCRG and a Commune theoretician.Marshal Ye's attitude toward the ShanghaiCommune could have been conveyed to Mao through certain channels. In factMarshal Yewas represented thekind of disaffection and disapproval toward theShanghai Commune and the CR as a whole among high Party and army cadres. This63Ibid.

467was manifested strikingly and cruelly, in the February Countercurrent, in whichthousands upon thousands of rebels suffered arrests, beatings, injuries and killings bythe authorities and armed forces.As a master strategist who never fought a battlewithout preparation or without a good chance of winning, from the beginning of theCR Mao had to tackle and deal with emerging changes and rise to the challengespresented by different forces - especially the fierce oppositional attitudes from withinthe army, which was a force that had usually, in the past, been on his side in thecourse of the revolution. In this sense, I argue that Mao's suggestion of changing thename of the Shanghai Commune was also a strategically safe retreat.

Yet the most important reason for Mao's proposal to replace the ShanghaiCommune might lie in his direct comment on the Paris Commune. He said.

The Paris Commune, — did we not all say that to institute a ParisCommune is to institute a new political power? The Paris Communewas founded in 1871, almost 96 years ago. If the Paris Commune hadnot failed, but had been successful, then in my opinion, it would havebecome by now a bourgeois commune. This is because it wasimpossiblefor theFrench bourgeoisie to allowFrance's working classto have so much political power. That is the case of the ParisCommune.64

Clearly, for Mao, inherent shortcomings of the Paris Commune led to itsdownfall. With regard to the shortcomings of the Commune model, I think there werestill differences between the viewpoints of Mao and Marx. In his letter to Dr.Kugelmann concerning the Paris Commune (London, April 12, 1871), Marx pointedout that in this regard there were two great lessons that should be well taken,64Ibid.

468If they are defeated only their“good nature"will be to blame. Theyshould have marched at once on Versailles, after first Vinoy and thenthereactionarysection of theParisNational Guard had themselvesretreated.The right momentwasmissedbecause of conscientiousscruples. They did not want to start the civil war, as if that mischievousabortion Thiers had not already started the civil war with his attempt todisarm Paris. Second mistake: The Central Committee surrendered itspower too soon, to make way for the Commune.65

What is indicated here by Marx is that Paris Commune should have had astrong fist to hit and suppress counterrevolutionaries. In his talks with Zhang and YaoMao also expressed his view that the Shanghai Commune had been too soft withregard to suppressing counter-revolutionaries. He noted, “Someone complained to methat when people were apprehended by the bureau of public security, they would enterthrough the front door and be released through the back door." Yet for Mao, even ifthe Paris Commune had had harsher and stronger measures, say, acting upon Marx'ssuggestions, to advance toVersailles immediately, and confiscate the banks, it wouldstill have been a short-lived regime as it was impossible for "the French bourgeoisieto allow France's working class to have so much political power."Why was that? Inthe eyes of Mao, the Paris Commune was a premature political entity for the stillfledging proletariat. Indeed, even though several communes appeared in Marseilles.Saint Etienne, Lyon, among others, shortly before or responding to and resonatingwith theParis Commune,they werestill smallisolated islands in an ocean ofbourgeoisie, petti-bourgeoisie, and conservative peasantry - thanks to its ownhistorical limitations and the Bonaparte regime's political propaganda.Without thefull support of the predominant population of peasantry, the Paris Commune was65 Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, On the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971, p.284.

469doomed to fail.Even if theParis Commune had managed to survive in favorablenational circumstances, it had little chance of surviving international interventionsThe proletarian Paris commune would, sooner or later, inevitably become a bourgeoiscommune.

Leninofferedmoredetails on thereasonsfor thedefeatof theParisCommune:(1) (First of all)Deficiencies of organization; (2) Defensive attitude; (3)Thiers-Bismarck deal; (4) Lack of class consciousness (Proudhonists, Blanquists); (5)Infatuation with nationalistic and revolutionary talk; (6) did not “expropriate theexpropriators"and did not take over such institutions such as banks; (7) excessivemagnanimity toward the enemies.°6 Why didn't communards in Paris take necessarymeasures to put down enemies? For Lenin and Leon Trotsky, the most critical lessonof the Paris Commune was the lack of a firm organization, or more precisely, a partyWhen the enemies fled toVersaille,it was a great victory and the bourgeoisgovernment could have been crushed almost without the spilling of blood, but itturned out tobe the opposite. Leon Trotsky's view on this lay in the fact that, as he putit, “there was no organization of a centralized party, having a rounded view of thingsand special organs for realizing its decisions.*67 Marx contended that it was too soonfor the Central Committee to surrender its power, but Trotsky noticed that even theCentral Committee of the National Guard actually needed to be led. Trotsky argued

It was indispensable to have an organization incarnating the

political experience of the proletariat and always present—-not only in66 Lenin on the Paris Commune, Moscow: Progress publishers, 1970.p. 8, p.12. p.21.67Leon Trotsky on the Paris Commune,p.54,Pathfinder Press,1970.

470theCentralCommittee,butin thelegions,inthebattalion,in thedeepest sectors of the French proletariat....

Electibility,thedemocraticmethod,isbutoneoftheinstrumentsin the hands of the proletariat and its party. Electibility can in no wisebe a fetish, a remedy for all evils. The methods of electibility must becombined with those of appointments. The power of the Communecame from the elected National Guard. But once created, theCommune should have reorganized with a strong hand the NationalGuard, from top to bottom, given it reliable leaders and established arégime of very strict discipline. The Commune did not do this, beingitself deprivedof apowerfulrevolutionarydirectingcenter.It toowascrushed.

We can thus thumb the whole history of the Commune, page bypage, and we will find in it one single lesson: a strong party leadershipisneeded.68

With regard to the counterpart of the Paris Commune in Shanghai, Maoseemed tohold similar views to Lenin and Trotsky's comments on theParisCommune. Firstly, even though there were several hundred mass organizations inShanghai, it was very hard for them to unite and fight their common enemies; toomany non-cooperative, even infighting organizations could also be seen as a kind ofdeficiency of an organization. Secondly, with regard to suppressing the so-calledcounter-revolutionaries, the Shanghai Commune displayed a relatively soft andsometimes defensive attitude. Thirdly, the split of the Shanghai workers’ movementwas a telling manifestation of the immaturity of class consciousness among theChinese workers. Under such circumstances, Mao tended to believe that it was farfrom the right time to institute a Paris Commune style popular power organ inShanghai, based on universal suffrage without strong party leadership. While the ParisCommune abolished the standing army, Mao called for the intervention of the68 Ibid,p.54, p.61.

471standingarmytosupportthe“broadmassesoftheLeft."Thisactionmadetheestablishement of a Paris Commune prototype in Shanghai impossible.For theShanghai Commune, Mao brought forward his own solution:

I think we had better not change the name, and not call it commune. Itwouldbebettertoobservetheoldmethod.WestillshouldhavethePeople's Congress and elect people's councils in the future.Anychange in name is a change in form, and does not solve the problem ofcontent. When we set up temporary power structures, do we not stillcall them Revoluitonary Committees? The controlling organs inschools can become cultural Revolutionary Ccommittees or culturalrevolutionary leading teams. The Sixteen Articles specify this.69

In fact, Mao was not the only person who seriously pondered whether theCommune model in its prototype shape was a proper form of a new power organ atthe time. Within the so called “proletarian headquarters" in Beijing, Premier ZhouEnlai, a supporter of mass rebellion at least in the early years of the CR, was a staunchopponent of the nascent commune movement.As early as in late January, Zhou Enlaitried to cool the fervor of the potential commune-builders by offering his reasoningfor not employing a Paris Commune style general election at the time.At a meetingwith rebel representatives on January 26,1967,Zhou posited that the electionpreconditioned the“integration of therevolutionary organizations with themassesofthe people": the gradual education and transformation of rightist elements, theisolation of ultra-leftists, and ultimately the“uniting with 95 per cent, of the massesand 95 per cent, of the cadres." That is to say, only after the battle of the CR wasdecisively won by the Leftists, could the general election be implemented. Zhou69 MaoZedong,Talks at Three Meetings with Comrades Chang Ch'un-ch'iao and YaoWen-yuan, February 1967,Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung:Vol. IX, published in India by Kranti Publications,Secunderabad, andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009.

472hence reminded the audience that,“We are far from having reached that stage at thispoint.*70 According to the sinologist John B. Starr, it was impossible for the ParisCommune to be realized in its original shape in the wake of the January Storm. Hecommented:

There was, to begin with, a great deal of truth in Zhou Enlai'scommentsontheCommuneelectionsystemlateinJanuary.Theoperation of the Paris Commune - fitful and inefficient as it mayactually have been, Marx's description notwithstanding - did depend onthe fact that the principal enemies of the Communards were located inVersailles, not in Paris. This balance and placement of forces wasclearly not duplicated in China's urban areas in the early months of1967 - months when the Maoist press itself began to speak for the firsttime of the forces of the Left as a minority. Once the Commune'selection system was seen as inappropriate, the model had, in effect,been emasculated so far as its applicability to the reorganization ofChineselocal politics in the wake of themovement to seize power wasconcerned.71

The refusalto institutethe Paris Commune power organinitsprototypeshape—especially the general election—was at the time not only shared by themajority of high Party and army leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and YeJianying, among others, but also taken for granted by some local rebel leaders, eventhough they valued and did practice many aspects of the principles of the ParisCommune. For example, on January 28, the new municipal RC in Taiyuan, ShanxiProvince passed a declaration, which predicted that, "We firmly believe that in the nottoo distant future,a completely new form of political organization,based on our70ZhouEnlai tan duoquan wenti(Zhou Enlai onthe Question of PowerSeizure"),in Hongse zhanbao,17February1967.Englishtranslation here isfromJohnBryanStarr,Revolution inRetrospect:TheParis Communethrough Chinese Eye,in The China Quarterly,No.49.(Jan.-Mar,1972),p.119.71JohnryanStarr,RevolutioninRetrospect:TheParisCommune throughChineseEye,inChinaQuarterly,No.49.(Jan.-Mar,1972),p.124

473richlydevelopedexperienceof theParisCommuneandmoreinkeepingwiththesocialist economic base, namely, the Taiyuan Commune, will appear." Yet severaldays later, the rebel-controlled Shanxi Daily issued an editorial on February 2, 1967.which said, “We have proclaimed the Paris Commune election methods. However,only with the revolutionary factions in a superior position, with the handful of those inauthority taking the capitalist road completely overthrown, knocked down, anddiscredited, and only when the conservative forces have been completely wiped outcan there be a general election to elect a leadership of the left."72 Similarly, on Feb.12, the 31 Corps of Jinggangshan Regiment in Qinghua University took the view thatthe Paris Commune-type new power organ should not be established at the time, andthat in keeping with the editorial in the third issue of Red Flag in 1967,it wasneccessay to form a provinsional power organ based on a triple combination.Evidently, at this stage, many supporters of the CR, as well as many opponents of theCR, did not wish to run a Paris Commune style general election. This was possiblyduetothefactthatbothrebelsandconservativesfeltthattheoutcomeofageneralelectionwasunpredictable

OnJanuary28,1967,31rebelorganizationsofHeilongjiangprovinceparticipated in a joint meeting to discuss the issue of forming a new power organ inthat province. A hot debate raged revolving around two topics: first, was it the righttimetoseizepowerfrom the old provincial party committee?Second,the72 John Bryan Starr, “Revolution in Retrospect: The Paris Commune through Chinese Eye", in The ChinaQuarterly,No.49.(Jan.-Mar,1972),pp.118-119.Qiu, xinwei and Yuan Shuyu ed., Qinghua wenge qingli: shiliao shilu dashi rizhi (Experiencing the Qinghua'sCultural Revolution: Collected Historical Materials and Chronology of Major Events). Hong Kong: Xianggangwuqixueshechubanshe,2009.

474organizational form of power seizure, or precisely speaking, what kind of form wouldthe new power organ adopt?With regard to the second question, some factions.represented by Huang Kecheng,the Red Guard leader of the Rebel Regiment ofHarbin Military Engineering Institute (Hajungong zaofan tuan), insisted using theexperiences of Shanghai to form a Heilongjiang Commune. As we know, Shanghaiwas busy preparing for the establishment of the Shanghai Commune at that time. FanZhengmei was a Red Guard leader at Harbin Normal Institute and the would-bedirector of the Heilongjiang Red Rebels' RC - which shaped up on January 31, 1967.Ren Wanxin was a young politics teacher at the same Institute. In accordance withwhat Fan Zhengmei and Ren Wanxin discussed earlier, Fan argued at the preparatorymeeting that the proposed Heilongjiang new power organ should not be named aftertheParis Commune.He argued,

I disagree with setting up a Paris Commune type new power organimmediately, and I disagree with naming it after the Paris Commune.The reason is very simple, because it is not the right time andconditions are not yet ripe. I propose to name the new organ “RedRebels' RC", which will take charge of the Party, governmental,financial and cultural power of the whole province. This will be atransitional organ, and in the future we will form a new power organthroughdirectgeneralelections.This“Red RebelsRC"consists ofrepresentatives from three sections: the Army, the cadres and the massorganizations. The leading nexus, in the name of “Service Team"(qingwuzu), is made up of the leaders of the provincial military districtand the PLA units stationed locally, the representatives ofrevolutionary cadres, and the responsible persons of the UnitedHeadquarters. We shouldlearn from Shanghai, mainly about theirrevolutionary spirit, proletarian stance, viewpoints, and workingmethods, but not what they have specifically done. We should proceedfrom local reality, carrying forward the spirit of daring to think, daringto do, and daring to be pathbreaker, and try to discover, invent, makecreations,andadvance.Ithinkthattheformof"RedRebelsRC"isinaccordancewiththegistof TheSixteen-pointProgram,whichstatesthat“Many new things have begun to emerge in the great proletarian

475cultural revolution. The cultural revolutionary groups, committees andother organizational forms created by the masses in many schools andunits are something new and of great historic importance." Triplecombination is a new thing arisingfrom theSocialistEducationMovement in the Twenty-three Articles.The three-in-one combinationis a transitional and temporary power organ established in places wherepower must be seized and it has revolutionary authority. We run a triplecombination of the Army, cadres and masses.With the support of thearmed forces, the responsible persons of United Headquarters of RedRebels'Regiment, together with the responsible persons of theprovincial military district and the PLA units stationed in the locality,and the representatives of revolutionary cadres in the HeilongjiangParty Committee and theHeilongjiangPeople's Committee,jointlyseized power.Thisis a development of theTwenty-threeArticles and afruit of learning from the experiences of places such as Shanxi andGuizhou, where the armed forces participated in power seizure.74

The main reason for not adopting the communal form, according to FanZhenmei and his supporters,was that the timing and conditions were not mature.Although in his memoir, Fan did not offer more details about it, one thing is clear. Toinstitute a Paris Commune general election, the rebels in Heilongjiang, or in otherplaces,would not allow conservativemasses and mostoldPartycadres torunforoffice or to be elected, thus excluding at least half of the Chinese population. A“general election" without the participation of a good many people would seriouslyundermine the new power organs' authority and legitimacy. What's more, even if thepower had already been seized at the provincial level, power organs at various levelsunder the province were still in the process of fierce contention and struggles.Whenthere were still scorching battles everywhere at the grass-root units, how could anelectionbe“general"?Nevertheless,thetitleoftheParisCommunewassodeartosomerebels in thecityof Harbin,thecapital cityof HeilongjiangProvince,that theyinsisted on naming the new power organ of Harbin city as^HarbinPeople's74FanZhengmei, A Memoir out ofAnAutumn Dream Qu meng zhuisi), Beijing: Gaodeng jiaoyu chubanshe,2007.Vol.1,p.161.

476Commune."HuangKecheng,theRed Guardleader of theRebelRegiment of HarbinMilitary Engineering Institute and later the director of the “Harbin People'sCommune", was one of the strong advocators of naming new power organs after theParis Commune. Out of disagreement, Fan Zhenmei, who persisted in his view thatthe name of "RC" was better than “commune” at the given historical moment, refusedto attend the inauguration of the “Harbin People's Commune". But this did not at allmean that Fan Zhengmei and his colleagues in the new power organ opposed theprinciples of the Paris Commune. Fan Zhengmei recollected,

... We rebels stressed most on the general election and the operation ofthis principle both at the top and down below, [while the revolutionaryold Party and army cadres] Pan Fusheng and Wang Jiadao stressedmost on the free supply system (gongji zhi). They thought that the freesupplysystemwas thebestwaytopreventthenewbourgeoisiefromemerging. Therefore, they talked in high spirits with us about variousstories of the free supply system [during wartime and at the beginningstage of thePRC]. I clearly remember their excitement and happinesswhen reiterating these stories, as if they had returned to that excitingtime.Nevertheless,all of us [in theleadership of newpower organ]had a strong consensus that the old choose-and-appoint system was notscientific, and it was necessary to institute the general election of theParis Commune. The Party system and state power had to truly besubjected to the direct supervision of the masses. The best way forleaders to be supervised was the sida("Four Big Rights"): to speak outfreely, air views freely, hold great debates, and write big-characterposters. All functionaries had to be at the service of the people,not themasters ofthepeople.Nomatterhowhigh orlowinpositions,everyofficial could work both at the top and down below. Life tenure[ofleading posts] and special privileges would not be allowed.75

At the beginning of February 1967, led by Fan Zhengmei, the HeilongjiangRedRebel RC summarizedfourexperiences ofpower seizures and published an75 Ibid. Vol.1, pp.181-182.

Many people hence claimed that Mao retracted his promise to establish a“Chinese Paris Commune”modeled on the Paris Commune.Some politicalformations even denounced Mao as a^traitor”to the interests of the working classsince Mao more favored a revolutionary Committee than the Commune. But whatneeds to be clarified is: when and where did Mao say that theParis Commune modelas such, that is, the exact shape of the prototype, should be institutionalized in Chinawithout modifications during the CR? It is true that Mao mentioned a “Chinese ParisCommune". But he never hinted that this “Chinese Paris Commune” should mimic allthe aspects of the original Paris Commune.For Mao,what one should learn from theParis Commune was mainly its principles and spirit, but not emulate every singlespecific action of the Paris Commune. Therefore, it is more reasonable to say that theParisCommuneshouldbeconsideredasestablishingaprecedentintermsoftheCCPDocuments of the GreatProletarian CulturalRevolution,1966-1967,p.326,Union Research Institute,HongKong,1968.According to someRed Guard publications,while talking withZhang Chunqiao andYaoWenyuanbefore February18,Mao mentioned that the Central Committee had ordered that apart from Shanghai, other placescould not formPeoples'Commune.If this was true,then even before talking to Zhang and Yao,the CentralCommittee had already reached some consensus for not instituting people's communes in the country.On theRevolutionaryThree-in-OneCombination(Lun geming de sanjiehe),inHongqio.5,1967,translatedinPekingReview,No.12,March17,1967.

479smashing of the old bourgeois state machinery by proletarian power. Mao never statedthat amid the storm of the CR, all the officials, the standing army, and the policeshould be totally abolished - like what happened in the Paris Commune. If Maohimself never proposed that a Paris Commune regime should necessarily be the exactprototype of the Shanghai Commune, then, why is it legitimate to conclude that Maoabandoned the model of the Paris Commune?Moreover, after the Shanghai Communewas renamed the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, it underwent majororganizational changes compared to the pre-CR Shanghai power organs.Thosechanges were, it seems, partly inspired by the principles of the Paris Commune.

Nominal Shift: The Staging of the Shanghai Revolutionary

Committee

In the middle of February, while Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan facedtremendous opposition to the Shanghai Commune from topParty and army cadres inBeijing, some good news came to them from Shanghai. There were some signs thatthe solidarity of the anti-Shanghai Commune forces seemed less stable than before.Geng Jinzhang's own propaganda team was said to be demanding that he “examinecertain faults in his orientation". And Geng's ally Chen Hongkang, the head of theWorkers Third Headquarters, was also said to be “deposed and downgraded" by hislieutenants.They thenproposedtoreconcilewith theWGHbutwererebuffed.TheWGH figured out that Chen was still in power and demanded that he step down

480completely. As a result, Chen Hongkang's Workers Third Headquarters launchedlightning yet concerted assaults on many district branches of the WGH throughoutShanghai. During these attacks, Chen was said to issue orders to “close down allliaison centers of groups from outside Shanghai and impound all Rebel propagandavans,” since those liaison centers were mostly in support of the Shanghai Commune.Chen claimed, “The name of Zhang Chunqiao is by no means synonymous with theCCRG. This is no time to be superstitious about one individual."80Imaginably,theoffensive of the Workers Third Headquarters was beaten back by an equallybelligerent WGH. On February 17, to deal a severe blow to the anti-Commune forces,for the first time since the establishment of the Shanghai Commune, the People'sDaily released an New China News Agency's report of Shanghai's CR titled “TheAll-city Provisional Supreme Power Organ of Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels CallsAll Revolutionary Rebel Fighters and Revolutionary Masses to Seriously Study andApply Mao Zedong Works in a Creative Way, and Cater to the New Circumstances ofthe Struggle to Seize Power". By covering the news about the “All-city ProvisionalSupreme Power Organ of Shanghai Revolutionary Rebels"” instead of the “ShanghaiCommune” as its official name, this report apparently implied that the Center inBeijing had acknowledged the legitimacy and authority of the Shanghai Commune,but was just not in favor of the Commune's title. Even if not naming specific factionsthis report decidedly condemned the Geng Jinzhang-led forces,

Get rid of all these non-proletarian thoughts amongcurrent revolutionary rebels such as small-groupism, anarchism,parochialism, sectarianism, unionism, disregard for organizationaldiscipline, ultra-democracy, mountaintopism, and individualism!..81

But the Geng Jinzhang-led Second Corps remained on the same track ofopposing the WGH. On February 20, the Second Corps convened a closed meetinglimited to the members of the Second Corps at Friendship Theater. The standingmember of the Second Corps Lu Jiabing claimed at the meeting that debts of bloodhad to be paid in blood and the Second Corps must fight back in response to theWGH's offensive. Lu Jiabing also stressed that they should not conduct organizationalunification toohastily,and thatthepower they currentlywieldedshould notbeeasilyhanded over. Another standing member, Fang Zhihua laid out steps for the next stage:8TheAlcityProvisionalupremePowerOrganfShanghaiRevolutionarRebelsCallsAllRevoluionaryRebelFighters andRevolutionaryMasses onSeriouslyStudying andApplyingMaoZedongWorksinaCreativeWay,andCateringto theNewCircumstancesof theStruggleofPowerSeizure(Shanghaigemingzaofanpaiquanshi linshizuigaoquanli jigouhaozhaoquanti gemingzaofanpaizhanshihegemingqunzhongrenzhenhuoxuehuoyong Maozhuxi zhuzuo,shiying duoquan douzheng xin xingshi),inPeople'Daily,February17,1967.Mytranslation.

Unite with other organizations and concentrateforces to deal the opponent a crushing blow. At the meeting, Geng Jinzhangencouraged all the members of the Second Corps to hold on steadfastly to the end.82Yet at this moment, the unity of the anti-WGH and the Shanghai Communedeteriorated. Geng Jinzhang arrested some defectors for their betrayal. Meanwhileafter fabricating a document saying that Premier Zhou supported them,one of Geng'sstrongest allies, the Red Guard Army, which consisted of transferredveterans,incurably and unquestionably came to a dead end. At the time, Geng Jiangzhangcalled for a series of meetings of all of his men to urge a full-scale attack on the WGH,the pillar of the Shanghai Commune. Geng's proposal, this time, did not get approvalfrom most of his men. Under such circumstance, Geng still declared,“I am in theright and I'm going to stick it out! Even if everyone deserts me, I won't be scaredoff!"At last, the anti-Communefactions, agreed tohold a mass demonstration inPeople's Plaza on February 22. This turned out to be the last such massiveanti-Shanghai Commune rally. Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan returned fromBeijing the next day. And after this GengJinzhang was never favorably mentioned inRed Guard publications and was always referred to as “the man who tried to wrecktheShanghai Commune.83

After “several months of uncertainty and reams of exaggerated, contradictory,82 See Ruci"heihui": beishang fanhu di'erbingtuan yici heihui jiyao(What a“BlackMeeting":The Summary of aBlackMeetingofTheSecondCorps ofShanghaiWorkersReturnedFrom theNorth),in CollectedLeaflets(chuandanhuibian,ed.bythePropagandaTeam of theWGH),No.3,Feb.28,1967.。Neale Hunter,1969,pp.253-259.

483and stereotype descriptions of plots and counterplots, sieges, and skirmishes",84 in thesnowy afternoon of February 24, a huge oath-taking rally with more than ten thousandpeople, titled “Raise the Great Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought and Take FurtherSteps to Seize Power in the Three-in-One Combination', was held at Cultural Plaza ofShanghai. Presided over by Yao Wenyuan and televised all over the city, this rally setas one of its main tasks explaining to the Shanghai rebels the reasons for the namechange of the Shanghai Commune. With a good sense of confidence and humor, andusing his capacity to explain profound things in simple terms, Zhang Chunqiacdynanmically communicated Mao's instructions about the CR in Shanghai to theenthusiastic audience. While detailing Mao's recent directives, Zhang succintlysummed up the main gist of Mao's talks: why it was necessary to make the CR underthe proletarian dictatorship; that carrying out the CR necessitated a great alliance; andthat the best way to reach a great alliance was through the three-in-one combinationTo win over the audience, Zhang mentioned that there were many failed cases ofpower seizures due to factional fights and the lack of a great alliance. For instance, aunit was said to have seized power, but seized only one print shop. Yet they refused tolet other units to print things there. This kind of power seizure, Zhang commented,was a take-over based on small-groupism. This in fact converted the ownership by thewhole people into the ownership by a small group and thus wrecked the building ofsocialism. This is the kind of thing, Zhang siad, that was advocated by theYugoslavian revisionist regime. Zhang stressed that the so-called workers? control in84Ibid.p.260.

484Yugoslavia and small-groupism were in essence capitalist ownership. For Zhang, thetriple combination was not only a way to help young rebels to learn from therevolutionary oldcadres,but also an effectivewaytofoster revolutionarysuccessors.And only with the triple combination could Shanghai's power be transferred in a safeand sound way, and be further strengthened and enhanced. Zhang then explainedMao's idea of why it was better in changing the name of the provisional power organof Shanghai. According to Mao, it was too early to institute a Shanghai Communemainly because Shanghai was far more advanced with the CR than other places in thecountry, and if the Center openly approved the Shanghai Commune, other citieswould definitely follow. Yet “this could short-circuit the movement by clamping apremature formula on a process that should reach its own conclusion through free andopen debate between divergent opinions.*85

At this rally, Zhang also refuted some wrong views, one of which was theabovementioned"February8circular order"that demanded theCenterget ridof alldirectors. It was by no means impermissible to make such a suggestion to the CenterZhang posited,yet it was not suitable for this faction to cable the Center with acircularwhich amounted toanultimatum.Moreover,abolishing allformaltitlesfor“zhang”(directors) was just a formal change, Zhang maintained, when what reallymattered was the essence. Take the title “secretary"(shuji) for example. In the time ofthe Nationalist regime, this was just the lowest rank for an official, but in theCommunist government, it became the title of the biggest power holder. Zhang85Here Iquote from Neale HunterShanghai Journal,p.261.But I have only been able to find such viewpoints ofMao about the Shanghai Commune in this English source. This is yet to be verified according to possible originalChinesesources.

485exposed the reactionary nature of the argument made by this faction that all thepeoplewith the titles of “zhang”(directors) were riding the Party and people's necks.Forexample, the dismissed defense minister Peng Dehuai was a defense minister, and LinBiao was a defense minister, too. One could say that Peng Dehuai rode the Party andpeople's necks, but one could not say that comrade Lin Biao was riding the Party andpeople's necks. Zhang Chunqiao hypothesized that these two ministers belonged totwo different classes. Without class analysis, there was no way in reality to practicethe three-in-one combination. In refuting some people's opposition to the slogan of"all power to the Shanghai People's Commune” and these opponents' claim that theCommune was merely set up by “a handful of people", Zhang emphasized that thepolitical foundation of the Shanghai Commune was firmly based on the JanuaryRevolution, a great revolution in which one class overthrew another and involvedmany Shanghai rebels. Seeing the power seizure from beginning to end, the Center,especially Chairman Mao himself, approved “A Letter to the People of the WholeCity" and the “Urgent Notice" issued by the Shanghai rebels. After this, the CentralCommittee, the State Council, the Military Committee, and the CCRG jointly sent acongratulatory telegram“Message of Greetings to Revolutionary Rebel Organizationsin Shanghai''. How could one say that the Shanghai Commune was set up by only ahandful of people when it had so profound mass support? In regard to someindividuals’ accusation that Zhang singlehandedly set up the Shanghai Commune.Zhang first humorously expressed his thanks to them and then said that he did nothave such magic powers. As for those who were driven by personal ambition, and

486thosewithasmall-groupistmentality,Zhangclarifiedthatthenewpower organwouldnot share the power with them, as they were actually the enemies of the proletariat.86

The Shanghai People's Commune, therefore, was renamed the Shanghai RCThe plaque of the Shanghai Commune was sent to a museum and a new plaque with"Shanghai RC" was put up at the Waitan office building. Some scholars, such asRaymond Lotta, held that the Shanghai Commune was “disbanded",87 which, I

，believe, is inaccurate because the ensuing Shanghai RC consisted of the original teamof the Shanghai Commune and stipulated that “All the manifestos, circular orders,announcements,decisions, resolutions and other documents issued by the formerShanghai People's Commune will continue to be valid. All Shanghai citizens shouldobserve and carry out in earnest. *88 (Of course, the Shanghai RC changed a lot in thesubsequentyears oftheCR.)

In some sense, the newly-formed Shanghai RC observed the principles of theParis Commune. In order to better understand the features of the Shanghai RC, allowme to first spell out more about what characterized thr Heilongjiang Red Rebel RC asMao called on the Shanghai rebles to learn from the Heilongjiang Red Rebel RC.8986See Zhang Chunqiao and YaoWenyuan'sSpeeches at the Oath-taking Rally to“Raisethe Great RedFlag ofMaoZedongThoughtandTakeFurtherStepstoSeizePowerintheThree-in-OneCombination"(ZhangChunqiaoYaoWenyuanzaigaojuMaoZedongsixiangweidahongqijinyibuzhankaisanjieheduoquan shishidahuishangdejianghua),Feb.24,1967,inSpeechesof theCentralLeaders(Zhongyang shouzhangjianghua),Vol.2,ed.by theRed Guard Liaison Post of the GeneralBeijing Glass Factory,Beijing,March,1967.8AlainBadiou's"Politics of Emancipation":A CommunismLocked Within the Confines of theBourgeoisWorldby Raymond Lotta,Nayi Duniya, and K.J.A.,fromhttp://www.demarcations-journal.org/issue01/demarcations_badiou.html,citedonOctober8,2009.88Shanghaishigemingweiyuanhui guanyu Shanghairenmin gongshelingshiweiyuanhui gaicheng Shanghai shigemingweiyuanhuidejueding(Resolutionof theShanghaiRevolutionaryCommitteeConcerningtheChangeoftheTemporaryCommitteeoftheShanghaiPeople'sCommuneintotheShanghaiRevolutionaryCommittee),February 23,1967,from Zhibu shenghuo (Life in Party Branches), No.9,March 6,1967,Shanghai.p.51.89SeeShanghaigemingzaofanpaiquanshilinshi zuigaoquanlijigou haozhaoquantigemingzaofanpai zhanshihegemingqunzhongrenzhenhuoxuehuoyongMaozhuxizhuzuo,shiyingdouquandouzhengxinxingshi(TheAll-cityProvisional SupremePowerOrganofShanghaiRevolutionaryRebels CallsAllRevolutionaryRebelFightersandRevolutionaryMassesonSeriouslyStudyingandApplyingMaoZedongWorksinaCreativeWay,andCateringtotheNewCircumstancesoftheStruggleofPowerSeizure),inPeople'sDaily,February17,1967.

487At the beginning of January 1967, Fan Zhengmei, the director of the HeilongjiangRed Rebel RC,presided over anenlarged meeting of aservice team and drafted TheNo.2Announcement ofHeilongjiangRed Rebel RC[penned byRenWanxinet al.],which clearly stated the doctrines, organizational form and cadre policies of the newpower organ.The doctrines were,

1.The construction of the RC must follow Chairman Mao'sessential thinking of maintaining the color of our country. Based on theexperiences of theParis Commune and theSovietUnion,the RCshould be a more advanced, new power organ which can help toacceleratethetransitiontocommunism.Therefore,itisnecessarytofully trust the masses, depend on the masses, and respect the initiativesof the masses, and to greatly carry out destruction as well construction.Never allow any patch-up reformism rooted in the old power organ.2. The RC must strengthen the [state] machine of dictatorship.Historicallessonsfromtheinternationalcommunistmovementtellusthat after the proletarian power seizure, should people forget classstruggle, proletarian dictatorship, and the sharp and complicatedstruggle of power seizure during the socialist period, the state powerwill be covertly taken over by class enemies, the heads of hundreds ofthousands people will be chopped off, and capitalism will be restored.3. The RC must be sharp, nimble, frugal, and pragmatic. And itshall be based on five (wu ge zui) principles: most be close to thebasic-level units (jiceng),most be close to the masses, must have amost revolutionary rebel spirit, must be most efficient in handlingaffairs,and must be most capable of serving the people. Therefore,it isnecessary to destroy the old bureaucratic establishments which areredundant, overstaffed, fighting among each other over trivial things.notcapable of handling affairsyet incubatingbourgeois nobles andlords.4. The RC must carry out the policy of the “three-in-one"combinations.5.All thestaffpersonswill havenoofficialtitles and extrawelfaretreatments. If conditions are ripe and the Central Committee ratifies it,theRCwill abolish the high salary system and carry out the communist

488style of a free supply system (gongji zhi) plus allowance. The RC willuncompromisinglysmash allconditions andfoundationsthatwouldbecome soil for the growth of a new bourgeoisie and privileged classAll the staff persons need to be elected through Paris Commune styleelections based on an extensive democracy. Those welcomed by themasses can be re-elected whereas those unqualified can be recalled anytime. Every staff person is required to be able to work both at the topand downbelow.TheRC shall bebuilt into abigschool of MaoZedongThought.9o

According to Fan Zhengmei's memoir, these five articles embodied their trendof thought and political ideals, and expressed the social vox populi and ideal goalsthatthemassespursuedwiththeirwholeheartsatthattime.Fanindicatedthatthesefive points are mainly based on two passages from Engels’“The 1891 Introduction toThe Civil War in France’". Fan purposely asked his comrades in the draft team led byRen Wanxin to put Engels'words there as the guideline of writing. Engels wrote:

Againstthistransformationofthestate and theorgansof thestatefrom servants of society into masters of society - an inevitabletransformation in all previous states -the Commune made use of twoinfallible expedients.In this first place, it filled all posts -administrative, judicial, and educational -by election on the basis ofuniversal suffrage of allconcerned,with the right of the same electorsto recall their delegate at any time. And in the second place, allofficials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by otherworkers. The highest salary paid by the Commune to anyone was6,000 francs. In this way an effective barrier to place-hunting andcareerism was set up, even apart from the binding mandates todelegates to representative bodies which were also added in profusion.

...Andfrom thisfollows a superstitiousreverencefor thestate andeverything connectedwithit,which takes rootsthemore readily aspeoplefrom their childhood are accustomed to imagine that the affairsandinterestscommontothewholeofsocietycouldnotbelooked afterotherwisethan astheyhavebeenlooked afterin thepast,thatis,through the state and its well-paid officials. And people think they havetaken quite an extraordinary bold step forward when they have rid

themselves of belief in a hereditary monarchy and swear by the90Fan Zhengmei,A Memoir out ofAn Autumn Dream(Qiu meng zhuisi),Beijing: Gaodeng jiaoyu chubanshe,2007. Vol.1, pp.180-181.

489democratic republic. In reality, however, the state is nothing but amachine for the oppression of one class by another, and indeed in thedemocratic republic noless than in the monarchy.91

As for the organizational structure of the Heilongjiang Red Rebel RC, theannouncement stipulated that the new power organ consisted of 17 committeemembers, including one director (banzhang) and one deputy director, thus reducingthetotal amountofthestafftoonefourthoftheformerofficialsintheoldpowerorgan.Among all committee members, five core members were elected to bemembersofaserviceteam,whosetaskwastoofferadvice andsuggestionsonmajorissues to the RC for discussion. The RC only had four subunits: one politicalcommittee, one production committee, one mass work committee, and one office, andeach ofthemhad severalfunctiongroups

It is difficult to figure out who is influencing who in a seething yet turbulentperiod of power seizure.There were quite a fewstriking similarities between theHeilongjiang Red Rebel RC and the Shanghai RC. Both of them, for exampleconverted departments into teams in order to streamline personnel, and stressed thetriple alliance, strengthening the proletarian dictatorship, and suppressingcounter-revolutionaries. There were difference between the Shanghai Commune andthe Shanghai RC which followed it. A major difference lay with the Shanghai RC wasthe broadening of its foundation of governance, especially in that it incorporatedmany old Party cadres who had supposedly rectified their errors and returned toMao's line. This, of course, reaffirmed the Party leadership. And the Shanghai RC91 Engels,Postscript of 1891 Introduction to the Civil War in France,http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/postscript.htm,citedonOctober15,2009

490alsoeventuallyadmittednot afewanti-Communerebels,andevenpreviouslyloyalistrepresentatives into the revamped power organ. Moreover, the Shanghai RCdifferentiated itself from the old Shanghai power organ in that it united the Party andthe government into one single administrative structure. As the old SPC and the oldShanghai People's Committee were combined into one unified structure under theframework of the Shanghai RC, there was a lot of overlapping and overstaffed officeswhichwere eliminated or streamlined.Another major difference between theShanghai Commune and the Shanghai RC was that the Shanghai RC suspended thegeneral election that had been vaguely promised by the Shanghai Commune. UndertheframeworkoftheRCtherewerestill,nevertheless,extensivedemocraticelectionsheld in later congresses of the Red Guards, workers, peasants, employees, amongother similar establishments.Yet theMaoist leadership posited that all theRCs werejust transitional. The next political arrangement in the future could be a Communestatebasedonageneralelection

As illustrated above, the Shanghai RC neither represented a disruption nor adiscontinuation of the Shanghai Commune. The Shanghai RC, instead, maintainedcorefeatures of a Commune style power organ.For instance,it legalized andinstituted the mass movement. In March 1967, in order to manage the city effectivelysome people in the Shanghai RC proposed to adjust the original teams from theShanghai Commune. The original plan was to set up 12 teams and one office, namely,the Shanghai RC office; the Economic Team; the Industry Team; the Village WorkTeam; the Financial and Trade Team; the Culture, Education and Health Team; the

491RegionalWork Team; thePolitical and Law Team; the Science and Technology Team:the Foreign Affairs Team; and the Labor Wages Team.Former teams in the ShanghaiCommune such as the Liaison Team, Investigation Team, Political Propaganda Teamand Reception Team were listed to be cancelled. In addition, the former GraspRevolution andPromoteProductionTeamin the Commune,as a contingencypowerorgan, was replaced by corresponding teams. Obviously, as all these to-be-cancelledteams were related to the mass movements,this plan would inevitably weaken themass movement and strengthen the administrative functions of the Shanghai RC. Butwhen this new plan was laid out, fierce and overwhelming objections were voicedfrom the rebel representatives in the Shanghai RC. As a compromise, the LiaisonTeam and Reception Team in the Commune were incorporated into a new "MassMovement Team'and thePolitical Propaganda Team remained untouched as therebelshad insisted.Rebel leaders were appointed tobe thehead of all theteams,yetthe operation of those teams wereput on the shoulders of the common middle-lowerranking cadres who had rebelled against the old SPC and were experienced inadministering the city." With all the people's efforts, Shanghai's underminedeconomy picked up very quickly.In the year of 1968,theindustrial development ofShanghaiexceededthatof1966

In addition, looking at the original structure of the Shanghai Commune, theShanghai RC planned to put the role and function of the rebel forces at the forefrontThey assigned a quota for the mass organizations, insuring that the rebels would be a92Li Xun,The Leadership and Administrative Set-up of the Shanghai People's Commune and the ShanghaiRevolutionaryCommittee(ShanghairenmingongsheheShanghaishigemingweiyuanhui lingdaochengyuan heban'gong jigou shezhi), in electronic magazine “Memory”(jiyi), No.9, March 30, 2009.

492dominant force in the new power organ. The rebel intellectual representative ZhuYongjia recollected, “Initially, the Shanghai RC was planned to be made up of 155committee members,within which the responsible persons of mass organizations,including representatives of [rebel] workers, peasants, students and governmentfunctionaries, accounted for 50 percent, the representatives from the three armedservices stationed in Shanghai 19 percent, and revolutionary cadres 31 percent. Thestanding committee of the Shanghai RC would consist of 13 to 15 persons...all thecommittee members were not fixed. "93 That the Shanghai RC put the quota of massorganization representatives around 50 percent was not coincidental. As I mentionabove, in Mao's talks with Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan, when they discussedthe case of the new power organi in Shanxi after the seizure of power during theJanuary Storm, 53 per cent delegates were rebels, 27 per cent army members, and 20per cent cadres.AndMaopraised theseproportions of differentpoliticalforces in thenew power organs so highly, arguing that “Shanghai ought to learn from them[Shanxi].*94 The stress on the rebels' role in the new power organ reflected MaoZedong and the Maoist rebels'vision of a wholly new form of state structure, withinwhichthebroadestmassescoulddirectlymanagethestateaffairsundertheleadershipoftheParty.

At the end of the rally of February 24, Xu Jingxn, the leader of intellectuals93FromZhuYongjiasMemoir,citedfromiXunTheeadershipandAministrativeet-upoftheShanghiPeople'sCommuneandtheShanghaiRevolutionaryCommittee(ShanghairenmingongsheheShanghaishigeming weiyuanhui lingdao chengyuan he ban'gong jigou shezhi), in electronic magazine “Memory”(jiyi), No.9March30,200994MaoZedong,Talks atThreeMeetingswithComradesChang Ch'un-ch’iao and YaoWen-yuan,February1967,Selected Works of Mao Tse-tung:Vol. IX,published in India by Kranti Publications,Secunderabad,andSramikavargaPrachuranalu,Hyderabad.Available online athttp://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-9/mswv9_73.htm,citedOctober9,2009

493and rebel functionaries of government agencies, announced the draft of “The CurrentSituation and the Tasks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai'-- ,which actually served as the founding document of the Shanghai RC. It specifiedthat, “All basic-level mass organizations, in a general way, cannot retain workingpersonnel not engaged in production. The numbers of working personnel ofrevolutionary mass organizations at the city, district, county and enterprise levels mustbe reduced to a minimum by all means." In addition, this decision appealed to allmass organizations to conduct open-door rectification, to be more democratic, and tobe frugal.9 Explicitly showing commitment to the Paris Commune as a model, allrebel worker leaders who assumed top posts, such as bureau chiefs, or other leadingcadre positions in the Shanghai RC, earned a salary equal to what they originallyreceived as workers, only 50 to 60 yuan a month. “This salary restriction was in starkcontrast to theformer cadres,whogarnered three tofour times as muchforcomparable assignments,*96

In the pre-CR era, from 1949 to 1966, the Chinese legal system was basicallyat the disposal of three organs, that is, the police, the procuracy, and the courts.Together with the army, they were the most important and formidable state organs ofdictatorship. They were also common establishments of the modern state. But duringthe CR, the masses accused these three organs of taking the Liu-Dengist line, failingto carry out the mass line, abusing their power, and even suppressing the revolution95TheCurrentSituation andtheTasksof theGreat ProletarianCulturalRevolutioninShanghai DangqianShanghai wenhua da geming de xingshi he renwu), in Hongqi,No.4, March 1 1967.PerrylizabtrmaristtarisftEastandackrkrsCitizensindrnhangaComparative Studies in Society and History,Vol.41,No.2(April 1999),p.363.

494Mao repeatedly urged Xie Fuzhi, the Minister of Public Security,to"smashgongjianfa" (public security organs, procuratorial organs, and people's courts). OnAugust 7, 1967, in a mass rally to struggle with the former Minister of Public SecurityLuo Ruiqing,Xie Fuzhi expressed that it should be the masses who supervise thepublic security organs, not, as it was with the Soviet KGB, where the public securityorgans supervise the masses. The Soviet-style public and internal security organs, byseeking privilege and detaching themselves from the masses, became revisionist toolsthat suppressed the masses. The power of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security, Xieinsisted, was too big and it needed to be greatly reduced to a level that the commonpeople could handle. In this rally, Xie Fuzhi officially and publicly called on themasses torebel against and smash the oldstatepower apparatus of thepoliceprocuracy, and courts."/ Thereafter, these old pillars of the state were under fierceattacks from the rebels and hence underwent major changes. "In order to simplify,improve and transform the structure which was not suitable to a socialist economicbasis, and to simplify the procedure in the jurisdictional sphere for the convenience ofthe masses", the functions and powers of the original public security organs and courtswere greatly contained, and the procuracy was even abolished with its functions andits powers were transferred to the public security agency.98 In December 1968,simultaneous with the dismantling of the procuracy, it was proposed that the other twoCentral organs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (neiwubu) and the Office of Internal9ieFuhizaigonganbudohengluqingdahuihangdejinghXFuzhisspchattherallftMinistry ofPublicSecurity to struggle againstLuoRuiqing),August 7,1967,in the Wuchan jieji wenhuadageming tongxun(theNewsletter of the GreatProletarian CR),No.3,reprinted by duoqizhi commando of theEast Is Red Commune in the Supreme Court,August 12,1967.98Shao-ChuanLeng,HungdahChiued.riminalJstice inPost-MaoChina:AnalysisandDocntsSUNYPress,1985,p.18.

495Affairs (neiwuban),be abolished as well,while the Ministry of Public Security andthe Supreme Court only kept very few staff.9? Mao and Xie Fuzhi strongly arguedthat it was not a good method to arrest people; that the government, the publicsecurity organs,and the army should arrest as fewpeople as possible; and that arrestsshouldbedoneonthedemandsandwiththeaidofthemasses.Asforthefewbadpeople, it was better to have them arrested by the masses themselves, not by the stateorgans of dictatorship.ro° Mao called this principle the “dictatorship of the masses'(qunzhong zhuanzheng).1°1 He explicitly said that: “the dictatorship should be thedictatorship of the masses.*102

During the CR, the Shanghai RC by and large followed Mao and Xie Fuzhi'sinstructions about the dictatorship of the masses. On March 21, 1967, at a meeting ofthe Shanghai RC, Zhang Chunqiao urged that the Shanghai Public Security organs besmashed. 103 At the time, many organizations of the dictatorship of the masses wereset up in various units and places in Shanghai, especially at the level of lanes andstreets.Aspeechgivenby oneof thePartysecretaries of theShanghaiRCXuJingxian at a mass rally on June 24, 1968 stipulated that with the exception of a few9 Wanzhong Sun, Shaohua You, Yongchang Wang ed., Zhonghua Renmin Gongheguo falu dashidian Book ofMajorLegalEvents inPRC),Zhongguo zhengfa daxue chubanshe,1993,p.283.10XieFuzhizaigonganbudouzheng uoRuiqingdahuishangdejianghua XieFuzhi'seechatherallyof theMinistry ofPublicSecurity to struggleagainst LuoRuiqing),August 7,1967,in theWuchan jieji wenhuadageming tongxun(the Newsletter of the Great Proletarian CR),No.3,reprinted by duoqizhi commando of theEast Is Red Commune in theSupreme Court,August 12,1967.101 On August 4,1967,in ne of his letters toJiang QingMao said: "One of themost important issues tobsolved in the current CR is the dictatorship of the masses" (Wang Li, Chronicles of the Cultural Revolution, pp.90-91).According toXie Fuzhi's speech three days later, Mao had mentioned toXie at least eight times that it wasnecessary to smash the police,procuracy,and courts.Judging from Xie's talk, such thoughts of Mao can be tracedbacktoearliermonths.1022MaoZedong,Shichahuabeizhongnanhehuadongdiqushidetanhua(Mao'sTalksDuring theInspectionTourof theNorthChina,Central-South,andEastChinaRegions),inJuly-Septemberof1967,inTheManuscriptsofMaoZedongSince theFoundation of thePRC(Jianguoyilai MaoZedongwengao),Vol.12.p.386.Beijing:Zhongyangwenxianchubanshe,1988.03SeeShanghaigonganzhidashijiShanghaiPublicurityGazeteer:Choronicleathttp://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node2245/node4476/node58280/index.htmlCitedonJune1,2009.

496cases of active counter-revolutionaries who conducted murder, arson,poisoningsabotage of state secrets who needed tobe arrested, most other wrongdoers should notbe arrested but instead should be put back into their own units.And they should besubjected to the supervision of the masses - as it was the masses in their units thatknew them best.To expound the efficiency of the dictatorship of the masses,XuJingxian gave an example of a wrongdoer in a Shanghai unit who asked the publicsecurity force to arrest him because he could not bear the all-around supervision of themasses.104 Of course, for the wrongdoers who were willing to reform themselves, themasses would be willing to help at any time. In such a way, the amount of money thathad been spent in the past on the police, procuracy, and courts was greatly reducedMore importantly, the crime rate was dramatically reduced. During the CR, under theguidance of the thought of the dictatorship of the masses,in many places,including inShanghai, a large number of prisons were abandoned and a large portion of theinmates were released to their original units and subject to the masses supervision.105During the CR, generally speaking, every rural commune only had one specialcommissioner from the public security organ (gong'an tepaiyuan) stationed.

497disputes and disposing minor criminal cases at the grassroots level."“The informalprocess of dispute resolution enjoyed its heyday under Mao when the societal modelof law overshadowed the jural model.*106

Such measures of the new power organ arising from the January Storm duringthe CR, whether it was done in the name of commune, or in the name of RC, to quoteMarx,“made that catchword of bourgeois revolutions - cheap government - areality." One of the necessary “evils" and greatest source of expenditures by aproletarian state—the standing army—was yet to be abolished and replaced by apeople's militia in the future.1o7 But the heavy burden of state administration andbureaucracy were considerably relieved by streamlining things and by the workersactive participation in running the RCs.

Partially out of distrust of the regular army, the Shanghai rebels, under theleadership of Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen in the Shanghai RC, tried toeventually use the armed workers'militia to replace or at leastbalance the regularmilitary forces. This led to the rapid development of the so-called“a second armedforces (di'er wuzhuang)” in Shanghai, which mainly consisted of militias of the urbanworkersundertherebels'control.Toreplacetheregulararmywiththemilitiawasseen by Marx as one of the major hallmarks of the Paris Commune. This wasconsidered by theMaoists as another way of exercising the dictatorship of themasses106 Shao-ChuanLeng,Hungdah Chiued,Criminal Justice in Post-Mao China: Analysis and Documents SUNYPress,1985,p.68.107What needs tobe clarified is that the standing army in the Maoera is very different than the bourgeois standingarmy. For example,the socialist standing army is in close touch with the masses in order to serve the people,whereas the bourgeois standing armybasically serves the interests of the exploiting class.Especiallyin China,strange as it may seem,thesocialist standing army partially earned their own living through productive laborwhereas the bourgeois standing army totally depends on state funds for their expenditures. Nevertheless, thesocialist standing army still retained vestiges of the old armies and needed to be replaced eventually by people'smilitias.

498In August 1967, echoing Jiang Qing's viewpoint that the rebels should be armed,Zhang Chunqiao said: "It's better to organize and arm the workers, going from smallto large, from bare hands to weapons, gradually building an armed force of the peoplewith the rebels as its basic component." On September 1, 1967, the ShanghaiHeadquarters of Wengong Wuwei (attacking with words and defending with weapons)was set up. This was the first rebel militia entity in Shanghai. Wang Hongwen evenordered twoShanghai factories to manufacture rifles for the rebel militia.Meanwhilemany heavy weapons from the army's supply were distributed to the workers’ militia.Until January 1968, 28 Shanghai factories set up contingents of wengong wuwei, withthe total number reaching 7,900 fighters. In 1970, all Shanghai factories set upwengong wuwei teams, with the total number reaching 29,000 fighters. The deputydirector of the Shanghai RC Wang Hongwen stipulated that the militia teams shouldbe led by the old rebels and the positions of officers above battalion level should begiven to the rebels. In May 197o, the Shanghai Headquarters of Wengong Wuwei wasrenamed as the "Shanghai Militia".At that time, Wang Hongwen instructed: "Fromnow on, the militia must be run by the local people (minban), not governmentalorgans (guanban). If officially operated, the militia would be run by the army, but ifrun by the masses,the militia should be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai RC."18By 1973, more than a hundred thousand workers’ militia, including numerous groundforces,five artillerybattalions,three antiaircraft machine gun companies,and amotorcycle regiment, were set up in Shanghai. And the Shanghai rebels also prepared108 Yangpu qu zhi (Records of Yangpu District in Shanghai), seehttp://www.shtong.gov.cn/node2/node4/node2249/yangpu/node46155/node61198/index.html, cited onFebruary 5,2010.

499toestablish a corps of engineers,an anti-chemical warfare corps, a signal corps, and aradar corps. Wang Hongwen even tried to institute a “National Militia CommandPost" under rebel control. On Dec. 15, 1974, the Ministry of Public Security issued"The Notice of Printing and Distributing Two Materials by the Party Committee of theShanghai No. 17 Mills Concerning Implementing the Triadic Integrated Entirety ofthe Militia, Public Security and Fire Fighting Work", which greatly enhanced thestatus of the militia under the dominant control of the rebels.109 On January 17, 1975,the legal status of the people's militia was written into the new constitution. Thepeople's militia was considered as important as the standing army. Article 15 of the1975 constitution stipulated: “The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people'smilitia are the workers' and peasants' own armed forces led by the Communist Partyof China; they are the armed forces of the people of all nationalities.*110OnSeptember 18, 1975, when meeting with the leaders of the Shanghai MilitiaCommand, Wang Hongwen stressed, "Some people say that it is not orthodox for themilitia to take care of the class struggle; some people accuse us of establishing asecond armed forces in Shanghai. What is orthodoxy? We must serve the needs of theclass struggle,the needs ofsocialist revolution and socialist construction....Ifsomebody strikes down the militia twenty years later, I will straighten it up again ifI'm still alive then." When learning that the weapons were stored in the regular army'swarehouse, Wang suggested distributing them to the militiamen as they were not safe109LaoShi YuanYuhua),Womenbuyaoyigejingcha shijie:wengezhongdekanjanfangfanyuMaoZedongde‘qunzhongzhuanzheng”qiantan(We don't Need aWorld of Police:A PlainRemark on theCampaign ofCancelling the Prisons and Releasing the Inmates During the CR and Mao Zedong's Thought of the Dictatorship ofthe Masses), see http://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class14/200712/29496.html, cited on February 4, 2010.110The Constitution of thePeople'sRepublic of China,Peking:ForeignLanguagesPress,1975.

500in the armed forces'warehouse. Wang said, when war breaks out, “We should getready to go to the mountains and fight as guerrillas,”’ and added that the workersmilitia could “fight against enemies inside and outside simultaneously. 1l1 OnMarch 30,1976, the People's Armed Forces Department (renwubu),which wasoriginally under the leadership of the army, was incorporated into the new militiaheadquarters controlled by the rebels.1i? This on the one hand, weakened thetraditional standing army, and on the other hand, strengthened Shanghai's “SeconcArmed Force"under the masses' control. Approaching the end of the CR, therebel-controlled Shanghai militia had 3,000,000 soldiers equipped with 226,000 guns1,900 cannons, 2,600 rocket launchers, 500 tanks, and a warship, which was capableof challenging the regular military..113

Marx said that with regard to the Paris Commune that"neither cheapgovernment nor the ‘true republic’was its ultimate aim; they were its mereconcomitants." The true secret of the Shanghai Commune, the Heilongjiang RedRebel RC, and the Shanghai RC, in terms of this remark by Marx, was that they wereessentiallyformsofworkers'powersduringtheCR.Neverbeforeweretheresomanytrueworkerrebelsrepresentedinthepower organs;neverbeforeweretheresomanyChinese workers armed with guns and artillery; never before were Chinese workers soproud to be workers and their conscious mastering of the state and society so greatly111 Yan Jiaqi and Gao Gao,“Turbulent Decade: A History of the Cultural Revolution", translated and edited by D.W.

501strengthened. With the advancement of the CR, Mao cried in 1968 that“the workingclass must exercise leadership in everything." As Raymond Lotta et al pointed out."The Cultural Revolution and the creation of new revolutionary organs, like theRevolutionary Committees, involved masses of people and their representatives on adramatically enlarged scale at every level. It involved unprecedented means fonensuring that the participation of the masses was genuine and profound; throughextremely widespread debate and discussion, through continuing political-ideologicalstruggle, and through direct leadership responsibility. By 1973, an estimated fortythousand workers in Shanghai held leading positions in factories, other work units,and higher level municipal organs."114By the close of the CR decade, at variouslevels, Shanghai units were fully saturated with workers' Mao Zedong Thoughtpropaganda teams, workers' theory troops,workers'Party members,workers' newcadres,workers’writers, and soforth.After thePRC resumed membershipin theUnited Nations in 1971, Shanghai even trained 113 worker diplomats who would havebeen stationed all over the world should the so-called “gang of four” not been arrested;and Zhang Chunqiao even specifically instructed that more female diplomats from theworkers? ranks be trained.115 With the leadership of the proud working class,Shanghai achieved tremendous political and economic success during the CR yearsAs with the Shanghai's economy, even according to the Deng Xiaoping regime'snational statistics in the De-MaoinizationEra (qumaohua shiqi),during the third114 Raymond Lott, Nayi Duniya, and K.

For example, “Shanghai had posted over half a millionskilled workers to the interior and poorer regions of the country——sharing expertiseand learning from other segments and sectors of society. Further, during the years ofthe Cultural Revolution, Shanghai retained only 10 percent of its locally generatedrevenue, the rest going to the national budget, helping to subsidize the spendingrequirements of the poorer regions, like Xinjiang and Tibet.*'117AftertheReformeraDeng Xiaoping authorized Shanghai retaining the major portion of its revenue.Consequently, Shanghai has grown into a booming major international metropoliswithin a short time. Yet this has happend at the price of the underdevelopment ofChinese inland regions. In a sense, since the Deng era, Shanghai (and Shenzhenamong other cities) has been responsible for the underdevelopment of many otherplaces in China. The coup d'etat in 1976 put an end to the“socialist new things" intheir blooming stage. Even though the Shanghai RC kept its name until December1979, all the rebel representatives were put in jail and almost all the worker116 Sun Huairang ed., A Short History of theDevelopment of the Shanghai'sSocialist Economic Construction,1949-1985(Shanghai shehuizhuyi jinji jianshe fazhan jianshi,1949-1985),Shanghai: Shanghai renmin chubanshe,1990,pp.472-489.117Raymond Lotta,Nayi Duniya, and K.

Conclusion

A Revolution,not aFarce

When remarking on Hegel's statement that all facts and personages of greatimportance in world history occurred twice, Karl Marx added, “the first time astragedy, the second as farce."f Marx further depicted this kind of reoccurrence as acaricature. Even though later commentators applied Marx's depiction to serve variouspurposes, it is obvious that Marx, taking sides with the exploited classes, wascommenting on the personages and events related to the exploiting classes, especiallythe bourgeois class. Marx would never sneer at the revolutionary cause of workingpeople as a “farce" or “caricature". Those who jeer at the struggle of the workingclass against the enslavement of labor by capital, if not beingmanipulated or deceivedby the elite,are usually from the ranks of the exploiting classes. One class's tragedybecomes a farce in the eyes of its rival classes. This is exactly what happened to therevolutionary power organ of Shanghai born out of the January Storm during the CRAfter thehistorical curtain wasbrought down on theCR in1976,the narratives of thetriumphant restorationists who had waged a Thermidor coup depicted both theShanghai Commune patterned after the Paris Commune and the following ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee under workers’ control during Mao's time, as a monstrousstill-birth. The rebel workers’ seizure of power and the operation of the more1 K. Marx, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte in MECW, Vol, 11, p.103.

505democraticgovernmentofShanghaiwerejeered atascreatinga"farce".TheShanghai rebel leaders were labeled as“new bourgeois elements"and demonized as“gangsters". But 40 years later, it has become crystal clear who the real“newbourgeois elements"were and who instrumentalized the farce. The real farce, first ofall, lies in that the post-Mao regimes upheld the socialist and communist banner whenthey were in fact carrying out a sweeping bourgeois CR'. They waved red flags tooppose the red flag.When there was no authentic worker representation at any levelof statepower,thepost-Maoregimes still claimed that theyweregovernments of theworking class. But they never intended to be a government run by the workers andthey could not be considered a working people's regime. Hypocrisy, as always, is atypical characteristic of thebourgeois class.

The Shanghai Commune and its legal successor, the Shanghai RC - whichtragically ended in 1976 in a ruthless coup that was against millions of pro-CRactivists -was not a farce at all. It was the working class'powerful and heroicstruggleto retakestatepower from thosepower holderswhonolongerserved thepeople. It was an organic continuation of the proletarian revolutions in China andelsewhereintheworld,notablytheParisCommuneandtheRussianBolshevikRevolution. Of course,similar to every revolution, the Shanghai January Revolution2Arif Dirlik thinks that simultaneous with the Chinese proletarian CR, there was also a bourgeois CR,in somesense a postmodernist CR that took placein the global capitalist society.Inspired byDirlik but disagreeing with hisassertion that“Thanks to its revolutionarylegacy,rather than the antirevolutionary authoritarian propensities of thecurrent Communist regime,in other words,Chinese society not only continues to offer a model of alternativemodernity that challenges thehegemony of capitalism,but also offers concrete resolutions toproblems that areproducts of the reconfiguration of global relations under contemporary capitalism," I am inclined to think that thepost-Mao China, which have been virtually stripped of all its socialist color, has been undergoing a far-reachingbourgeois CRwith some characteristics of postmodernism due toitsre-linking with the capitalistworld order andthe Liu-Dengist antirevolutionary authoritarian propensities. Arif Dirlik's view could be found in his article ^TheTwo CulturalRevolutions:The Chinese Cultural Revolutionin thePerspective of Global Capitalism",inArifDirlik,Marxism in the ChineseRevolution,Rowman&Littlefield,2005,pp.165-182.

506of1967simultaneouslyentailedhistoricalcontradictionsofpossibilityandimpossibility, continuity and discontinuity, and contingency and necessity. As Marxsaid,

Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please;they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, butunder circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted fromthepast.The tradition of all thedeadgenerationsweighslike anightmare on the brain of the living. And just when they seem engagedin revolutionizing themselves and things, in creating something thathas never yet existed, precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisisthey anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service andborrow from them names, battle-cries and costumes in order to presentthe new scene of world history in this time-honoured disguise and thisborrowedlanguage.3

Marx's remarks about how men make history were a comment on thebourgeois revolutions. But it could be perfectly applied to the Shanghai Commune.For the Chinese Maoist rebels, the Chinese revolution was in crisis on the eve of theCR because of the degradation of parts of the state bureaucracy and even the Partyitself. From the very beginning, the socialist advance toward communism wasinterrupted and sabotaged by the “capitalist roaders taking authority within the Party",represented notably by the Liu-Dengists. When the Chinese revolution was in crisis,i.e. in a period of revolutionary crisis, revolutionary chaos had to be fomented in orderto transform and reconstruct the society according to the Maoists'long-cherishedrevolutionary values and spirit. At this moment, the specter of the past, conspicuouslythe Paris Commune, was conjured up. As I have argued here, the values and spirit ofthe Paris Commune have been continuously transmitted for nearly one hundred yearsMarx,Karl, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, in MECW, Vol.11, pp.103-104.

507from Paris, Russia, among other places, to China.Inspired by the Russian SovietrevolutionthatcontinuedthecauseoftheParisCommune,Chineserevolutionariesestablished Commune regimes twice in1927. Their defeat was a tragedy,but not afarce. Several decades later, the Chinese dream of the Paris Commune was conjuredup andputintopracticeagaininthelater1950swhentensofthousandsof agriculturalPeople's Communes were established throughout the nation. When the Liu-Dengistswithin the Party tried to disband the People's Communes on the pretext of the partialfailure of the Great Leap Forward, the Maoists in the Party, as guardians of theChinese dream of the Paris Commune, resolutely fought against them. On the eve andduring the early stage of the CR, the Maoists, "under circumstances directlyencountered, given and transmitted from the past", notably, under the Chinese visionand practice of the Paris Commune, called on the masses to seek a brand-new form ofstate structure modeled upon theParis Commune to replace the existing one.TheMaoists did not revive the Paris Commune from their wild fantasy, nor did they makehistory as they pleased. Rather, they conjured up models from their revolutionaryheritage. The claim that Mao and his followers' call to build upon the Paris Communewas merely a ruse, or “flirting", as Harry Harding suggested,4 is more or lessmisleading.When the Maoists were busy revolutionizing themselves theirsurroundings in “creating something that has never yet existed", and in the quest for anew state structure, the most convenient and attractive political resources they couldresort to and employ were notfrom the allegedly degenerated revisionistSoviet Union,4SeeRoderick MacFarquhar,JohnK.Fairbank,DenisTwitchett ed.,Cambridge History of China:ThePeople'sRepublic,Part 2:RevolutionsWithin the ChineseRevolution,1966-1982,CambridgeUniversityPress,1991.p.162.

508but from the first working people's government—the Paris Commune that Marx, thegreatest mentor of communist movements,had praised.

Since theMaoistleadershad called on themassestolearnfrom theParisCommune, when the name of the Shanghai Commune was changed to the ShanghaiRevolutionary Committee, Mao and his followers were understandably denounced asthe “betrayers" and “arch criminals" of the working people's cause by some peopleBut as I discussed in previous chapters, Mao himself never advocated a strictimplementation of the original shape and configuration of the Paris Commune insocialist China. Rather, he saw the Paris Commune as something to use as a model forChina in terms of its principles and spirit. Above all, “the working class cannot simplylay hold of the ready-made State machinery, and wield it for its own purposes." Theoldmustbesmashedwhereasthenewshouldbeestablished,butthenewdidnotnecessary have to assume the same shape as past models such as theParis CommuneAgain, Marx's further remarks on the bourgeois revolution were applicable to theworkingclassrevolution:

The resurrection of the dead in those revolutions served the purpose ofglorifying the new struggles, not of parodying the old; of magnifyingthe given task in imagination, not of fleeing from its solution in reality;of finding once more the spirit of revolution, not of making its ghostwalk about again.

The Maoist rebels’resurrection of the Parisian communards in Shanghai wasnot to replicate all aspects of the Paris Commune in the past century, but to upholdand celebrate the ongoing new struggles in the storm of the CR. The new struggles5 Marx, Karl, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, in MECW, Vol.11, p.105..

509aimed tocast asidethe degeneratedparts of thebureaucracy and thosepartsof theParty that were onto the track of a capitalist road. It attempts to urge the degeneratedpower holders to return to the socialist and communist line of serving the peopleWhen the Liu-Dengist power holders put the Maoist revolutionaries under pressureand rejected their petition for re-revolutionizing by encouraging the wind ofeconomism and carrying out general strikes, the Maoists had to upgrade theirstruggles to a full scale power seizure from the power holders. Therefore, theintensified newstrugglewasfirst of all not designed to establish a revolutionarydemocratic power organ similar to that of the Paris Commune, but to establish a newrevolutionary socialist power organ by adopting a wholly new form of state structureAs I have argued before, even though in classical Marxist interpretations, the ParisCommune is a concrete example of a dictatorship of the proletariat, it is just arudimentary one and not a dictatorship of the proletariat under socialism. It was more,as Lenin labeled it, a revolutionary democratic dictatorship that did not abolish privateproperty. As we know, the anti-Paris Commune bourgeois forces and their followerswere largely excluded from Paris. Moreover, the Paris Commune did not produce avisible political agenda to expropriate the expropriators, even though it might havesuch intentions in keeping with Marx's hypothesis. Therefore, by winning the healthyparts of the bourgeoisie over, the Paris Commune was able to institute a generalelection and functioned as a revolutionary democratic power organ in1871. But todate a socialist government has never been successfully elected through universalsuffrage at the state level, which abolishes class-property that makes the labour of the

510manythewealthofthefew.

InChina,afterMaoretiredtothesecondfront tofocusontheoreticalstudiesand left day-to-day state affairs to the Liu-Dengists in the late 1950s, the Liu-Dengistswithin the CCP (who tended to manage China in a capitalist way) had control of themajor state and Party resources. As a result, they gained tremendous influence amongthe people. This was mainly due to the high prestige of the Party as a whole that wasgained through the defeat of the Japanese invaders, the Nationalist armies, and theUnited Nations' troops in the Korean War; and with the achievements in nationbuilding and socialist construction. After the ruthless suppression of outspoken criticsof the Party in the Anti-Rightist Movement, the Liu-Dengist faction actively preacheda philosophy of "being servile tools for the Party" leading to the condition before theCR that oridinary people dared not question the official Liu-Dengist policies. Due tothe nontransparent nature of policy-making process in the Liu-Dengist bureaucracy.people had noway of knowingwhether policies with capitalist tendencies weremerely experimental and expediential, or if they were forays aimed at capitalistrestoration. Therefore, when the Liu-Dengists propagated san zi yi bao aimed atdismantling the Peoples'Communes, the masses did not stage major resistancesWithout the opposition from the Maoists, China might have dissolved the collectiveeconomy before the CR. In fact, regardless of Mao's repeated call for rebellion, themajor bulk of the masses supported Party committees at various levels, which meanobjectively supporting the pre-CR order and the Liu-Dengist bureaucracy. Under suchcircumstances,coupledwith theinternecinestruggles amongtherebelswhichwere

511partly instigated by the power holders, any attempt to copy, or wholesale, the oldstruggles in the Paris Commune (e.g. the simple institution of a general election aimedat faithfully setting up a Chinese Paris Commune in Shanghai), could lead to thereturn of the pre-CR order and deepen the degeneration toward capitalism for thewhole society. To invoke the Parisian communards in the 1960s in Shanghai, or to useMarx's words, was to“magnify the given task"”of developing the dictatorship of theproletariat and to continue the revolution from socialism to communism. It was not to“flee from its solution in reality", which is subjecting power holders to the strictsupervision of the politically-conscious masses so as to prevent the power holdersfrom forming any vested interest groups and detaching themselves from the masses.The spirit of revolution of the Paris Commune, that is, the spirit of smashing the oldand establishing the new, surely should be invoked. But it was not necessary to let theghostof thepastwalk about again.

In fact, when discussing the proletariat revolution, Marx averred that it couldnot draw its poetry from the past,but onlyfrom the future:

It cannot begin with itself before it has stripped off all superstitionabout the past. Earlier revolutions required recollections of past worldhistory in order to dull themselves to their own content. In order toarrive at its own content, the revolution of the nineteenth century mustlet the dead bury their dead. There the words went beyond the content;here the content goes beyond thewords

These words were written by Marx in 1851-1852. In all the previousrevolutions, the working class did not aim at seizing state power and establishing itsowngovernment.Every time, the workers had willingly subjected themselves to the

512leadershipofthebourgeoisieandhencesurrenderedtheirweaponstothelatterWithout any hesitation, the bourgeoisie used the surrendered weapons to butcher theworking people. Given such a history, Marx solemnly warned the working people notto dull themselves with recollections of the past, and urged them to overcome allsuperstition about past class wars. When Marx said that the working class shoulddraw its poetry only from the future, he was talking about fighting for the creation ofunprecedented things in history; that the struggle of the working class should befuture-oriented, toward abolishing class property, toward emancipating labor fromcapital, and toward the withering away of all previous state forms. Twenty years later,in keeping with Marx's admonition, the Parisian communards realized their aim bysetting up the first working people's government in the world. Thereafter, Marx neveragain reiterated his previous admonition. Rather, he repeatedly urged the workingpeople to draw lessons from the Paris Commune and predicted that the Communemodelwouldbeestablishedinthewholeworld.Fromthishistoricalevent,theworking people should draw its poetry from both the future and the past.

On the one hand, the Shanghai rebels in 1967 smashed the old ready-madestate apparatus operating since 1949, and replaced it with a three-in-one combinationby invoking the name of the Paris Commune and inheriting the legacy of the pastproletarian revolutions in China and the West. On the other hand, it was by no meansa faithful replica of the Paris Commune, nor was it a dogmatic implementation in allof its concrete aspects. The Shanghai rebels did not conduct a general electionbecause at that moment the masses were still confused about what capitalism was and

513whotherealcapitalistroaderswere.Undersuchcircumstances,thegeneralelectionmight nothavebeen anefficientwaytoprevent thosewith acapitalistworldviewfrom taking power. Instead, the Shanghai Commune adopted a preliminary form of atriple combination of rebels, revolutionary cadres and representatives from the armyThis was a new socialist entity and a product of class struggle at the time. First of all,it was not possible to win the struggle by overthrowing all the veteran cadres whowere mostly and basically good, having made great contributions during the war andsocialist construction. Secondly, since the PLA troops were ordered to support the"Leftists", they had to be given their share of power in the new government, at leastduring the turbulent period that required the authority of the troops to restore the order.Thirdly, since the power seizure was basically initiated by the rebels, they had everyright to act as the major player in the new power regime. As a matter of fact, bysetting the quota of rebel representatives at more than50 percent,theleftistelementsfrom the masses began to exert overwhelming influence on the new popular powerorganofShanghai

The Shanghai Commune was not a Chinese replica of the Paris Commune; theParis andShanghai Communeswerenot mirrorimages.TheShanghai Communeneither abolished the regular troops, nor did it have a visible agenda to run a generalelection within a short time.Many critics used theSixteen-point Program (in whichthe Paris Commune-type general election was mentioned) as evidence to accuse theMaoist leadership of betraying their initial promise. But the cultural revolutionarygroups, committees and congresses—which were authorized as power organs of the

514CR andwerestipulatedbytheSixteen-pointProgramtoinstitute ageneralelection(like that of theParis Commune)—were just mass organizations that supposedlysupplemented, not supplanted, the Party and the state power organs. In this sense, themass organizations that consisted of the Shanghai Commune, more or less obeyed therule to democratically elect leaders and delegates into the new power organ ofShanghai. (In fact, as I argued here, in some sense it is even hard to regard the ParisCommune as running universal suffrage since a major part of the Parisian population,those who fled toVersailles or those who were women, did not participate in thegeneral election at that time.) Furthermore, the official CCP documents never statedthat the mass organizations should replace the whole Party or state power organsInstead, they had to be under the leadership of the Party. After the January Revolutionin 1967, the power of the old SPC was taken over by an alliance of massorganizations.But these organizations still acknowledged thePartyleadershipfromthe Center, and they did not have any intention of sharing the power theyhad seizedwith other political forces through the agency of a general election.Furthermore, tosimply equate the Shanghai Commune to the Paris Commune is misguided andmisleading.Similarly,to chargeMaowith thenominalshift of theShanghaiCommune to the Shanghai RC as telling evidence for his betrayal of the rebels and thespirit of the Paris Commune, was a wild and misguided conjecture. Firstly, I arguedthat virtually nobody in the Shanghai Commune proposed to abolish the regular armyand the party. Secondly, after the nominal shift, almost all delegates from variousrebel factions which constituted the Shanghai Commune remained unchanged in the

515new Shanghai RC. Thirdly, all the official decrees, notices, and decisions issued bythe Shanghai Commune still functioned under the Shanghai RC. Fourthly, the biggestdifference between the Shanghai Commune and the Shanghai RC was that the latterincorporated more old Party cadres who publicly expressed support for the rebels thanthe Commune, but their role remained secondary compared to that of the Shanghairebels until the end of the Maoist era.° In summation, the Shanghai Commune wasnot “disbanded"as many commentators have claimed; at the most, its name waschanged. By renaming it the Shanghai RC, the Shanghai Commune basicallycontinued with a new title. In this sense, the Shanghai RC should not be considered asa totalnegationof theShanghaiCommune.

The January Storm in 1967 was by no means “not a revolution in any sense",as the post-Mao Chinese regimes claimed. Compared to the pre-CR local state powerorgan, the Shanghai Commune and the Shanghai RC posted major differences inmanyways.As thefruits of theJanuaryStorm,theywerewholly newforms ofrevolutionary state structure. On the one hand, the Shanghai Commune was not a totalnegation of the Party and the state, as some thinkers such as Alain Badiou or SlavojZizek idealized. The Shanghai Commune and the ensuing Shanghai RC, on the otherhand, had some characteristics of the communal semi-state power organ. With theformation of the Shanghai Commune and the ensuing Shanghai RC, the old statemachinery with the strong support of the regular army, police, judicature andbureaucratic systems, which originated from systematic and hierarchical division of6 In many other places, the rebels'role in the new power organs was usually secondary compared with those of thearmy and the old Party cadres. This was decided by the previous power struggles among the three parties, in whichtherebelswereusuallytheweakestforce.

516labor in modern society, underwent major changes.To some extent, the old statemachinery started thelong process of withering away. The two greatest sources ofexpenditure—statefunctionarism(bureaucracies) and the standing army—werereduced greatly under the political framework of the Shanghai Commune and theShanghai RC. The standing army was urged to participate in production and transforminto a big school of revolution. As the army partially earned its own bread, the stateexpenditure on it was greatly reduced. As with the state functionarism, first of all, theShanghai Commune simultaneously abolished the old SPC and the old ShanghaiPeople's Committee. The two local state power organs were combined to form oneunified structure under the framework of the Shanghai Commune, thus getting rid ofredundancy and bulky bureaucratic establishments. This unification of the Party andthe government within one single administrative structure was closer to Marx's idealCommunal state within which the working people's power organ was a working body."executive and legislative at the same time."7 Under the new framework of theShanghai Commune, in addition to representatives from the army and old Party cadres.all the administrators were drawn from ordinarypeople,especially common workerswhowereelectedorrecommendedbytheiraffiliatedmass organizations.Eventheoldcadre had to be initially recommended by the mass organizations. This meant that if acadre was not recommended by any mass organizations,he or she could immediatelylose the chance to be chosen as a leader in the new power organ. In addition, all therebel delegates intheShanghai Communewererequired toreport totheir own7MECw.Volume22.,p.331

517factions regularly, and were subject to the supervision and recall by their own factionsat any time.All worker representatives, no matter what positions they held in the theShanghai Commune and Shanghai RC, were roughly paid the same salaries as theyhad previously received in their original units. Furthermore, participation in manuallabor was compulsory for all administrators in the Shanghai Commune and theensuing Shanghai RC. The gap in terms of differences in status between the leaders ofthe power organ and the broad masses was therefore narrowed.

During the CR, the Chinese legal system even in Shanghai underwent majorrevolutionary changes. The functions and powers of the original public securityorgans and courts were greatly reduced. The procuracy, along with some otherCentral organs, was even abolished. These measures, according to Marx's views, wereto rescue the society from the state,and to diminish the influence of the state andhence to gradually wither it away. The development of the militia under the control ofthe masses in Shanghai, and downplaying the role of the standing army through suchthings as incorporating the People's Armed Forces Department into the ShanghaiMilitia, should also be seen as a significant advancement toward the construction ofthesemi-state,and ultimatelythestateless communalsociety

Now I would like to explain why the Chinese socialist cause suffered majorsetbacks after the deathof Mao.Thisis socomplicated that it isfarbeyond the scope

518of thisdissertation toexplain it in a comprehensivemanner.HereIwill approach itfrom only oneperspective:themass organizations.

The CR was a social revolution with the goal of empowering the masses.AsMao, Xie Fuzhi and other Maoist leaders believed,the pre-CR state apparatusespecially those organs of “proletarian dictature", such as the police, the procuracy.the courts, and even the army and the Party, held too much power. Without strictsupervision of the masses, this kind of “proletarian dictature” might do much harm tothe masses. To some extent, the CR attempted to reduce some of the power that wasoriginally entrusted to the special state power organs. During the CR, some of thefunctions of the standing army and the police were transferred to the people's militiaMany courts works were handled by thousands of People's Mediation Committees.Many bureaucratic state instituations, such as the procuracy, the Ministry of InternalAffairs, and the Department of Central Propaganda, were even abolished.Furthermore, a large portion of the state power was devolved to the grass-roots massorganizations. These organizations mushroomed in the hundreds of thousands amongthe students,workers,peasants,lower-middle functionaries,and even soldiers.Evenonesinglepersoncouldformaone-manfaction

Before the CR, even though the majority of the CCP members could keep theirrevolutionary zeal and serve the people, some of them only intended to extend theirpersonal interests. They joined the Party merely organizationally, not spiritually, thatis, they did this without any real belief in and committment to communism. Theseopportunists who were more interested in protecting and furthering their own interests

519didnothesitatetosuppressthedemocratic rightsof the masses inthe name ofrevolutionandtheParty,ifitservedtheiraims.Theformationofthemassorganizations and the entryof the mass organizations intothe new power organsduring the CR, to a great degree, had far-reaching historical significance. Onlythrough the mass organizations that were relatively independent from the Party andplayed active role in the government, could the common people effectively enjoy theirdemocratic rights and supervise the state and Party. Without this organizational form.it was very hard for the common people todefend their rights and prevent therevolutionary Party and the state from devolving into the enemy of the masses. Duringthe CR, for the first time, the governmental officials were under the direct supervisionof the masses within and outside the state power organs. With the powerful backing ofthe mass organizations, the masses, especially those from the working classbackgrounds, could not only run the factories, but also directly run the state powerorgans. This was a solid measure of “immediate introduction of control andsupervision by all, so that all may become ^bureaucrats’for a time and that, therefore,nobody may be able to become a “bureaucrat',8 To a certain degree, the massorganizations were the revolutionary vehicles of the continuous revolution. The massmovements based on the dynamics of the mass organizations were the embodimentsof the continuous revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat

To be sure, various political forces, from the leftists to the rightists amongothers, could make use of the mass organizations and mass movements to further their8VladimirLenin,TheState and Revolution,inV. 1.Lenin elected Works inThreeVolumes,Vol.2,IntenationalPublishers,1967,p.351,emphasis original.

520owninterests.ThefirstmassorganizationstoemergefromtheCRwereactuallythepro-establishment and The first mass organizations toemerge from the CR wereactuallythepro-establishmentandpro-Liu-DengistoldRedGuards(laohongweibing). In order to highlight their own role and defend their parents who werehigh Party and army cadres, they took up and promoted the “bloodline theory(xuetong lun) that placed extreme importance on a person's class origin. And theyused this as a weapon to monopolize the “revolution",thereby excluding manystudents who did not have good class backgrounds. The old Red Guards’activities,which targeted those with bad family backgrounds, effectively diverted the generalorientation away from the struggle against “the power holders in Party taking thecapitalist road". Therefore, when the rebels arose from the rank and file studentswithout prominent family backgrounds and set the target on the power holders, theyclashed bitterly with so-called old Red Guards on the issue of whether to defend thepre-CR order and establishments. But the decisive turning point of the CR was thestageofthelarge-scaleworkers’movementsattheendof1966.Itwastherebelworkers’ organizations that functioned as a blow to the old bureaucracy in the JanuaryRevolution.

After the defeat of the pro-establishment loyalist worker organizations, theonly card left in the hands of the power holders was the use of economic sabotage andgeneral strike, which resulted in an unexpected full-scale power seizure by the rebelorganizations. After that, new power organs were formed based on the triplecombination of rebels, revolutionary cadres and army representatives. Within the new

521power organs that were formed after the authentic power seizure by the rebel factions,the delegates from the mass organizations usually accounted for the largest body inthe triple combination framework. In Shanxi and Shanghai, for example, the delegatesfrom the mass organizations occupied more than 50 percent of the functionaries in thenew power organs after power seizure. This is the kind of proportion Mao favored.For Mao, a better political solution to the degeneration of the Party and governmentbureaucracy was to include more delegates directly from the ranks of the masses inthe new power organs. In fact, the Maoist leadership repeatedly stressed that the triplealliance, that is, the RC, was just a temporary political arrangement during the CR. Itwas by no means a fixed form of the new power organ. Among the three parties in thetriple combination, the role of the army was transitional. When the new power organbegan to fully function, the troops would withdraw from the civil power organ. In fact,after the Lin Biao Incident in 1971, the army representatives were pulled back to thebarracks.As for the representatives of the old veteran cadres, they would eventuallyfade outfrom thetriplecombination due to theinevitablebiological reasons-that isthat they would get old and eventually die. In due time, the representatives of the oldveterancadreswouldbereplacedby thecommon andyoungerPartyrepresentativespromoted from the rank-and-file people. At some point, with the withdrawing of thearmy from the triple combination, there would emerge a more stable power structurein which the representatives from the mass organizations and from the party competeandcooperate witheach other.At the same time,thiskind of more stablepower organwould still be under the leadership of the Party possibly for a long time. Therefore,

522thetriplecombinationwouldbechangedintoadoublecombination,namely,theLeftist representatives from the rebel mass organizations and the Party representatives.Or, the triple combination could change in a different way, where it is a combinationof representatives from the Party and the two rival mass factions: the conservative oneandtheradicalone.Withtheenhancementoftheclassconsciousnessoftherepresentatives from the mass organizations, the differences in status between theParty members and the non-Party members from the mass organizations could beeventually narrowed, and the Party's role in this kind of power structure could beprogressivelyreduced

Records showed that during the CR, in places that the pro-socialist andcommunist mass organizations exerted dominant influence such as in Shanghai, thedemocracy of the working people was greatly expanded and production developedcapidly.The history of the CR proved that the leftist mass organizations couldcompetently fight against revisionism and bureaucracy in the Party and the state.substantially dislodge the rightist elements, and ardently rekindle and continue therevolution. Therefore, I surmise that the new working people's power organ based onthe alliance of a communist party and numerous mass organizations can be a moreviable organizational form for asocialist society, which can be granduallytransformed into communism. Based on the practice of the mass organizations duringtheCR,the political arrangement in the future socialist societyshould include thefollowing aspects: any mass organization should be allowed, as long as it claims tosupport socialism and communism, and are willing to subject itself to the leadership

523ofthecommunistParty.Themassorganizationsshouldbetheadvocatesandguardiansofsocialismandcommunism.Theycanbeestablishedontheirowninitiative without notifying the Party in advance.Mass organizations should beencouraged to be established in all colleges, schools, factories, mines, governmentalagencies, urban districts and villages, among others, yet the scale and the scope ofoperation of the mass organizations has to be stipulated by the communist party. Thisis because the purpose of those mass organizations is to enable the masses to activelylearn and participate in politics, and to closely supervise the ruling revolutionary party- not to replace the party, as long as the party continues the revolution. The leaders ofthe mass organs should be democratically elected through voting by their ownmembers. Through due procedures, the mass organizations have the right to sendpolitical delegates to the power organ, which is led by the party, and they have everyright to propose that the party dispel pro-capitalist opportunist party members, orthose who are “Leftists in form but Rightists in essence". Unless the massorganizations degenerate into criminal groups, or if they wage armed struggles againstsocialism and communism, or against other mass organizations, the Party cannotdisband them. They should not be temporary, but permanent, as long as they do notdeclare to dissolve on their own initiatives. The mass organs have the right to besubsidized by the state, and the mass organizations, as the material vehicles of themass movements, have the right to go on strike and realize the Four Big Rights (sida)of speaking out freely, airing views freely, holding great debates, and writingbig-character posters. To ensure the semi-independence of the mass organs, it is not

524necessarytoset upparty committees to exerciseleadership withinthese organsFurthermore, the revolutionary party has the responsibility to admit new communistmembers from those mass organs. Meanwhile, every existing communist member hasthe right to join any mass organ. In sum, the party and the mass organs maintain adialecticaldynamicrelationship

Last but not the least, every mass organization has the right to organize anarmed militia, which should simultaneously be a military, labor, education and sportsunit. As long as the ruling communist party continues the revolution and serves thepeople, the armed mass organs can aid the party in defending socialism andcommunism, and helping the world revolution of the working people. Conversely, ifrevisionists control the party and betray the people's interests, transforming thesocialist means of production into the capitalist means of production, and the publicownership into the private ownership, then the armed mass organs can take up arms totopple this degenrated “communist" regime. This is why Mao said “to rebel againstreactionaries is justified", and advocated"going against the tide”(fan chaoliu)

Seen from these viewpoints, then, a major lesson of the CR is why afterrunningforawhile,almostallmassorganizationsweredisbandedafter theestablishment of the RCs. Due to the lockup and burning of the official documents ofthe CR by post-Mao regimes, unfortunately the specific reasons and the procedures ofdisbanding the mass organs remained unclear. From my research, the attitude of theMaoist leadership toward this issue might have undergone a gradual shift. Thedissolution of the mass organs was embodied in the Fold-up-flag (daoqi) Campaigr

525amidtheeffortstobringabouttherevolutionarygreat alliancestoformtheRCs.OnFebruary 1967 immediately after the January Storm, Mao proposed that the rebelsachieve“the great alliances”yet preserve the individual rebel organizations in order toconsolidate revolutionary gains. He said: "Right now the situation is very good andthe achievements are big. The whole state is progressing. When the situation is to theadvantage of the revolutionaries, the great alliances according to individual systems,departments and work-units should be pursued. Pay attention not to have therevolutionariesmergedintoconservativeforces.Don't bring about thegreat alliancesby disbanding organizations." In April 1967, when Mao was being briefed he wastold that the universities and colleges in Beijing had brought about the great alliancesand jointly formed the Congress of the Red Guards on the condition of disbanding theinitial three Red Guards'headquarters. Mao was very surprised and asked for theexact reasons for the dissolution of these three student headquarters.1° For quite along time, Mao's basic attitude toward the great alliances was to “make allianceswithout folding up the flags" (lianhe bu daoqi), namely, to forge great alliances butnot to dismantle the mass organs.As Premier Zhou Enlai expounded on November 91967,

It is not necessary to fold up the flags to bring about the great alliances,and to dissolve the organizations.After the great alliances there will benew issues. The great alliances do not mean to disband the

organizations. Only when conditions are ripe, could the organizations9Mao,Zedong, Guanyu shixing da lianhe de tanhua (Mao's Talk about the Fulfillment of Great Alliances),Cultural Revolution Database.2006.The Chinese Cultural RevolutionDatabase(CD-ROM).SongYongyi,edHong Kong: Universities Service Centre for China Studies, Chinese University of Hong Kong.10MaoZedong,Yumou tongzhi eyiduan duihua (AShortialogwith Comrade),April4,967,fromongLiveMaoZedong Thought(MaoZedong sixiang wansui),Vol.5,p.302,printed inWuhan,1967-1968.

526be dissolved. Unite organizations without abrogating the titles [of theoriginalorganizations].The great unification1[bydisbandingorganizations] does not work. It is necessary to have idiosyncrasies butnot to have an idiosyncrasy of "only I am revolutionary". We need bothpersonalities and commonalities. This is not factionalism. Factionalismmeans to exclude others and is a feature of the petti-bourgeoisie. Evenafter thegreat alliances,thetitles of thetwoconstituentfactions couldbe kept. The Military Control Committees (junguanhui) don't need topersuade them to fold up their own flags. This is just asking for trouble.As for whether or not to form a unified organization in the future, [itdepends on the conditions, and] let it be and let outcomes appearnaturally.!ll

FromZhou'stalkwecoulddiscernthattheMaoistleadershipdidnotfavordisbandingthemass organizations at least at theinitialstage of thegreat alliances.OnDecember10,1967,PremierZhouevenregretted thathedidnotpaymuchattentionto propagate Mao's initial directive of “*make alliances without folding up the flags"*.12ButthelocalMilitaryControl Committeeswhowerein chargeof formingthelocalRCs obviously had other thoughts. They usually pressed the mass organizations todisband after the formation of the great alliances. But eventually, because of thepersistent phenomena of bloody armed conflicts among different mass organizations,Zhou Enlai started to stress that it was merely a temporary measure not to dissolvesome organizations probably from the beginning of 1968.After the RCs based ontriple combination were formed, it was better to fold up the flags, that is, to disbandthe various mass organizations. To not dissolve these organizations at the time did notmean these organization would never be dissolved" But the Fold-up-flags Campaign11Zhou Enlai,Zhou Enlai jiejian ge tieluju canjia tiedaobuMaoZedong sixiang xuexiban daibiao shi de jianghua(Zhou Enlai'sSpeech to theRepresentatives from the National RailwaySystemMaoZedong Thought Study-class),in The Chinese Cultural Revolution Database (CD-ROM).

527encountered stubbornresistancefrom mass organizations,especially therebel factionsthat had fewer resources than their rival conservative mass organs. When the rebelslost organizational support, they would usually be ruthlessly defeated by theiradversaries. As a result, as late as September 1968, the Beijing RC suggested to theMaoist leadership that it was better not to use the slogan of “folding up the flags"Instead,theparlanceshouldbeshiftedto"overcomingsectarianism”and"scrapingthe mountains (xueping shantou) by opposing the mountainism (shantou zhuyi)."13 Inthe late days of 1968,most mass organizations were dismantled. On August 28, 1969.afterseveralarmedconflictsbetweenChineseandSoviettroopsintheborderareas,and China faced the looming possibility of a major war with the Soviet Union, theCCP CC ordered all mass organizations that were formed by two different trades bedisbanded and rendered illegal any newly formed mass organizations. Withoutpowerful support from the mass organizations, many rebel representatives in the localRCs were gradually and relative-easily dislodged by the military or Party authoritieson some pretext or other.14Even when rebel representatives were able to hold officein the RCs, they were usually assigned to the deputy positions and hence did not havemuch actual power. In later political movements, such as the Campaign of CriticizingLin Biao and Confucius in 1974 and the Campaign of Counterattacking theRight-deviation Wind to Reverse Verdicts between 1975 and 1976, many rebel leaders13 Zhonggong zhongyang zhongyang wenge pifa beijingshi geming weiyuanhui guanyu zhaokai gongren hejiefangjun Mao Zedong sixiang xuanchuandui fuzeren huiyi qingkuang baogao (Issued with instructions from theCCP CC and the CCRG: report by the Beijing Revolutionary Committee on the conferences with the leaders of the“Mao Zedong Thought worker propaganda teams"), September 6, 1968.

528hoped tolaunch a counteroffensive against the rightists in theParty and the army.Butthey did not have the support of the mass organizations.And unlike what happened in1966 and 1967 when they had the backing of the mass organ, they could not rally thebroadest masses. Although the rebel leaders did manage to make use of some officialorganizational forms such as theWorkers' Congress(gongaihui) to further theirinterests, compared with the early mass organizational form of fighting teams, thismode of mobilization, which mainly involved the core members from the former massorganizations was less efficient, and the participation of the broadest common peoplewas lacking.15 When the rightists staged a coup in 1976, the leftist rebels had noeffective way of swiftly organizing potent resistance partially due to the dissolution ofthe oncepowerfulmass organizations.

After the CR, Deng Xiaoping proclaimed that China would never launch massmovements again. Consequently, in the eyes of Deng, all mass organizations,whetherrebel or conservative,were wrong, even if many during the CR did defend his line(though not defending Deng himself), and fought against the Maoist rebels to thebitter end. But Deng making illegal of any independent mass organ turned out to befar-sightedforhis class.After1992,heurged theregime tolay off millions ofworkerswhohad experienced the CR and made great contributions to the national construction,of socialist China. When this happened, many former workers loyal to theLiu-Dengist line began to realize that it was a fatal mistakefor them tojoin theconservative mass organizations during the CR to fight for a world that would lay15See Chen,Yi'nan,Qingchunwuhen: yige zaofanpai gongren de shinianwenge Youth withoutTrace:A ebelWorkers'Ten-year CR), Chapter 25.

529them off.Theyswore that if they could go back to theCR,they would have definitelyjoined the Maoist rebels, not the loyalist of the Party of Order.1° Deng Xiaoping knewvery well that any former loyalist mass organs would not hesitate to rebel against hisregime if these workers knew the regime's hidden political agenda to fire them

In an article commemorating the 4Oth anniversary of the CR, the economistFred Engst summarized possible reasons behind the Maoist leadership ordering thatthe mass organizations be abolished. The reasons are as follows:

*Revolutionaries within the Party underestimated theimportance of independent mass organizations.

* The right to organize was granted by the Party, not earnedthroughstruggle

* Capitalist roaders within the Party vehemently opposed themass organizations for their ability to challenge the Party's authorityand their monopoly of power.

* Overwhelming resentment of Party officials toward massorganizations limited Mao's ability to carry out the Cultural Revolutionto the end, coupled with his failing health

* Ordinary people had not learned sufficiently how to exercisetheir socialist freedom of association in a responsible,peaceful meansthat also respected dissenting views. Their organizational immaturityundermined their effectiveness. Typically, one sees that the massorganizations were plagued with factionalism,intolerance of otherorganizations，quickness to criticize others，slowness of selfexamination,and personal rivalry that often resorted to violence.Chaos and disunity during that period made the movementunsustainable.

* Ultimately, it was Mao's reluctant retreat (under the threat ofacivilwarandtheresistanceoftheconservativeforcesinsideandoutside of the Party) to the idea of a centralized leadership of the party

(to the exclusion of other independent organizations) that terminated16 For one of such cases, seeDai Weidi, Wuhan"7.20" shijianji qita About the July 20 Incident inWuhan andOther Things), see http://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class14/200501/1205.html, cited on November 2, 2009.

530the experiment in independent mass organizations. 17

It is reasonableto say that the universal and overwhelming oppositionfromthe Party and army cadres toward the mass organizations,especially rebel factions,and the endless bloody factionalism among mass organizations could contribute mostto the downfall of mass organs during the CR. As a prominent leader, Mao could haveimportant influence on the historical process, but ultimately, it is the masses whocreatehistory.EvenMaowasunabletogobeyondhistimes.If therevolutionariesinthe Mao era did not fully understand the significance of mass organizations andpractice this organizational form well, Fred Engst urged revolutionaries to act better inthefuture with regard to mass organizations:

Onthe one hand,the future proletarianparties,after seizing statepower,should consciouslyput themselvesunder thesupervisionof themasses, viz. to consciously bring up relatively independent massorganizations,and totrain the working class's capability ofself-management;on the other hand,the broadest masses of theproletariatshouldlearntodifferentiatetwokindsofcontradictions,overcome the factionalism, respect different viewpoints, and ensure therights of other mass organizations.Only by this could the proletarianpower be consolidated in virtue of the proletarian extensive democracyand could the historical task of the proletariat be fulfilled.18

Fred Engst's suggestion is worthy of being experimented in the future socialistsocieties. Nevertheless, I have to reaffirm that any organizational form and anyinstitution - be it the Paris Commune, the Soviet, the Shanghai Commune, or the17 Engst, Fred (Yang Heping),“Mass Organizations and Socialism in China".

531RevolutionaryCommittees with the support of mass organizations,or others-cannotguarantee that societywill advance toward socialism and communism.As the statehas to be maintained possibly for quite a long time in the face of deadly bourgeoisintervention at home and abroad, it is dangerous to abolish the vanguard party, thesocialist army, and the bureaucracy as a whole. It would be equally risky to institute aParis Commune-style power organ largely in its original shape and configuration tooearly. The only way to advance to socialism and communism in a workers'state.while promoting world revolution abroad, is to put politics in command. As Mao putit, by “taking class struggle as the key link" (yi jieji douzheng wei gang), “we mustcombatselfishness and repudiaterevisionism"(yao dousi pixiu)

The Forgetting and Remembering of the Cultural Revolution

On October 6, 1976, less than one month after Mao Zedong's death, four keyrebel leaders, i.e. Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao, Jiang Qing, and Yao Wenyuan,were arrested in Beijing in a coup. Shortly after this event, three major leaders inShanghai, Ma Tianshui, Xu Jingxian and Wang Xiuzhen, were tricked into flying toBeijing to attend a fake “Central meeting". At this point, some Shanghai rebel leaderslearned from the broadcasts of foreign news agencies, such as the BBC and VOA, thatWang Hongwen et al had been apprehended. The night of October 12, the rebelleaders who were left in Shanghai convened a special meeting. During this meeting.they decided that if Ma Tianshui, Xu Jingxian and Wang Xiuzhen did not return to

532Shanghai the next day as Beijinghad promised, they would lead theShanghai militiato wage an armed uprising the next night. Ma Zhenlong, a standing committeemember of the Shanghai General Trade Union,which was the metabolism of thedisbanded WGH, contended that they should immediately revolt without waiting forMa, Xu and Wang. He was ready to sacrifice his life. Zhu Yongjia, a literati rebelleader and a standing committee member of the Shanghai RC, swore that if Shanghaitook the lead, then very soon, other provinces and cities would follow as well. If theuprising was suppressed and failed, Zhu averred, then, similar to the Paris Commune,history would remember their outstanding deeds. In this meeting, Zhu also announcedfour slogans that he had prepared for the uprising: “return our Jiang Qing", “returnour Chunqiao", "return our Hongwen", and “return our Wenyuan". Together withWang Zhichang, another intellectual leader, Zhu Yongjia urged the worker leaders tomobilize the Shanghai militia, and he promised that he and Xiao Mu, WangHongwen's secretary, would prepare the manifesto for the revolt. Once the militiatook thekey Shanghai positions before daybreak, they would announce the manifestoto the world. In the meeting, Zhu Yongjia also recounted the heroic story of theParisian Communards who fought to the end. Nevertheless, even though all theShanghai rebel leaders agreed to revolt, many of them wanted to know what reallyhappened before the planned revolt. They suggested that they should wait for severalmore hours to see whether or not their superiors Ma, Xu and Wang would return toShanghai on schedule at 11:00 o'clock the next day.1919Wang,Wenzheng, Qinli shenpan Zhang Chunqiao (My Experience of Trying Zhang Chunqiao), inMingrenZhuanji (Life of Celebrities),2006,No.2.pp.63-64;Gao,Ziru,Meng,Xian,Ershi shiji da shenpan (The Big Trails

533

As weknow,1976 did not see the rise of another Shanghai Commune. MaTianshui, Xu Jingxian and Wang Xiuzhen returned to Shanghai on schedule the nextday. But by then, all the major strategic positions were taken by the coup forces. Allrebel leaders were gradually imprisoned and sentenced by the post-Mao regimes.Among the rebel activists, Ma Zhenlong was sentenced to 16 years'imprisonment for“the crime of instigating armed revolt” and other crimes. When the judge deliveredhis verdict to Ma Zhenlong in a prison house, Ma refused to accept it. On the judge'sinsistence, Ma Zhenlong accepted but immediately threw the verdict out of theiron-barred window without reading a single word."° Zhu Yongjia, the eruditehistorian and literati rebel leader, who got no chance to announce the manifesto ofanother Shanghai Commune in 1976, was sentenced to 14 years’imprisonment fo1“'the crime of instigating armed revolt” and other crimes. Ma Tianshui was a highPartycadrerepresentativewhosupported therebels after theformation of theShanghai RC. He made a great contribution to the economic development of Shanghaiduring the CR and cooperated with the Hua Guofeng and Ye Jianying regime rightafter the coup in1976. But he was dismissed from the position of Shanghai partysecretary and arrested the next year. Due to harsh interrogation, Ma Tianshui becamementally deranged in 1978. In 1988, Ma Tianshui, a senior and outstandingcommunistwhohadbeena member of thepartyfor nearly50years,died alonein amadhouse. As for the four Maoist leaders apprehended in Beijing, Yao Wenyuan, anin the 20h Century),Shanxi luyou chubanshu,1993,pp.51-53; Ye,Yonglie,“Sirenbang xingwan"(The Rise andFall of the Gang of Four),Renmin ribao chuban she,2009,pp.488-493.20Wang,Wenzheng,ShenGuofan,Shenpan"sirenbang"Shanghai yudang (TheTrialof theFollwers of"Gangof Four"in Shanghai),in Bainianchao(A HundredYears'Tide),2008,No.1.

534ideologue, a member of CCP Politburo, and a major leader of the Shanghai Communeand Shanghai RC,was sentenced to 20 years'imprisonment. Yao died on December23,2005andwasburiedwithhiswife.In thecenter ofhis tombstone areinscribedtwo words: “Truth and True Feelings"(zhenli zhenqing). On the back of thetombstone, oneYao's poem,dedicated tohis wife, was carved.One line of the poemreads: “I will not change my mind." Zhang Chunqiao, the major leader of theShanghai Commune and the ensuing Shanghai RC, was sentenced to death with areprieve. During the entire period of the court trial, Zhang Chunqiao refused tocooperate by remaining silent. Zhang died April 21, 2005, shortly before his comradeYao Wenyuan in the same year. Wang Hongwen, a rebel worker leader and later thevice chairman of the CCP, was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1975, spreakingabout Deng Xiaoping re-assuming office in the Center, Wang claimed: “let's wait 10years and see." Wang might have thought that he could live longer than DengXiaoping as he was only 41 years old while Deng was 71 at that time.21 But onAugust 3,1992,Wang died injailfrom“seriousliver disease”at the age of 57,fiveyears before Deng Xiaoping's death. Jiang Qing, when she was tried in DengXiaoping's court, read out loud,“A Point of View of Mine"("Wode yidian kanfa")Shesaid:

Xiang Zhuang performed the sword dance as a cover for his attempt on

Liu Bang's life.' Those traitors will have their hold caught by the21Xu Qingquan, Deng Xiaoping wangbuliao de yiju hua (The Words Deng Xiaoping Never Forgot),in Shehuiguancha(ObservationofSociety),2005,No.10.Xiang Zhuang, an ancient general under Xiang Yu's command, pretended to perform a sword dance to entertainLiuBang but really in an attempt tokill him.Liu Bang managed to escape and later became the first emperor oftheWesternHanDynasty,ruling over China from 202BC to195BC.Here JiangQing stated that the trial of the

535people. The key issue is about the two programmes. The class struggleshould be taken as the key link. Once the key link is grasped,everything else falls into place [just like once you pull up the headropeof a fishing net, its meshes open], and we can continue the revolution.To take [Deng Xiaoping's] three directives as the key link is to take themeshes as headrope; it is a revisionist anti-party action.[Thoserevisionistsare]extremelyviciousandnowcompletelyreveal thetruecolors. In order to cover their crimes, they modified their appearance.To gain fame and authority, they [did not hesitate to] cheat the publicBy claiming to do things unorthodoxly, they spread fallacies to deceivepeople. They manufactured monstrous lies to cover the truth. Theyviciously perpetrated a gigantic fraud and maneuvered for some evilends.Theyforcefully confused one thing with another and furtivelygrafted one twig on to another. They stealthily shifted the misfortuneonto others in order to divert the people's attention. They unashamedlyblew their own trumpets in order to clear themselves of opprobrium.They framed cases against the CCRG. They persecuted and killedrelatedwitnessesandaccomplices.Thehandsof thoserevisionists,who throw straws against the wind, cannot cover all the ears and eyesof the people in the world. The motive force to make the world historyis the masses of the heroic people.23

Obviously, Jiang Qing did not think that she was a criminal, and she laid herhope on the masses. But by this time, her supporters could not publicly defend her,because millions of them suffered the same destiny as her, or even worse at the sametime. Outside Jiang Qing's trial in Deng's court, a large number of Maoist rebels wasjailed, executed, or forced to commit suicide. Moreover, there were still manycommon people whohatedJiang Qing,as the coup and post-coupregimes gave themofficial verdicts and documents that included the lie that Jiang Qing intended tomurder Mao Zedong, who they hypocritically referred to as the“greatest and reddestsun in people's hearts". Therefore, when it was said that Jiang Qing committedsuicide on May 14, 1991, there was not much of a reaction among the common peoplefourrebelleaderswasinfactthetrialofMaoZedong23Ye,Yonglie,“Sirenbang xingwan” (The Rise and Fall of the Gang of Four), Renmin ribao chuban she, 2009,p.1368.

536Even though the official statement of Jiang Qing's“suicide”was full ofinconsistencies and questionable “facts",24not manypeoplewanted tofind out thetruth regarding Jiang Qing’ mysterious death.

But things have greatly changed in recent years. The CR, and woman whofought at the forefront of CR, Jiang Qing, were invoked and remembered in thestruggles of the Chinese working people. For instance, on December 26, 2006, incommemoration of the 113'h anniversary of the birth of Mao Zedong, more than onethousand workers, disregarded the opposition from the government and held a rally atthe football field of the Chongqing Special Steel Factory in Chongqing city. Abovethe platform hung a big CR style poster of Mao that said “Let the Socialist NewCulture Occupy Every Stage". This was a famous CR slogan advocated by Jiang Qing.As these words usually came with Jiang Qing's pictures during the CR, the re-stagingof Jiang Qing's slogan in a workers' rally, though with Mao's picture, was actually ahomage publicly paid to her as well.

More significant thing related to Jiang Qing happened in the last days of 2009In a popular Chinese website zhonghuawang (http://www.china.com), there is avirtual memorial hall section(http://jidian.china.com) dedicated toseveralhundreddeceased people. Thesevarious halls were set up by the moderators of this websiteand the common netizens (wangmin) as well. The order of these virtual memorialhalls was based on the numbers of the virtual flowers offered by the netizens. Themore flowers the netizens offer to a deceased person, the higher status the deceased24 See Kuduo,Jiang Qing pingzhuan (A Critical Biography of Jiang Qing), Hong Kong: Yinghe chubanshe, 2005.

537person holds. The most popular memorial hall at the site was that of Mao Zedong.whoobtainedmorethan1.4millionflowersfromnetizensfromMarch30,2009tillFebruary 13, 2010." On November 16, 2009, in the virtual memorial hall section ofthis site, some people set up a Li Yunhe memory hall (Li Yunhe was the original nameof Jiang Qing). Since Jiang Qing had been demonized for more than 30 years as a"white-boned demon" (baigujing) by the mainstream media, Jiang Qing's name couldnot be used in the title of her memorial hall. Almost completely unexpectedly, a mere6 days later, Li Yunhe (Jiang Qing)'s memorial hall obtained more than 130,000flowers and more than eight thousand short elegiac addresses. The popularity of JiangQing was only second to Mao Zedong in the memorial hall section of this site, farbeyond other halls. Astonished by this, the administrators of the zhonghuawangpossibly on the direct demand of the regime, deleted Jiang Qing's memorial hall onNov. 23, 2009. This move from the authorities enraged the netizens who supportedJiangQing.As a result,thezhonghuawangwasincessantlybombardedbyprotestsand abuses. At the same time, some new memorial halls dedicated to Jiang Qing.under other names of Jiang, were stubbornly set up by netizens disregarding therepeated deletions. Take the Li Jin (another pseudonym for Jiang Qing) memorial hall.for instance. Just overnight, the rank of her memorial hall was promoted to the secondplace with more than 120,000 flowers. Again, unfortunately, this Li Jin memorial hallwas deleted. Then the netizens set up other new memorial halls of Jiang Qing agairand again. The deletion and reconstruction of Jiang Qing's memorial halls have been25 The site is htp:/jidian.china.com/usermemoral.jsp?urlcode=maozedong, cited on February 10, 2010.

538repeatedly and alternately staged for many days.Sometimes the administrators ofzhonghuawang would keep one or twoJiangQing's memorial halls for several daysbut in order to downplay Jiang Qing's popularity, the flowers and elegiac addressesdedicated toher werefrequently cleared away.Moreover, in order tolimit thenumbers of the flowers offered to her, zhonghuawang adjusted the script, andinstituted a new restriction that people can only offer one flower every three minutes.But all thesemeasures couldnoteradicatethelove andenthusiasmofthenetizenstoward Jiang Qing. The numbers of flowers offered to her have been continuouslyincreasing.26

Among the elegiac addresses, many of them were from young people, andquite a few middle-aged and old people, who expressed their deep remorse for notdefending Jiang Qing in 1976. In sharp contrast to the official propaganda, Jiang Qingwas seen by these netizens as the greatest heroine of the proletariat, the nationalmother of thePRC (guomu),and the mostbeautiful Chinesewoman.Many netizenseven directly called Jiang Qing mom in her memorial hall. After many days in whichtherewasaseesawbattlebetweenthecommonnetizens andtheadministratorsofthewebsite,possibly together with the Chinese regime behind the scene,JiangQing'smemorial hall was finally allowed to stand.?' At this point, including deleted flowers,Jiang Qing might have received more than one million flowers at the site. This was infact a major battle over Jiang Qing's reputation between the common netizens and the26 See http:/www.jiangqing.org/fils/v/e/bookoneonethreefour.html, cited on February 10, 2010.27The current address of Jiang Qing's memorial hall at Zhonghuawang site, under Li Jing's name, is:http://jidian.china.com/usermemorial.jsp?urlcode=jq , and a netzien set up a backup mirror site of it at:www.jiangqing.org,citedonFebruary10,2010.

539Chinese authorities. In this instance, in virtual space, Jiang Qing and her supportershavetriumphed.

Interestingly, Deng Xiaoping's memorial hall was also set up there. However,he only obtainedfourteen thousand flowersbetweenMarch31,2009 andFebruary132010.And some netizens have disclosured that these flowers were a sham.Theadministrators themselves intentionally added a large number of flowers toDengXiaoping by employing software—-because it was too awkward for the authorities tohave Deng Xiaoping get only a few flowers compared to Jiang Qing. But the biggestdifference between Deng Xiaoping's and Jiang Qing's memorial hall is not thenumbers of flowers they received. Rather, it is the content of the elegiac addresses. InDeng Xiaoping's memorial hall, more than 95% of the comments were negative andabusive. But in Jiang Qing's memorial hall, more than 95% of the comments werepositive and full of praise. Since the time it was first set up, Deng Xiaoping'smemorial hall has been repeatedly closed down because of too many curse words.Right now, the zhonghuawang administrators have to hire extra help to delete thecurse words in Deng Xiaoping's hall.?° Jiang Qing's memorial hall has beenrepeatedlyclosed down aswell.YetinsharpcontrasttoDeng'shall,JiangQingreceived far more flowers,and more importantly, she obtained mostly favorablecompliments. One elegiac address of Jiang Qing reads: "Rosy clouds/flow in thesky/the people's daughter Jiang Qing/ is coming back." In addition to Jiang Qing, at28 Deng Xiaoping's hallocates at htp://idian.china.com/usermemorial.jsp?urlcode=dengxiaoping At themoment of writing this story (on February 13, 2010), I find that even though Deng's hall is still there, the sectionof elegiac addresses in his hall is closed possibly due to too many protests and curse words. But in other people'shalls such as JiangQing,the sections of elegiac addresses arewide open.

540thevirtual cemeterysection of zhonghuawang,there arememorial hallsfor almost allthe major Maoist leaders during the CR, such as Zhang Chunqiao,Wang HongwenYao Wenyuan, Kang Sheng, Xie Fuzhi, Chen Yonggui, Qiao Guanhua, Hao Ran, etc.Every one of them has received strong support and a large number of flowers. It wasindeed one of the many ways by which the Chinese people were recounting thehistory of the CR other than the official version. If Jiang Qing were alive and couldsee this,she might have even more confidence to say that it was really the masses ofthe people, not the elite,who made world history.Farewell toRevolution vs.Continue the Revolution: The CommuneasanEternalReturn

With the passing of Mao Zedong and the rightist coup in 1976, China started alarge-scale campaign of de-revolutionization. At the early stage of this campaign, ittook a "revolutionary” form by employing traditional revolutionary parlance, and themain target was limited to the by-gone CR based on Mao's theory of the continuousrevolution. In a meeting with the Chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kohl in 1984Deng Xiaoping said: "We take the Reform as a kind of revolution, though it is not arevolution of the Cultural Revolution type."29 At this stage, even though the originalcontent and essence of the word“revolution"was discarded,to talk about29 Deng Xiaoping,"Women ba gaige dangzuo yizhong geming" We Should Regard the Reform as a Kindof Revolution,October 19,1984).Deng Xiaoping Wenxuan (Deng's Selected Works),vol.3,Beijing:Renminchubanshe,1993,pp.81-82.

541"revolution"was still politically correct. Yet in some sense,DengXiaoping's use of“‘revolution" to refer to the Reform was to the point, because indeed, post-Mao Chinaunderwent fundamental changes. For instance, several million of pro-CRrevolutionaries were persecuted,jailed and even executed. Tens of thousands ofwomen committed suicide everyyear for various reasons.After the CR for more than30 years, the life-span of the Chinese people improved very little, and according tosome studies, the life-span even reduced compared to that of Mao era. Everythingcould be sold: labor, land, water, mine, state sovereignty, women, children, blood,human organs, sex, emotion, and so forth. At the same time, all of these things werealso "polluted". This was a true Deng type “revolution". But soon, even the very word“revolution"was not desirable for the Chinese authorities and the elite due to its“"historical burden". In 1991, in face of the major shift in the Soviet Union and theEastern Bloc countries,Chinese officials and intellectuals convened a meeting inwhich they drafted an influential document titled “China's Pragmatic Response andStrategic Choice after the Radical Change of Soviet Union". In the documentsubmitted to the CCP, these elite people called the CCP to fulfill a major shift from“"revolutionary party” (geming dang) to “ruling party”(zhizheng dang), replacing anyremainingMarxismwith anationalistideology.30

In 1995, a self-claimed Marxist philosopher, Li Zehou, together with awell-known writer Liu Zaifu,published a book in Hong Kong titled Farewell toRevolution:LookingBackuponChinaoftheTwentiethCentury,biddingfarewell to30 Chen Lei, Pan Yue's Seven Keywords, se http://nv.people.com.cn/GB/1072/3637004.html cited on February10,2010.

542all the previous revolutions in the 2o"h century. In this book, they especially opposedthe theory of class struggle, dialectical materialism, the so-called worship of ideology,and Mao's proposition of "it is right to rebel."What they advocated was classcompromise, class cooperation, reformism etc. Li Zehou even condemned the Xinhairevolution, a Chinese bourgeois revolution in 1911.?1 The book has swept acrossChina. Yet it was by no means that Li Zehou and et al "invented" the theory ofbidding farewell to revolution; it was at best a theoretical summary of the previousde-revolutionized trend of thought aimed at rendering revolutions illegitimate.especially the kind of revolution that had been led by Mao Zedong. Eventually, thisthought became an official de-ideological ideology (qu yishi xingtai de yishi xingtai)and the CCP went from calling itself a “revolutionary party" to referring to itself as a"ruling party". In 2001, the Chinese president Jiang Zemin announced that the CCPhad transformed itself from a party thatled the people to strive for seizing state power,to a party that led the people to seize state power and ruled the country for a longtime.32 Therefore, the CCP's historical task was no longer to lead the proletariat tomake revolution toward socialism and communism, but to radically transform theChinesesociety toward semi-primitive capitalismin thename of“developing theeconomy". The CCP not only tried to maintain the actually existing capitalist order inChina, but also endeavored to help the capitalist world order survive in the currentcrisis of the worldwide financial breakdown. In order to justify the capitalist rule ofChina, the Chinese elite tried their best to rewrite history according to their worldview.31 Li Zehou, Liu Zaifu, Gaobie geming: huiwang ershishiji zhongguo (Farewellto Revolution: Looking Back uponChinaof theTwentiethCentury).HongKong:Tiandi.1995.32Jiang Zemin, Selected of Jiang Zemin Works,Vol.3,Renmin chubanshe, 2006,p.282.

543In 2006,aset of newhistorytextbooksfor high school students stressed“civilizations” while greatly reducing discussion of the history of war, revolution anddynasty shifts.With the exception of two cases, almost all peasant revolts in Chinesehistory were obliterated. As for world history, the French Revolution and the RussianOctober Revolution were erased from the history textbooks.3 In 2007, a famouspro-private capitalist liberal journal edited by some retired high Party and army cadresbased in Beijing,Yanhuang chunqiu (China Chronicle) reprinted a widely circulatedarticle on the internet. This article, titled“The Pattern of Democratic Socialism andChina's Future", written by Xie Tao, the former Deputy Principal of the People'sUniversity in Beijing, strongly opposed the so-called “violent socialism” allegedlyadopted by Lenin, Stalin and Mao. He claimed: “The relationship between socialismand capitalism is a relationship of continuation and development, and is not arelationship of overthrow and elimination.“This already proves the shining rise toprominence ofWesternEuropeandemocraticsocialism and the eclipse of theviolentsocialism of the former Soviet Union." 34 Xie Tao deemed that democratic socialism“"turns the socialist movement into a peaceful, rational evolutionary process,” and that"SocialDemocratshavesuccessfullycreatedinthedemocraticframeworkofthedeveloped capitalist countries a path for the peaceful transition to socialism",therefore, “the working class has no need to rise in revolution, and can be ^liberated33 Panduola,Lishijiaokeshu jiuheyang gaobie gemingma Do the HistoryTextbooksBid Farewel toRevolutioninSuchaWay?),fromhttp://www.globalview.cn/ReadNews.asp?NewsID=9678,cited onFebruary13,2010.34Xie Tao,Mingzhu shehui zhuyi moshi yu zhongguo de qiantu ("The Pattern of Democratic Socialism andChina’s Future"), in"Yan Huang Chun Qiu"(China Chronicle), February 2007.

The elite's effort to propagate the idea of "bidding farewell to revolution" hasindeed achieved tremendous success in many venues,but it has also encounteredfierce resistance among the netizens. For instance, the “revisionist”" Shanghaimiddle-school history textbooks have been widely criticized on the internet. When aneo-liberal historian Zhu Xueqing, who participated in the writing of the newShanghai history textbooks,defended the textbook in a popular website xinlang(Sina.com) and claimed that previous Chinese history books had been feeding thechildren with barbarian “wolf milk", he immediately came under overwhelmingattacks and abuses from netizens,resulting in the withdrawal of his rebuttal from thewebsite.37 Similarly, Xie Tao and Xin Ziling's opposition to the so-called “violentsocialism"and advocacy of“democratic socialism"has beenhitwith a barrage ofrebuttals.Severalhundredarticles,whichrefutedXieandXinanddefendedthe35 The digest of Xie Tao's viewpoints of this article can be found in Wu, Bing, Democratic Socialism Is Capitalism:A criticism of XieTao's"OnlyDemocratic Socialism Can Save China",seehttp://mike-servethepeople.blogspot.com/2007/05/democratic-socialism-is-capitalism-pt-1.html cited onFebruary10,2010.36 Serve the people,“Xie Tao ‘Adopted’ by Imperialists", seehttp://mike-servethepeople.blogspot.com/2007/06/xie-tao-adopted-by-imperialists.html, cited on February 10,2010.37Anonymous, Zhu Xueqing shi cuangai lishi jiaokeshu de zhuxiong (Zhu Xueqing is the Arch-criminal ofTampering the History Textbooks), see http://www.wg1976.net/read.php?tid=3868, cited on February 1, 2010.

545violent socialist revolution,appeared on the internet within a short period of time. Theresistancetothebiddingfarewelltorevolutiondidnotonlyhappenincyberspacebut has also come from the common workers, peasants, demobilized and transferredsoldiers and many intellectuals who have no access to the internet. In sharp contrast tothe authorities'and mainstreamelites'wishes,the masses who arein thebottom of thesocial hierarchy, have earnestly called for revolution. Roughly starting in 2001, everyyear, common people from many places, both in cities and in villages, began to holdrallies to commemorate the birth and death of Mao Zedong on September 9 andDecember 26 respectively. In 2008, the Chinese regime legalized the traditionalancestor worship festival“Tomb-sweeping Day"(qingming jie) in the hope ofpropagating Confucian ideas. But to its surprise and beyond its expectation, manypeople made use of this festival to commemorate the revolutionary martyrs and MaoZedong. This is really an example of the creative wisdom of the masses. Some ofthese rallies have been stormed by the police equipped with sleuthhounds andhelicopters, and some Maoists have even been arrested and sentenced to set terms ofimprisonment. Yet the scale of commemorations of Mao had been growing bigger andbigger in recent years. In 2006, regardless of the mass media's concentrated attack onthe CR and Mao, many places throughout China held praiseful commemorations ofthe4oh anniversaryof theCR

In the post coup era of de-revolutionization since 1976, even though quite afew conferences on the Paris Commune have been held in China, there has been alack of political gatherings in memory of it. In March 2008, for the first time after

5461976,a political gathering in memory of theParis Commune took place at theUniversity of Aeronautics and Astronautics in Beijing. On their own initiative ratherthan that of the Party, forty Communists Party members attended a commemoration ofthe 137th anniversary of the Paris Commune. Except for ten college students, mostparticipants were former Red Guards and retired high Party cadres. Their parents wereusually old revolutionaries, and they themselves graduated from elite schools, such asthe Yan'an Nursery School, the Yucai School, the August 1 School, and the No. 101Middle School, which were schools mainly for children of Party's cadres even datedback to the Yan'an era. This meeting reaffirmed the most important principles of theParis Commune: the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made statemachinery, and use it for its own purposes. That is, the proletariat should userevolutionary means to seize state power, smash the military bureaucratic machine ofthebourgeoisie, and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat to replace thedictatorship of thebourgeoisie. To ensure that administrators are not to transform intobureaucrats, all administrators should be elected by universal suffrage from thebottom up. They should be subjected to recall at any time and their salary should notexceed that of a working man. In this meeting, Professor Xu fei from theCommunicationUniversity of China tookMarx's Civil WarinFranceinhand andsaid that it was necessary to combine Marxist theory with practice, and that it wasimportant to understand Engels'*Introduction [to Karl Marx's the Civil War inFrance]". One of the key issues of the meeting was to defend the right to make violentrevolution and oppose the Chinese “democratic socialists". Professor Zuo Dapei from

547the ChineseAcademy ofSocialSciences,clearlydeclared:

The meanings and influences of the Paris commune to thecontemporary world, I would argue, are tremendous... And it haspractical meaning for current China. Originated from the EuropeanDemocratic Socialist Parties, democratic socialism centers on theproposition of peaceful transition and parliamentarism. This is a liethat was exposed by the[lessons of]the Pairs Commune.Underpressing conditions, rebellion is necessary. The difference in the ParisCommunefromWesterndemocracyisfundamental,astheformeristhepeople's congress while thelatter is the bourgeois congress.TheParis Commune is a democracy of the working class.I'd like toemphasizethattheCommunewasestablishedthroughdirectgeneralelection by the working people. Right now, while European socialdemocratic parties have bragged that they represent the working class.in the Chinese democratic socialist circle, no one stands up to speak forthe acting and laid-off workers and peasants.38

Professor Wu Chongguang, who taught Marxism at the University ofAeronautics and Astronautics in Beijing, stated.

Today's meeting is very meaningful, as it can deepen ourunderstandingof theideaofviolentrevolutioninMarxistthought....Democratic socialismin the nineteenth and twentiethcenturies put emphasis on developing into socialism by reformist andpeaceful ways. In the new century, however, Xie Tao and others focuson changing the social ownership of the means of production andpromotingprivateownership...Thelessons oftheParisCommunewarn us to be highly alert to democratic socialism.39

Pointing at the huge gap of earnings between officials, bosses and commonworkers, the attendees of this meeting called for returning to the Paris Communesystem of payment andMao's mass line.Aformer counselor at the Chineseembassy38 Chen,Ansheng,Hngse ernu jinian bali gongshe 137zhounian zuotanjiyao (A Summary of the Symposium inCommemoration of the137Anniversary of theParis Commune by the Red Daughters and Sons),seehttp://www.wengewang.com/read.php?tid=12518cited onFebruary10,2010.89Ibid.

548in the Soviet Union, Cheng Hai,who studied in the UsSR for many years, asserted:

In keeping with the principles of the Paris Commune, the salaries ofofficials cannot be higher than those of experienced workers, that is.6,00o francs.[But] according to the journal zhonghua hun (ChineseEthos), however, CEOs of our top eight banks receive an annual salaryof Y 9,ooo,ooo per person...These phenomena utterly violate theprinciples of the Paris Commune, and they are completely divorcedfrom the masses.... If we do not stick to the principles of the ParisCommune,noonewouldcometotherescuewhenthePartyand thecountry fall... Just as Su Tieshan says, if the Party does not talk aboutclass,thePartyloses thereason of existence.Now the attacks onMaoare as fierce as the Khrushchevian Soviet's attacks on Stalin...40

The most important issue was raised at this meeting by the former chairman ofthe All the Chinese Workers' Union, Han Xiya. He said that the principles of the ParisCommune were of utmost importance. “I have been dealing with workers’ affairs,” hesaid, “I believe that it should be the workers who run the country. A single partycannot run a country very well; workers can manage a country as well." Then how toensure the management of a country by workers? Zuo Dapei and Su Tieshan stressedat the meeting that all functionaries should be elected by virtue of universal suffrage.These points deserve to be reconsidered seriously. The key issues here are as follows:what is a feasible political system of workers' power organ in the future? Should it berun by the party, by workers themselves, or by the party and workers together? Inother words, what is the relationship between the party and the workers? Will thegeneral election after a socialist revolution suffice the consolidation of a socialistworkers? power? As we know, at least in the 2o"h century, socialist revolutions usually40Ibid.41Ibid.

549took place in the countries atthe periphery of the world capitalist order.While in thepost-revolutionsociety,theworkers always consistedof only a smallportion of thepopulation in those countries.The majority of the peoplewerepeasants,petti-bourgeoisie, and others, who were not imbued with proletarian thoughts. TakeChina as an example. In 1971, Chinese industrial workers accounted for no more than30 million as compared to a total population of seven hundred million. Six sevenths ofthe Chinese population were peasants. In response to this situation,Premier ZhouEnlai took the view that on the one hand,China was a socialist country that was basedon the worker-peasant alliance and the two systems of socialist ownership, viz. theownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Seen from this perspective.China applied a dictatorship by the majority (worker-peasant alliance) over theminority. On the other hand, since the numbers of the authentic proletarian workersaccounted for a small portion of the whole population, as well as within theworker-peasant alliance, there was not that much proletarian thinking. From thisperspective, China was a dictatorship by the minority (industrial workers) over themajority (peasants and other non-proletarian population).42 Under such circumstances,howcouldthecommunistadvocatesofuniversalsuffrageguaranteethatgeneralelections would not result in the restoration of the old capitalist order, that is,anon-socialiststate?

I believe that general elections are important. But just as Marx was critical ofthe fact that the Parisian workers organized the general election too early, the42ZhouEnlai zongli jejianHanDing yijia shi de tanhua jlu(PremieZhouEnlai'sTalkwiththeWilliamHinton'sFamilyMembers),according toWilliamHinton andYangHeping(Fred Engst)'s notes that day.Seehttp://www.wengewang.0rg/read.php?tid=15247,citedonFebruary10,2010.

550questions of when and to what extent to institute the“general election", and in whatways it can be guaranteed that the outcome of the“general election"will be good forthe socialist and communist cause, are equally important issues and worthy of seriousdiscussion. For example, after a successful socialist revolution led by a vanguardcommunist party, should the vanguard party completely transfer the state power to thecongress of the workers, peasants and soldiers that are elected by universal suffrage?Or should the vanguard communist party at least partially retain some key powerorgans, such as a small-scale standing army, the educational and cultural entities, thetreasury, and/or possibly others, and leave the rest of the power organs to the people'scongress based on universal suffrage? Should the post-revolution societyinstitutionalize an Election Court in the hands of communists to veto any non-socialistoutcome of the general elections?As weknow, Lenin and his Bolshevik Partydisenfranchised more than a few people after the October Revolution. Then, in thefuture revolution, what kinds of people should be deprived of voting right? And inwhat stage should every capable adult have his or her voting right? Is so-calleddemocracy a goal, or a means to an end? Or both? Mao once stated that “Those whodemandfreedom and democracy in the abstractregard democracy as an end and notas a means.Democracy as such sometimes seems to be an end,but it is in fact only ameans.43 The classical Marxist writers tended to believe that once one talks about‘pure" democracy and freedom, the political meaning of these words will be lost andsociety will become a non-political society. I think that as people consider general43 Mao Zedong, On the Corect Handling of Contradictions among the People, Peking Review, No. 26, June 23,1967.

551elections inkeepingwith theprinciples of theParis Commune as thekey tofuturerevolutionary society, the above issues should be discussed and further explored

Remarkably, many attendees at the meeting in commemoration of the 137thanniversary of theParis Commune had a negative evaluation of the CR. This maypossibly have been due to the family backgound of the high Party and armycadres.According to the news report of this meeting, none of them mentioned theShanghai Commune and the RCs. Chen Ansheng, a researcher from the Party Schoolof the CCP's Nuclear Industry, said that people should not negate the Chineserevolution just because of Mao Zedong's errors. Professor Wu Chongguang, asupporter of President Hu Jintao, warned that China should neither regress to the eraof the CR that preceded the Reform, nor should the country regress to the old Chinabefore 1949. It was equally significant that the banner hung in the meeting room read:"Master and carry out the spirits of CCP's 17th Congress and commemorate the 137thanniversary of the Paris Commune." Nonetheless, many other people disagreed withthe viewpoints about Mao and the CR at this commemoration.Some people evenaccused the attendees of this meeting of being a group of revisionist elements. In anarticleentitled“RedBlaze:InCommemorationof the137thanniversaryof theBirthof the Paris Commune", Qiushike, an influential internet writer, though not directlydebating with the attendees of the meeting, posited that rather than being gravemistakes, many practices before and during the CR were based on Mao's theory ofcontinuous revolution that inherited and developed the principles of theParisCommune. According to Qiushike's studies, first of all, Mao saw that true socialism

552must restrict bourgeois rights (faquan), which overran the Party, the government andthe army before the CR.Therefore,Mao incessantly proposed to reduce thefunctionaries' salaries and abolish the military ranking system, and restrict theprivileges of intellectuals. Mao even suggested that one should reduce the wage levelsamong the workers. Secondly, the masses should run the power organs directly, andhave the right to supervise, elect and dismiss the power holders. The "twoparticipations, one reformation, and triple combination", “four big rights", therectification campaigns, the dictatorship of the masses, and the mass movements wereconcrete manifestations of this kind of thinking. Thirdly, realizing the superstructure'sdecisivecounteractiveeffect ontheinfrastructure,Maocontinuouslycarriedoutreforms of the state system. The cadres' participation in productive labor, theestablishment of themilitia,thecultural,artistic and educational revolution,and theCR, were manifestations of the deepening of the proletarian dictatorship. Fourthly,Mao deeply understood thecounteractive effectof thesocial ideology.Thefinalvictory of communism would not simply depend on the change in the infrastructureand the superstructure. People's minds needed to be armed with a proletarianworldview and it was necessary to excise proletarian dictatorshipin the sphere ofideology. Therefore, Mao called for learning from Lei Feng, combating selfishnessand repudiating revisionism. Without this, the socialist revolution will ultimately bedefeated. Fifthly, Mao's thinking and the practice of smashing the old state machinery,compared to those of the Paris commune and October Revolution, were morethorough. Mao's thinking of exercising the all-round dictatorship of the proletariat in

553the spheres of the superstructure and ideology was what the Paris Commune andOctober Revolution had neglected -which is why this was of such far-reaching andcreativesignificance.In this way, Mao's CR was a major contribution to the theoryand practice of the world revolution.

Mao Zedong believed that even after ten thousand years, people would stillmake revolutions.*? And Lenin used to say that to prepare for the future, one alwaysbegan at the highest pitch previously reached.*° In some sense, regardless of itshistorical limitations and shortcomings, the CR can be seen as the highest pitch of thelast wave of the communist movement. Then,would people in the future still drawlessons from the CR, from the organizational creations of the Shanghai Commune andthe RCs that were largely in keeping with the principles of the Paris Commune? Isthere a possibility of reviving the Commune model in the Chinese and the worldrevolutionsinthefuture?Ontheonehand,thesearereallyquestionswithouteasyanswers,asnotevenweathermen can tell theexactshape of thecomingstorm.On theother hand, there is simplicity to the questions, as the coming storm, as a familiarstranger, is likely to come in a similar way.As a Chinese verse in the famous dramaChe Guevara directed byZhang Guangtian goes

As long as labor is not completely liberated from capital, as long as the bigdifferences between the privileged and the underprivileged are not largely leveled, theCommune could be an enduring point of reference and an eternal return for theworking people's emancipation. The Commune birthplaces, as Marx prognosticated,will be everywhere in this world.4847 Liu Zhifeng ed., Qie Gewala: fanxiang yu zhengming (Che Guevara: Responses and Controversies), Zhongguoshehui kexue chubanshe,2001.p.24.48MECW.Volume 22.p.540.

Postscript

It wasnot easyfor metochoose towrite a dissertation about theCR.To doresearch on the CR is a risky endeavor. For someone like me who has not personallyexperienced the CR, it is indeed a daunting task to merely piece together basichistorical facts, and the task is made more difficult due to the lockup and destructionof the CR materials by the post-Mao Chinese regime. More importantly, to study theCR in a light other than the official verdict and mainstream intellectual positionsmeans akind ofself-isolation andself-exilefrom theChineseintellectualelite.Beforesetting my mind to probe the shadowy history of the CR, to deeply learn about Macand the masses in socialist China, I have already come a long way. Even though in myrural hometown in Hu'nan Province of China, almost all peasant families still hungMao'sportrait in the center of the domestic altarin their houses,I had no specialfeelings for Mao. For a long time, in the Chinese textbooks I studied, Mao was said tohave achieved a great deal in creating the new China in 1949.However, he wasportrayed as having made grave mistakes, and even described as a criminal for havinglaunched the Great Leap Forward and the CR. During my undergraduate years inBeijing, many of my professors conveyed their hatred for Mao and the CR in theclasses I attended. If it had not been for Mao, the last power and blood thirsty emperorthey claimed, China would have been far richer, stronger and more "modern" and weChinese might have lived in a USA-style paradise by now. Their viewpoints, Ihave to

556admit,profoundlyinfluencedthewayIlookedattheworld.EventhoughIhadnevertotally negated Mao as many Chinese intellectuals did, I still remember when Iapplied for admission to American universities in 2000 to further my studies, I had aheated exchange with an American professor who later became a good friend of mineregarding Mao and the Cultural Revolution. I proclaimed to be the representative ofthe Chinese people and seriously “criticized" his sympathy for Mao and the CR and Iargued that he, as a foreigner, had less knowledge of the Mao era than the Chinesepeople. I told him that the Chinese people suffered tremendously from Mao'sinhumane social experiments, as my Chinese professors had repeatedly told me.

But during the past ten years due to several things my perspective hasdrastically changed. The most decisive factor was the chilling reality in China.especially in the rural areas, including my village. After I arrived in the USA, Icontinued to learn bad news from my family, my relatives and my neighbors in thevillage. I got so much bad news that sometimes I was afraid to make phone calls toChina. Most of the bad news was related to the migrant workers from my village. Forexample,mysecondelderbrotherhadcontractedcervicalvertebradiseasebecausehewasforcedtooverworkforbossesofprivatefactories.Isenthimmoneyformedicaltreatment, and suggested that he give up the hard work since he was no longer able todo hard manual labor. But he refused. The reason was obvious. He could not pay theeducational fees for his children if he stopped working in cities as a migrant worker.In today's China, due to the lack of medical service and parental care, many childrenwho are left in their rural homes, suffer from psychological disorders, because their

557parents have towork as migrant workers in cities. My brother's smart and diligentdaughter who once did very well academically in elementary school and used to beseen as the only hope for the family,unfortunately,now falls behind academicallysuffering from an obsessive compulsive disorder. Meanwhile, my sister has sufferedfrom serious mental trouble due to her working experience in cities. One disaster afteranother, in order to take care of her sick grandchild who wasleft behind by his parentsmy aging mother broke her hand one night. Without my remittances, she would haveno way to pay for the huge medical bill. In addition, my mother's younger sister diedin her early-fifties from cancer. Short of money, she had never had any physicalcheck-up before the terminal cancer. My mother's only brother, a skilled tailor in hisearly fifties, was diagnosed as having serious tuberculosis due to air pollution in thework environment and as a result of working 12-hour a day for his bosses. This kindof tragedy is by no means limited to my family. It is an epitome of our timeCompared to many other rural families' destinies, my family's misfortunes areactually less tragic.As a matter of fact, there have been numerous cases in my villageand neighboring villages where young peasants who went to cities as migrant workerswere shippedbackincineraryurns that contained their ashes.

As a matter of fact, the average life span of Chinese peasants has greatlydecreased under the post-Mao regime. In today's China, the Chinese peasants' averagelife span, is possibly around 60, 12 years shorter than that of the urban population.1 This data is from Zhao Zhongwei's disclosure at an international conference “Beijing Forum" in 2005 tocelebrate the coming of Beijing Olympics. See http://bjyouth.ynet.com/view.jsp?oid=6824932&pageno=1 , ZhaoZhongwei's research on this issue was reported in Xinjingbao (New Beijing Daily) on November 17, 2005. Alsosee Zhou Zhengcheng,Nongming weihe bi shimin shouming duan12 nian(Why Peasants'life is 12 Years'Shorterthan that of Citizens?),inXiaokang shenghuo(Well-OffLife),2005,No.12.

558Nevertheless,roughly at the closing of the Maoist era,the average life-span of theChinese population was age 69.? After about 30 years, the Chinese governmentclaimed that the average life-span was approximately 69 years, or even 72 years. Butaccording to a former Deputy Health Minister, Yin Dakui's disclosure, the average lifespan in China was only 68, and the average life span of the Chinese intellectuals wasevenless,at 58years.Roughly from 2000 to 2005,135 experts and professors in theChinese Academy of Sciences and Beijing University died at an average age of 53.5years.° Compared to the great improvements from 35 years in 1949 to 69 years in1980 in the average life-span of the Chinese population because of the socialistachievements during the Mao era (and the Maoist legacy from the closing of the CRyears to the early days of the Reform and Open-up era), the post Mao regime reallyhas nothing good to report in terms of the life span in China. However, the sufferingsof the Chinese people, especially so-called“disadvantaged social groups"(ruoshiqunti, such as peasants and workers),from the perspectives of the mainstream elites,are nothing other than the “necessary”cost of the seemingly permanent“Reform andOpeningup"policy.

SoIaskedmyself:whyisthat?Werethethingsthesamebeforeand after the2Yu Guanghan, the director of National Committe of Chinese Aging Issue stated that the average life span ofChinese population in 1980 is age 69. See Ji Xichen, Dajia lai guanxin laonianren wenti: fang zhongguo laolingwentiquanguoweiyuanhui(Let us Concern theAgingIssue:Aninterviewwith theNational Committee ofChinese AgingIssue),inRenmin ribao(People's Daily),July 29,1983.Accdong to another source,the maximallife-span of Chinesepopulation was age 69 in1982.SeeYuan Shouzhuang ed.,Shehui jingji tongjixuegaiyao(AnOutline of the Social Economic Statistics),Beijing: Zhongguo renmin daxue chubanshe,1987,p.278.Butaccording to numerous studies on the internet, as early as in 1976, the average life span of Chinese population wasage 69;and in order to depreciate theMaoist achievement on the life span issue and glorify theReform andOpen-up, the current regimes purposely falsify the statistics.See Cao Weiping, Jiechuan Deng Xiaoping zai renkoushouming shang de huangyan (Debunk Deng Xiaoping's Lie on the Issue of the Average Life-span), fromhttp://www.wengewang.org/read.php?tid=12532,citedinFebruary14,2010.3 See http://bjyouth.ynet.com/view.jsp?oid=6824932&pageno=1 , Yin Dakui's disclosure on this issue at aninternational conference“BeijingForum”in 2005was reported inXinjingbao(NewBeijing Daily)on November17,2005.

559so-called theReformera?HowdidChinaarriveatitscurrentstate?WhitherChina?These questions can not be easily answered from reading books publishedrecently—especiallybooks published in Chinawhich arefull of distortions whendiscussing the history and reality of the PRC. Fortunately, the internet provides a greatnumber of narratives and arguments about theMao and Reform era which run counterto the mainstream narratives in books, films, TVs, radios, and other media. From theinternet, I have learned and deepened my understanding of the current situation inChina.The online sources revealed a lot of information that the mainstream media didnot or refused to reveal. From the internet, I learned that in the post-Mao era, thebureaucracy expanded with overwhelming speed and scale. Today, the ratio ofofficials and ordinary people in China is 1 to 18.4 There is no cure, I believe, for theChinesebureaucracyinanestablishedsystem.TheReformerabeganintheeconomicsphere,i.e.from introducing the capitalist relations of production,which haseffectivelysuffocatedChinesesocialismandcommunismwhichwascharacterizedbyegalitarianism andextensivesocial welfares.And the Chinesecapitalistbureaucractswill by no means give up the economic, cultural, educational and political privilegesthey have acquired during the past 30 years. Nowadays, in China, due to capitalist andbureaucratic interventions, there are more than sixty million peasants who have losttheir lands, and over sixty million jobless workers and several dozen millions of4Ma Haoliang, Guanmin bili gaoda 1 bi 18, zhuanjia huyu yankong guanyuan pengzhang The Ratio of OfficialsAnd OrdinaryPeople Reaches1to18;Experts Call onStrictly Checking theExpansion of Officials),seehttp://the0ry.people.com.cn/GB/40764/64077/64080/4404600.html cited on March 23, 2009. In the 1950s duringthe time of Mao, the ratio of officials and ordinary people in China was 1: 600.

560prostitutes.?And the numbers of all the marginalized people are increasing every yearPoor people cannot afford the high tuition fees, housing, and healthcare. Many ofthem even do not have enough healthy food. It seems that China is sitting on the edgeof a volcano which is about to erupt. Against this backdrop, despite the fact that theChinesegovernment after the CR tried itsbest tosuppress,obliterate,and distort thememory of the CR, the growing social contradictions and brutal reality since theReform have made me and many other Chinese students turn to the repressed historiesoftheCR.

Even though there are still countless postings on the internet about the CR andMao that repeat the official propaganda of post-Mao regime, there are also manypostings clarifying the distortions of history, recalling the“good old days" of Mao'stime,and praising the socialist achievements under Mao.At first, given that I had seensofewpositive evaluations of theMaoera inbooks,newspapers,TV screens,and soforth, I was verypuzzled as to why there were so many Chinese people on thee-media supportingMaoand theCR.But themoreIlearned aboutMao's time,themore interested I became in the CR studies. Eventually, I became addicted to debatingwith other netizens in the virtual space. On numerous sleepless nights, I have learnedtremendously from the community of netizens (wangmin).In the Chineseinternetforums, chatrooms and blogspheres, battles of political positions are taking place5For thenumbers of landless peasants in China,seeChenYanhuiDaluliuqianwan nongaming shidi xianlu t(TheRoadmapofLosingLandsfortheSixtyMillionPeasantsinMainlandChina)athttp://www.wyzxsx.com/Article/Class17/200504/1873.html.WangShaoguanget alestimated thatbetween1996and 2000 there were 48,070,000 laid-off workers in China.

561everyminute.Exceptfor thedraconian censorshipimposed by theChinesegovernment's numerous faceless internet police, this is almost like the re-staging ofthe Maoist sida ("Four Big Rights") of the CR, that is, to speak out freely, to air viewsfreely, to hold great debates, and to write big-character posters in virtual space. Insome sense, it is not me who chose to take up the CR studies; it is the dire social andeconomic reality in China today that has compelled me to pursue this project

562AppendixA:BriefBiographiesoftheMajor CharactersRelated totheShanghai CommuneAn Wenjiang (1944-） was a student leader of the “Third Headquarters of ShanghaiRed Guards". On January 11, he led nearly 1,000 members of his faction to rush intoShanghai's Public Security Department and seize power.

573AppendixC: Chronology:FromMay 16,1966 toFebruary24,1967May 16, 1966 The “Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party ofChina on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution", often referred to as the “May 16Circular", was issued. But it was actually published one year after, on May 17, 1967in People's Daily. This document has usually been seen as what signaled the launch ofthe CR.May 25

Seven young instructors and staff persons of the Philosophy Departmentof Beijing University put up the first big-character poster during the CR, which washailed by Mao Zedong as “the declaration of the Chinese Paris commune of the sixtiesof the twentieth century. Its significance surpasses the Paris Commune."May 28  The CCRG was formed. Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao acted as deputydirectors,andYaoWenyuanwas amember.June1Mao personally ordered that the first big-character poster be broadcastnationwide.Early June  Power holders struggled against some mini-cadres in charge of publicsecurity in street and lane committees and some common policmen at local policestations.June 12Seven workers at the Shanghai No. 17 Textile Mill, led by Wang Hongwenputup a big-character poster titled“SeeThroughtheMake-ups of thePartyBranchtoGet the Truth Out"' in the factory, accusing the factory power holders of taking thecapitalistroad.

574June 19Zhang Heming, the vice-secretary of the party branch at the Shanghai No17 Textile Mill, broke into and rummaged through the Security Section where WangHongwen and his two comrades were composing big-character posters.
