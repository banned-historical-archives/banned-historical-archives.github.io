# Some issues to pay attention to in propaganda reporting

Leading central-level comrades recently spoke to a few comrades from central-level news units about some issues one should pay attention to in propaganda reporting. Excerpts are summarized as follows:

1. How to report on (natural) disasters

China is a large country. It is difficult to avoid disasters happening every year. There are large disasters; there will be even more medium-size disasters and small disasters. It is not that one can not report information on disaster conditions, but one should pick out the important aspects -- general issues can not be reported. Reports should choose their words with great care, adopting a prudent approach. Socialism and capitalism are different; capitalist societies like reporting on strange and peculiar things, drawing readers--we don't go for that. Information on major disasters may be reported once it has been reviewed, but reporting too much will, objectively speaking, give people an unbelievable impression of disaster surrounding them from all angles. The main aspect is to propagate the struggle to contain disasters, the purpose of which is to make people feel there is a way out, to give them confidence.

Next, one must definitely verify details very well when reporting on disasters. For example, when reporting damage from floods, one must see whether or not crops were actually inundated and destroyed by water and mud. Or is it only that they will soak under water for a couple of days and then be restored? Or was it that seedlings were washed away but that compensatory sowing can be carried out? Reporters and editors must have knowledge and life experience in this respect.

2. How to report on weather conditions

Our awareness today of nature’s capacities remains low; still less can we say that nature has been controlled or restrained. There, reports on weather forecasts should be prudent, and long-term projections even more prudent; though meteorological departments should give reports, news units should not propagate them too heavily. For example, as soon as one reports that there may be a great deal of rain in autumn, society will produce all sorts of rumors, water management departments will have to make large investments, and so on, with other chain reactions. Yet it is still very difficult to say whether there will actually be any major rains. These kinds of predictions can be issued internally for circulation; bringing them to the awareness of the leadership is enough.

3. Reports on agricultural harvesting

This topic has bee discussed a lot, and there has been progress. Since agriculture is not yet up to par, harvest forecasts over the past few years have typically been comparably pessimistic, yet there have only been bumper harvests these past few years. There was also a rumor in April this year, that production would decrease; judging from the current situation, most parts will possibly see the same levels or a slight reduction. Central decisions have considerable bearing on the size of grain output. One must definitely make this very clear. The forecast says that production in Shandong will decrease this year, but one must also be analytical. If per capita production decreases, and there is apprehension over not being able to buy, then the masses will perhaps conceal more. In addition, one must also take into account that Shandong's crop variety is growing; even though grain production is a bit lower, overall agricultural production is high. This is particularly evident in northwestern Shandong.

4. Adopt a high sense of responsibility in handling problems with cadres

One must absolutely not make mistakes in handling problems with cadres; maintain a high sense of responsibility and adopt a fully democratic attitude. Leading comrades must absolutely grasp this problem, resisting "leftism" but also resisting "rightism". Cadre work must be centered on praise. A high sense of responsibility is also needed when deciding on praise, verifying facts clearly.

5. Propaganda work must be stirring

Do more propaganda on the advanced experiences of advanced collectives and advanced personalities, including new construction projects, new faces of the motherland, new customs among the masses, etc., etc. Television stations can treat this as their main propaganda subject--only this will the hearts of the people be inspired.

Report shortcomings and error, bad people and bad events; the battle against economic crime must also and definitely be given a forceful voice. But overall, more than 70 percent of the space for editorial material should be used for achievements, allowing people to see that we are unquestionably focusing on change, that the future unquestionably holds a large amount of hope.

I can see that Chongqing has changed a good deal, that Xiangfan has also developed very fast, that Automobile Factory No. 2 has been built very well, and that Gezhouba really is a great project of modernization. Circumstances described by all parts are all part of a very positive trend. It would seem that the production responsibility system is still far from achieving its full potential, proceeding with great vitality. Cadres typically report that the Center and the masses now have the same concerns at heart.

Broadcasting and television work are very easily affected by capitalism--pay absolute attention to this. Our news propaganda must serve socialism, and serve the Four Modernizations. Praise is carried out to this end; disclosures are also made to this end.

6. Walk on breathing new and fresh air

If one wants to raise the level of thinking, theory and policy, and maintain political uniformity with the Center, the main thing is to step down among the grassroots. If you only speak of grand morals, some people will not be convinced; if you step down among the grassroots and then proceed, you will convince. One should call on cadres at all levels, on all parties and all groups (pai), and on people in all trades and all sectors to step down among the grassroots. The territory of China is vast; having a few tens of thousands of people step down among the grassroots will be no catastrophe.

If one wants to alter thinking and improve oneself, one must also step down among the grassroots. If you sit at home, you won't see the road ahead; if you step down among the grassroots, you will see splendid light, and you will gain confidence.People who leave China henceforth must first understand China; if they go out and have a look at foreign countries without understanding China, the more they see the more they will feel that China isn't any good. Stepping down among the grassroots more can broaden thinking, improving your skills. Historical literary personalities like Sima Qian, Li Bai, Du Fu, Lu You and others– if they had not traveled over fully half of China, they would never have been able to write so many good things.
