Supplementary Explanations on Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee

On April 2, Comrade Wang Zemin presided over a meeting of the Provincial Party Committee’s Leading Small Group for Handling Petition Issues. The meeting conducted research on the implementation of Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee in all regions. The Leading Small Group believed that after Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee was issued, the response in all regions in the trial implementation was good. [The Leading Small Group] believed that it was in line with the spirit of a series of documents of the central government, in accordance with the real situation in our province, and played a positive role in solving lingering historical issues, stabilizing the situation and promoting stability and unity in our province; After several months of trial implementation, it has been proven that Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee basically is a good document. The Leading Small Group believed that, there will be no changes in principle except for certain clauses requiring some supplementary explanations. All regions are requested to take this document as a reference when handling petition issues.

The supplementary explanations for several issues that have been reported by all regions during the trial implementation are as follows: First, regarding the problem of handling misclassified landlords and rich peasants from before the Socialist Education Movement. In accordance with the spirit of the Center’s relevant regulations and documents, there is no need to review and re-examine all the old historical cases. Complaints filed by individuals, which need to be reviewed and handled, should all be put to trial in accordance with the principle of dealing with individual issues individually. If it truly is a mistaken case, it can be corrected with reference to the spirit of Article One of Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee.

Second. Issues concerning the scope and targets of remediated procedures for sent-down youth, as well as towns not on the “Up to the Mountains, Down to the Countryside Movement (UMDC)” list, [and] whether the procedures for sent-down youth should be remediated.

[We] agree with the opinions of the Provincial Office of Sent-Down Youth, which namely are:

(1) The scope and targets for remediated procedures for sent-down youth should be strictly limited to youth implicated in an unjust, false, or mistaken case that arose during the Cultural Revolution and [who were] therefore sent down to the countryside; those who exceed this boundary shall not be included in the scope and targets of the remediated procedures for sent-down youth. (2) For [the sent-down youth] returning to a city that is included in the scope of the “Up to the Mountains, Down to the Countryside Movement,” their immediate family members who meet the requirements for “Up to the Mountains, Down to the Countryside Movement” can take the reversed verdict and go to the Office of Sent-Down Youth in the city where they were mobilized and the county where they were resettled to go through the procedures for the sent-down youth. For [those sent-down youth] returning to a town that is not included in the scope of the “Up to the Mountains, Down to the Countryside Movement,” their immediate family members [are to] no longer go through the formalities for sent-down youth in the countryside, and [they] can accompany their relatives to move back to the town and settle their hukou there. (3) Without exception no further funds are to be allocated to anyone going through the remediated procedures for sent-down youth.

Third. Regarding the issue of providing relief for old employees who are experiencing livelihood difficulties after being discharged during efforts to reduce payrolls.

On this issue, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has already issued Document [1980] No. 11. The document mentions that, considering the state’s current financial and economic situation, the scope of beneficiaries of subsidies should not be expanded. The relief for old employees who are experiencing livelihood difficulties after being discharged during efforts to reduce payrolls should still be implemented in accordance with the regulations of the State Council’s Document Guoneizi No. 224, 1965, that is: that those [workers] who at that time were eligible to enjoy 40% of their original standard salary as relief but had not gone through the retirement and relief procedures, can go through the remediated procedures; their relief fund will be issued from the date of approval. For those who at that time were not eligible but now meet the requirements because their physical conditions have changed, [they] cannot go through the remediated procedures. For those who have livelihood difficulties, social relief can be allocated according to the living conditions of the local populace.

Fourth. Regarding the issue of money from confiscated property used for buying production materials or squandered through eating and drinking, and dealing with torn-down personal houses that have been confiscated or taken over.

According to the spirit of the Central document, the Leading Small Group believes that Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee should still be implemented.

In regions where private house renovation work was carried out late, one more serious review should be conducted in accordance with all private house renovation policies at that time. Occupied houses that do not conform to the private house renovation policies should be returned to the owners.

Fifth. Regarding the issue of hardship subsidies after the reversal of unjust, false or mistaken cases, one should insist on implementing the principle of “to seek truth from facts.” Those with real hardships should be given subsidies within the prescribed range of Document [1979] No. 82 issued by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and those without difficulties should not be subsidized. Do not [apply the principle of] “one size fits all.”
