# Notice on the establishment and perfecting of party organizations in the editorial offices of periodicals

Propaganda Departments and Organization Departments under all province, autonomous area and major municipality party committees; the Propaganda Department and Organization Department under the General Staff; Party Committees and Party organizations at all units in the central-level Propaganda system:

The amount of openly distributed periodicals of all kinds and at all levels throughout the country is currently very large. These publications command several hundreds of millions of readers, assuming responsibility for the major task of instilling communist thinking, propagating the Party line and policy, disseminating scientific cultural knowledge and enriching and raising the people’s spiritual confines. In order to give even better play to publications’ use in building socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization, Party leadership of publications must urgently be strengthened. On the issue of establishing and perfecting party organizations in the editorial offices of philosophy and social science publications, including arts and culture publications, the following is given notice of:

1. Editorial offices of all these kinds of publications that already have party member cadres must immediately establish and perfect party small groups under the leadership of respective superior-level party organizations; offices that do not have party member cadres or whose amount of Party members is insufficient or can not be called an organization must within a short period of time receive party member cadres with strong party discipline and a definite editorial work abilities, dispatched by superior-level party organizations to strengthen work, and immediately establishing party organizations.

2. Clarify the leadership connection between party organizations at publications’ editorial offices and superior-level party organizations in the same departments and areas. Party organizations at publications’ editorial offices must submit a report requesting instructions to superior-level party organizations within a set period of time. Superior-level party organizations must carry out inspections and supervision, listening to the instruction reports and providing direction, setting a time limit for discussing the work of publications, referring to the specified aims of the publications, editorial departments’ policies, editorial planning and other major issues that apply to publications’ leanings, also having leading cadres assume the main responsibility for publications regulation work.

3. The main task of superior-level party organizations and party organizations in publications’ editorial offices is, having undergone ideological political work and taken necessary organizational measures, to safeguard that publications are in line with the political direction upheld by the Center, maintaining the unity all personnel at editorial offices with the broader body of readers and writers, fervently raising the ideological content, scientific qualities and artistic and cultural level of publications. Any opinions that are not in line with the Center politically may be retained on the precondition of resolutely implementing Central decisions; one may report or explain these to superior levels, but one may not openly issue them in periodicals.

4. Establishing and perfecting party organizations in publications’ editorial offices is an important measure in rectifying publications; we must currently grasp this item of work. When carrying out this item of work, Propaganda Departments and Organization Departments under Party committees in all parts at all levels must at the same time one round of system-wide inspections and studies of the publication aims, editorial policies and editorial office staff at all publications under their respective jurisdictions, also solving existing problems. In addition to the necessity of establishing and perfecting party organizations at editorial offices as a means to improving work at publications, those whose publication has been suspended and those that have been merged must also be considered from all possible angles and have arrangements made.

5. In principle, the spirit of this circular is to be applied to all kinds of publicly issued newspapers at all levels, in addition to internal publications with relatively broad distribution and natural sciences (periodicals?).

We ask Propaganda Departments and Organization Departments under all province, autonomous area and major municipality party committees to report their progress in implementing this circular to the Central Propaganda Department and Central Organization Department before the end of December this year.
