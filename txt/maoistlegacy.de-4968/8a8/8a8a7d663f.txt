# Opinion on Some Policy Issues Related to Handling and Reviewing Cases

Beginning this year, there has been a sharp increase in the number of cases where people have been petitioning for an appeal; appeals to retract labels and appeals to be released from re-education through labor have been particularly prominent. In order to reach a common understanding and a common policy, to be successful in our work to review and reverse cases in accordance with the principle of seeking truth from facts, to stay in line with the relevant policy decisions issued by the Party Center, the State Council, the Ministry of Public Security and the provincial committees, and to apply these in the light of actual circumstances, we present the following opinion that addresses some policy issues related to the review and handling of appeals. All units are requested to consult and to implement this opinion. If any problems are encountered in the process of its implementation, these should be reported immediately for further consideration.

The fundamental principle when reviewing appeals is: Any case that can be categorized as unjust, false, or mistaken – no matter at what time it originated – must be revised. Any case that has gone through a review where the initial assessment of the case was based on assumptions that were fundamentally true and where the judgment was fundamentally correct – and as long as it did not confuse the two types of contradictions – does generally not need to be handled again. The specific opinion is as follows:

I. Concerning appeals requesting release from re-education through labor: These cases must be reviewed in accordance with the “State Council Decision on the Question of Re-education Through Labor” of August 1, 1957, and they must be in line with the Eleventh National Public Security Conference “Supplementary Regulations on Ten Specific Policies for Current Public Security Work,” approved by the Center on April 20, 1961, as well as the two documents issued by the party group of the Ministry of Public Security during the Fourteenth National Security Conference, and in accordance with the principle of seeking truth from facts. Whenever one of the circumstances listed below is present, then it is a mistaken case and the original decision in favor of re-education through labor must be revoked.

1. The principal facts of the offense for which the person was originally sent to re-education through labor have been essentially refuted.

2. The case has been incorrectly designated and improperly settled.

II. Some policy issues related to dealing with appeals on labeling

1. If a person has not been condemned as a counterrevolutionary in any previous political campaign and no new historical crimes or proof of new offenses are discovered, then the counterrevolutionary label must be removed.

2. Someone who was labeled as an industrialist-merchant cum landlord during land reform and who later on was once again labeled as a landlord and handed over for reform under surveillance by the masses or sent to the countryside should be dealt with in the spirit of Provincial Committee Document (79) No. 14 .

3. A law-breaking element within the people who has been punished as a criminal or sent to re-education through labor for negligence, for traffic accidents, for being responsible for an accident, or for crimes like minor embezzlement, gambling, theft and so on, should not be labeled a reactionary or bad element. If such a label has been applied, it must be revised.

4. In all cases where someone has been labeled as a Four Types element without authorization and without the approval of an organ with legal authority, thus resulting in an incorrect designation, all these [verdicts] are to be nullified. Among these, those who were handed over for reform under surveillance by the masses by public security organs must have [their labels] examined and revised by public security departments. Those who [were assigned to] reform under surveillance independently of public security organs are to have [their labels] reviewed and revised by their work unit.

As for cases where the designation is correct, but where the procedures for determining the label have not been ideal: as long as the requirements for removing the label are met, one can undertake preparations to remove the label. If the requirements to remove the label are not met, reform under surveillance by the masses must continue, and additional legal procedures should follow.

5. Those who were originally determined to be Four Types elements by a judicial organ, who after completion of sentence, discontinuation of control, or release from re-education through labor have been subjected to reform under surveillance by the masses in order to be reformed, must still be treated according to their label, not as having been reformed.

6. Those who were designated as common counterrevolutionaries during the Campaign to Eliminate Counterrevolution, who later displayed bad behavior [and therefore] were placed under surveillance by the masses with the approval of a judicial organ must not be granted a revision [if] they do not qualify as mistakenly labeled. However, if the review shows that the basic foundation for the original designation and handling of the case did not correspond with reality, revision must be granted.

7. Those who were designated as counterrevolutionaries and bad elements during the Campaign to Eliminate Counterrevolution and who were later publicly assigned a label and handed over for reform under surveillance by the masses with the approval of a judicial organ are generally not to have [their label] revised. In individual cases where the label is not suitable it can be revised.

III. Some issues when dealing with appeals from strongly suspicious elements

When it comes to strongly suspicious elements who, after being detained and investigated without sufficient proof for a verdict, are still impossible to clear of suspicion, their cases cannot be treated as unjust cases and they are not subject for reversal or revision, even though they have already been released. If it is possible to resolve the case and it can be established that it had nothing to do with the person in question or if the investigation gives enough evidence to be able to clear the suspect, it is necessary to reconsider the final decision for reversal or revision in line with the principle of seeking truth from facts.

Attachment: Some policy and reference material on how to deal with appeals (Excerpt)

## Some Policy and Reference Material on How to Deal with Appeals (Excerpt)

1. Among the suggestions presented by the Shanxi Provincial Public Security Office report, approved by the Ministry of Public Security on September 4, 1965, on how to handle the reversal for those who have been designated as bad elements, it is stated: “(1) Anyone who has been designated as a counterrevolutionary or any other type of bad element during the Campaign to Eliminate Counterrevolution, but who was exempted both from criminal punishment or [other] punishment, must be considered as having a label. (2) Anyone who was neither designated as a counterrevolutionary nor counted among the five percent during the Campaign to Eliminate Counterrevolution is not to be treated as having a counterrevolutionary label.”

2. While listing the essentials of public security work in 1964, the Ministry of Public Security stressed that: “Law-breaking elements within the people should not be labeled as counterrevolutionaries or bad elements; this must be clearly explained upon release after the completion of the sentence.”

3. In the report “Suggestions from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau on How to Implement Central Document (1979) No. 5,” appearing in the Ministry of Public Security publication Public Security Work Bulletin No. 11, 1979, it is stated: “Law-breaking element within the people who have been criminally convicted or have been sent to re-education through labor because of negligence, bigamy, traffic accidents, for being responsible for an accident, or for minor offenses like small-scale embezzlement or theft, and have for this reason been given a label, are to be granted revision.”

4. In the report “How Suqian County Solved a Few Concrete Policy Issues Encountered When Removing the Labels of Four Types Elements,” published in the Ministry of Public Security's Public Security Work Bulletin No. 15, 1979, it is stated: “Due to the fact that our earlier socialist legal system was imperfect, and because of archival disruption, disorder, and fragmentation caused by the Great Cultural Revolution, it is in many cases very difficult to ascertain if the legal procedures were in fact respected when labeling someone as a Four Types element. Faced with this problem, the principle of seeking truth from facts must be upheld. If the label was chosen without error, preparations to remove the label should be undertaken. However, all cases where errors were indeed committed when assigning a label must be redressed.”

5. In the document “A Few Problems While Struggling Against the Enemy during the Socialist Education Movement in the Countryside,” approved by the Thirteenth Public Security Conference, it is stated: “When Four Types elements are released upon completion of their punishment, are relieved from official surveillance, or return from re-education through labor, it remains unclear for a considerable amount of people whether they still have a label or not. For this category of people, the political status should generally be maintained. Those among them who have indeed reformed themselves can be rehabilitated in accordance with the law, but those who commit acts of sabotage can once again receive a label as stated by the law. Henceforth, the question of whether or not Four Types elements – who have been released upon completed punishment, have been relieved from official surveillance, or have returned from re-education through labor – can have their label removed is to be considered with the suggestions offered by the original labor reform unit or labor education unit to the local public security organs in mind. Those who have indeed been reformed can have their label removed; those of average conduct are to be placed under temporary observation by the local public security organs and can – after it has been discussed and approved by the masses – have their label removed; the ones with a bad conduct are not to have their label removed.”

6. In “Some Policy Regulations on How to Treat Counterrevolutionaries and Other Bad Elements as well as Some Investigation Objects from the Elimination of Counterrevolution [Campaign] ” from the Ten Person Central Committee Small Group it is stated: “Anyone who was investigated during the Campaign to Eliminate Counterrevolution but who had provided intelligence prior to the movement, or who was originally designated as a common counterrevolutionary or reactionary element but due to relaxation in policy was not punished as a counterrevolutionary, or nationalist soldiers whose earlier counterrevolutionary acts were pardoned upon defecting to the revolutionary side but who were later designated as rightist in the rectification campaign, ought to have been punished in the same manner as counterrevolutionaries or other bad elements. Even though there is not sufficient reason to label these people as rightists, they can, if their conduct is bad, be placed within production work and thereby their progress towards being reformed can be supervised in the workplace.”
