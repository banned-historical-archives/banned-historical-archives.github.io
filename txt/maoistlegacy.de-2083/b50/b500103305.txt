# The process of dealing with a critical text

Editor's note:

This piece was originally carried in an internal Xinhua News Agency publication. It recounts the handling of a critical article. The criticism contained in the text is of great interest. Over a period of just over one month, and despite running into all kinds of obstacles, the reporter still persisted in verifying facts with factories and relevant superior units and departments that had been criticized, soliciting opinions. The reporter took urgent account to help others, clarifying matters and also upholding principles, not fearing problems or shying away from difficulties, taking independent authority and issuing this article. This is an example of an accurately critical report and can be relayed to all news units for reference.

According to reports from an internal Xinhua News Agency publication: A reporter at the Beijing branch has written a letter describing the process of dealing with a critical text, the main contents of which are summarized as follows:

The text "Should she be punished or not?" (original editor's comment: This text is about Beijing Food Products Mechanical Repair Factory technician Chen Xiu, who was accused by the factory leadership of disclosing confidential material on new technology for inviting technical exchange personnel to visit the instant noodles production line, and thereby punished by having her position as assistant head of technical supervision services revoked, her status as technician changed, half a year's bonuses deducted and an upward adjustment of her wages reclassified as closed for consideration) has been reported for review; the process [of handling it] has been complicated. On December 10 last year, we handed this text to the Party cell at the Food Products Mechanical Repair Factory for review and approval, asking them to express their opinions. Ten and some days later, the factory had not replied, and had not returned the text either. We turned to them urgently, and the secretary of the factory Party cell said, "Our factory's Party cell does not handle external matters; the text has been sent to the head factory. Why don't you get in touch with the head factory?"

We then went on to contact the head factory. The director of the head factory's General Office said, "The factory has by no means sent us that text, but we have seen the text, and the opinion of the secretary of our factory's party committee is that it would be best not to publish the text, so as to preserve the morale of cadres. We suggested that the text be returned in any event, and that opinions also be voiced with regard to the text's wording and conformity with facts, and whether or not it should be published.

After a period of time, the text was returned from the food products head factory. Even though four opinions were expressed, no concrete suggestions were made. The first opinion said that the Mechanical Repairs Factory "had already acknowledged that the punishment of comrade Chen Xiu was incorrect." We believe that if the leadership of that factory had already truly acknowledged the mistake, then they should have considered whether or not the text should be published; if it should have been published, a clarification would have been necessary. We again consulted with the leadership of the head factory. The director of the head factory's General Office replied, "The leadership of the head factory has criticized the factory's Party cell; if they haven't said anything, then that's also a way of accepting criticism, a recognition of error." We again asked whether the factory's leadership had clarified that the punishment was wrong within the (time) frame specified in the originally declared punishment of Chen Xiu. The answer was: "I will honestly tell you that the thinking of that factory's leadership is deeply irregular. The reason that we are replying to your letter is that we hope the text will not be published – please consider this."

We then got in touch with the municipal party committee's Organization Department, to ask whether the factory had unquestionably acknowledged that the punishment was incorrect. A comrade relevant to this case said, "Previously, they hadn't acknowledged an error; what their attitude is now is still unclear. But it's obvious that revoking her position is unacceptable, and that they must admit their error within the originally specified framework, making a self-criticism; only in this way can cadres be educated, and Chen Xiu herself be educated." He said: "As for whether or not the text should be published, why don't you study the matter and decide on your own! We have no opinion."

In order to thoroughly clarify facts, we again consulted the Party cell at the Mechanical Repairs Factory, asking, once and for all, whether or not they believe the punishment was incorrect. A member of the factory's Party cell stated precisely, "Our Party cell has always believed that the punishment given to Chen Xiu at the time was correct." We also asked, "what are your opinions on the contents of the text? Are there factual inconsistencies or not?" The answer was, "Our factory director has seen the text and didn't express any particular opinion. But our punishment at the time of Chen Xiu can't really be counted as punishment."

We believe that to this day, the factory leadership has definitely not acknowledged their mistake; moreover, their attitude is improper and their reasoning irrational. The letter from the head factory stating that the factory had already acknowledged that the punishment was incorrect does in turn not conform with facts. Having considered the matter, we still believe the text should be publicized (has already been publicized).
