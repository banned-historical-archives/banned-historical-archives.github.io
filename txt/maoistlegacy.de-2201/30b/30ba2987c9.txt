# Periodicals must not discuss important policy problems that have not been subject to Central decision

From the report of the Hainan Li and Miao Peoples' Autonomous Area (HAA) Party Committee: On the second of February, the "People's Daily" carried a piece entitled, "Where is the 'Golden Key' to open the Treasure Island with?", and in which was noted that everyone was discussing whether or not it would be possible to merge the now separate Party Committees of the Hainan Administrative Region and of the Hainan Li and Miao Peoples' Autonomous Area. This comment provoked widespread debate among local cadres, generating a lot of confusion. The HAA Party Committee believes that this is a very important issue which concerns the Party nationalities policy, the unity of all Hainan peoples. If discussion is openly related in a newspaper or periodical, there will only be extreme confusion among cadres, increasing the difficulties facing our work, and provoking envy between cadres.

Seeing that relevant structural reforms, institutional consolidation, labor wages and other important issues involve the broader masses and cadre corps, we must go about affairs cautiously. Open dissemination must concertedly and without exception follow the specifications of official Central decisions. In any situation, one must abide by the position of unified Central offices and departments. Anything that has yet to be subject to Central decision, or subject to decision but no official proclamation, must not be disseminated in newspapers, periodicals, on radio, or on TV. Neither may differing opinions internally ventilated be openly publicized or discussed, so as to avoid misunderstandings and unsettled tendencies. This is to ask that Party committee propaganda departments and news units at all levels take note of and stringently grasp this issue.
