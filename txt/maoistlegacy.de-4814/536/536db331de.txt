# On the Appropriate Handling of Materials Related to Unjust, False, and Mistaken Cases Dating from the Great Cultural Revolution Movement

To Provincial, Municipal, and Autonomous Regional Bureaus of Public Security:

Recently, a number of localities have inquired about how they should process materials forming part of the unjust, false, and mistaken cases dating from the Great Cultural Revolution movement. After having investigated the matter and in order to do a proper and good job of it in accordance with the spirit of the relevant regulations issued by the Center and State Council and in conformity with the actual situation in public security organs, we herewith notify you as follows:

1. Materials forming part of those cases processed by public security organs in the course of the Great Cultural Revolution movement that upon reexamination have been overturned as unjust, false, or mistaken are to be dealt with in one of the following ways depending on the circumstances:

a. The following materials are to be preserved and to be stored in the archives together with the concerned party’s appeal documents, the conclusion announcing his rehabilitation, and investigation reports and testimony documenting the same: the basis in writing for the launching of the original case [investigation] and the [original] leadership’s comments [on it]; technical appraisals; reports documenting important succesful detective work; reports on major breakthroughs; requests, permissions, and decisions to detain and arrest people; detention, arrest, and search warrants; search records; lists of confiscated and handled items; conclusive reports; indictments; verdicts; release notifications, illness and death reports; and reports containing requests for instructions as well as decisions to subject the concerned party to reeducation through labor, surveillance, or the affixation of a [political] label.

b. The following materials may, after having been signed for, be returned to the concerned party: self-examinations and accounts, exposures and denunciations produced under duress by the person subject to investigation; letters, manuscripts, documents, photographs and diaries belonging to the person under investigation and not related to the rehabilitation.

c. Remaining miscellaneous materials may in principle be destroyed after having been weeded, itemized, and recorded and after permission has been obtained from the leadership.

2. Clerical material and cadre investigation materials from the Great Cultural Revolution movement, the contents of which bear upon unjust, false, and mistaken cases, should be disposed of in accordance with the “Opinion of the State Archives Bureau Concerning the Disposal of Clerical Materials Dating from the Great Cultural Revolution Movement the Contents of Which Bear Upon Unjust, False, and Mistaken Cases” as circulated with a comment by the CCP Center and State Council on 3 November 1979 and the “Notification in the Matter of the Disposal of Cadre Investigation Materials Dating from the Great Cultural Revolution Movement” issued by the CCP Central Organization Department on 30 November 1979.

3. Original dossier material concerning cases dating from before the Great Cultural Revolution movement that now upon reexamination have been overturned need not be disposed of separately but may be preserved in the original case dossier together with the conclusion announcing the rehabilitation after reexamination and other relevant material.

You are asked to abide by and implement the above notification in accordance with the concrete circumstances in your locality.
