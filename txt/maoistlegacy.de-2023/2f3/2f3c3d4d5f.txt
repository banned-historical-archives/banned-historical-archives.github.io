# Internal documents that are inconsistent with facts must also be more correct

In a letter from the Ministry of Education Party cell on January 19 this year, comrade Hu Qiaomu expressed the following opinions: "All reports in internal publications that in some part contain inconsistencies with facts must in the same publications publish still more correct declarations, making every effort to cultivate a trustworthy and responsible style, in the same way as public reporting. The appearance of parts inconsistent with facts in material for internal reference is difficult to avoid; once they have appeared, one must still proceed with a responsible attitude."
