# The CCP Center Comments on and Transmits the Notice regarding the “Implementation Plan for the Center’s Decision in Favor of a General Removal of Rightist Labels”

September 17, 1978 · Zhongfa (1978) No. 55

The Center agrees with the “Implementation plan for the Center’s decision in favor of a general removal of rightist labels,” submitted by the Central Organization Department, the Central Propaganda Department, the Central United Front Work Department, the Public Security Bureau, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs on August 25, 1978. It is hereby issued to you with the expectation that you will put it into practice.

To succeed in finding suitable positions for former rightists and to fix the party’s policy, this is an important matter in the political life of our nation. Among these people, there are a considerable number that possess useful skills. It is not only about providing a solution to ensure their livelihood, it is necessary to plan comprehensively, to carefully carry out the work in order to mobilize their enthusiasm, and bring out their strengths in the service of socialism.

Concerning people who have been wrongfully labeled in the past, rectification work needs to be carried out well. Counterrevolutionaries must be eliminated wherever found, mistakes must be corrected whenever discovered; this has been the guiding principle of our party all along. If it has already been revealed that someone has been wrongfully labeled, even if it was many years ago, a correction [of the label] must be granted. The criteria for rectification are specified in the relevant regulations of the “The CCP Center’s Notice on ‘Criteria for distinguishing rightists’” issued on October 15, 1957. It is our hope that party committees at all levels take their responsibility to heart and carry out this work conscientiously.

Comrades Deng Kui and Ulanhu further report

Chairman Hua and Party Center:

With the Center’s approval, the work conference convened by the CCP Central Organization Department, the CCP Central Propaganda Department, the CCP Central United Front Work Department, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, on the [subject of] general removal of rightist labels was convened from June 14 to 22 in Yantai, Shandong. The conference has drafted the “Implementation plan for the Center’s decision in favor of a general removal of rightist labels.” After the conclusion of the conference, the five departments have once again jointly made revisions; we now report the revised draft to those above and ask for examination and approval.

Implementation plan for the Center’s decision in favor of a general removal of rightist labels (Excerpt)

## Central Organization Department, Central Propaganda Department, Central United Front Work Department, Public Security Bureau, Ministry of Civil Affairs, August 25, 1978

In a felicitous situation where the first effects of the [the policy to] Grasp the Key Link to Run the Country are becoming apparent, Chairman Hua and the Party Center—upholding the great banner of Chairman Mao, carrying on the mission bequeathed by Chairman Mao, and implementing the line of the Eleventh Party Congress—have made a wise decision in favor of a general removal of rightist labels. This has great importance for mobilizing all positive elements, transforming negative factors into positive factors, advancing stability and unity, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and realizing the principal task of the new era.

In 1957, our great leader and teacher Chairman Mao personally launched and took charge of the struggle against rightists, which was a grand socialist revolution on both the political battlefront and the ideological battlefront. Chairman Mao once declared that if we did not win this war, we would be unable to build up socialism. The great victory in the struggle against the rightists consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat and advanced the development of our cause for socialist revolution and socialist construction.

In accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao, the party adopted a policy to educate and reform rightists. In 1959, Chairman Mao gave the instruction to divide rightists into categories and, in stages, remove the labels of already reformed rightists. From 1959 to 1964, the majority of  rightists, divided into five groups, had their labels removed one after another.

In 1975, in parallel to the amnesty that led to the release of all war criminals in custody, Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou gave instructions that Zhang Naiqi was to have his label removed; this decision produced very good results. At this time, it was considered that rightists had already gone through a long period of education and reform, and the vast majority of them had changed their ways and displayed relatively good behavior, which prepared the way for a general removal of rightist labels. However, because of disruption and sabotage by the “Gang of Four” Anti-Party Clique, the proletarian policy of Chairman Mao could not be realized at the time.

In order to resolutely implement the directives by Chairman Mao and the Party Center in relation to the work to reform rightists and in order to conscientiously put into practice Zhongfa (1978) No. 11, we present the following regulations concerning related issues:

On the issue of providing a suitable position

It is imperative to make a serious effort in order to improve the work to find a suitable position for former rightists and to put party policy into practice. Whether it be fighting a revolution, building socialism, or carrying out the four modernizations, it is always preferable to have a few more people. Among the people whose rightist labels are removed, there is a considerable number that possess useful skills. Finding them a suitable position is not only about providing a solution to ensure their livelihood; of even greater importance is mobilizing their enthusiasm in service of socialism.

1. For those who continue in their original function, if they are able to work, suitable assignments should be prepared for them; if they have any special skill let them develop it. If they are not able to work, make preparations for [their] retirement or full retirement.[1]

On the issue of wages following the arrangement of a suitable position: for those who have been removed from their salary rank and only provided an alimony to cover living expenses, the salary rank should be assessed on the basis of the work currently assigned to them; for those who have had their rank lowered or their salary decreased as a punishment, the salary rank is generally to remain the same. However, if the salary rank has decreased too much, suitable adjustments are permissible.

If it is necessary to make preparations for retirement or full retirement, the years of working must be counted as a continuous whole. When determining the criteria used to calculate compensation after retirement or the sum of the pension, the decision should follow either the salary rank of the one labeled as a rightist after the disciplinary measures had been administered, or the rank after the new reevaluation of the salary. If the salary is so low that it poses difficulties for the subsistence of the person, the standards for calculating the salary can be raised to a suitable level. The compensation for retirement and full retirement is to be provided by the relevant unit; if the person did not have employment, the county or town is responsible for taking care of compensation.

2. When arranging a suitable position for those who have been discharged from public office, consideration must be taken to the particular circumstances of each person. Concerning those who possess special skills or whose work is in demand, the relevant department can reinstate them. As for the others, the departments for organization, personnel, and labor are responsible for arranging a position. Those who are old and weak, who have lost their capacity to work but do not have any source of income to live on, are to be provided with social assistance that will permit them to lead a life comparable to that of a local ordinary resident or commune member. Those who have no means of support in the countryside, but who have relatives who can provide for them in the city, are allowed to return and settle in the city.

For those who have already resigned or retired before, their cases can be handled in line with these same guidelines.

3. Those in labor re-education units, except in the event that the person in question agrees to remain to find a position at the unit, should be transferred from the labor re-education unit in accordance with the aforementioned principles. The responsibility for the arrangements rests with the provincial, municipal, or autonomous regional departments for organization, personnel, and labor. Those who remain to take up a position within the unit are to be classified as state employees and given a corresponding salary.

4. For those former students of an institution of higher learning who have not been assigned to a workplace, a suitable workplace is to be arranged and the salary rank evaluated in relation to their specialized skills and the overall demand.

5. For former military cadres who do not return to the armed forces, the local government is responsible for arrangements.

6. The responsibility for managing the planning of new expanded staff quotas and labor targets falls primarily upon the province, municipality, and autonomous region. If the situation can truly not be resolved, the provincial, municipal, or autonomous regional party committees, after having thoroughly informed themselves and investigated the situation, can report it to the State Planning Commission for a solution.

7. When arranging a suitable position, the unified leadership of the provincial, municipal, or autonomous regional party committee decide on the overall planning, while the administrative responsibility is that of the departments of organization, personnel, labor, civil affairs, and other departments at the county level or higher.

Some policy issues

1. After rightists have had their labels removed, they are no longer to be referred to as “rightists” or “de-labeled rightists.” As for issues such as promotion, increase in rank, salary adjustment, award, and bestowment of titles, these people are to be treated in the same way as other workers; they must not be discriminated against.

2. Regarding family members and children, they must be evaluated based on their individual political attitude. If they have been improperly treated because of their connection with rightists, the matter must be settled in a suitable manner and in accordance with party policy. In the future, if they try to join the Communist Youth League, the party, or the army, or when they apply for a school or for work and so forth, the procedures must not be affected [by this connection].

3. Former party members who were ousted from the party are not to have their party membership reinstated categorically. Only after having gone through the necessary tests to see if they fulfill the criteria to join the party can they rejoin.

4. Concerning those workers and peasants who were labeled rightists or anti-socialist elements, their cases must be rectified in line with the September 1957 central directives opposing the labeling of workers and peasants as rightists or anti-socialist elements. Middle school students, soldiers in the People’s Liberation Army, policemen, shop assistants, public school teachers, and other similar personnel who have been labeled as rightists or anti-socialist elements are to have their cases handled in line with these same directives. If they are in need of work placement, a suitable position shall be arranged.

5. Insurgents and defectors who were labeled as historical counterrevolutionaries because they were found to be rightists, must have their historical counterrevolutionary label removed at the same time as their rightist label and be treated according to their status as insurgents and defectors.

6. Where a decision not to punish someone as a counterrevolutionary was reached in the past, or if it was determined that a person only had ordinary historical issues, and if the person was later labeled as a historical counterrevolutionary because of his or her rightist label, the historical counterrevolutionary label should be removed at the same time as the rightist label. People who have been designated any other label due to the rightist issue are to be treated according to the principles above.

In the event that a historical counterrevolutionary was subsequently branded as a rightist, only the rightist label is to be removed.

7. Concerning rightists who have committed new offenses and who have already been sentenced in accordance with the law, the removal of their label should not be publicly announced, but after they have fulfilled their sentence they are no longer to be treated as rightists.

8. Those disabled while performing their duty and who consequently lost their ability to work are to be given a living subsidy, social assistance, or labor insurance, in accordance with the relevant state regulations. To the families and children of deceased who were still employed by the state at the time of their death, a pension is to be paid out in accordance with state regulations.

9. Confiscated property is to be returned to the person in question or to his or her family. If the whereabouts of the belongings are unknown, the situation must be explained and the matter settled according to the circumstances.

10. If someone has already previously had the rightist label removed, but the policy (including arranging for a work position, salary, and children) was not carried out, the case can be handled in accordance with the regulations above.

On the issue of correction

In the spirit of Zhongfa (1978) No. 11 and “The CCP Center’s Notice on ‘Criteria for distinguishing rightists,’” rightists should not ordinarily have their cases reviewed or reversed. As for cases where there is indeed a question of a mistaken label, they must be corrected according to [the principle of] seeking truth from facts.

In the 1957 Center’s “Criteria for distinguishing rightists” approved by Chairman Mao, there are criteria that clearly stipulate who should be labeled a rightist and who should not be labeled a rightist. At the time, there were certain areas and departments that were not able to fully follow the regulations of the document, and this led to the mistaken labeling of some people. Today, when we are dealing with these issues, the basis must still be the 1957 central regulations. In all cases where the person determined to be a rightist fulfilled the criteria for being labeled a rightist, the question is whether his or her label should be removed, not if the case is to be corrected. All cases where the person should not have been labeled a rightist, but was wrongfully labeled, must be corrected according to the principle of seeking truth from facts. Proceeding in this way has a profound significance for the restoration and development of the fine party tradition of seeking truth from facts.

Concerning appeals requesting correction, they are to be accepted by a party committee above county level in the present unit or area of the plaintiff. The party committee will then transmit the case to be handled by the unit that originally decided on the rightist label. The original unit must investigate and consider the case earnestly before making its final decision. If the original unit revokes its decision, the responsibility to settle the matter falls on a party committee above county level in the unit or area where the plaintiff currently resides. The decision to correct has to be approved by a party committee at the county level or higher. The unit that receives the case for examination and approval has to take full responsibility for the appeal and pay close attention to how it is handled.

Those who have had their request for correction approved also have their political reputation restored and the unit that handled the correction is responsible for providing them with suitable work. Their wages are to be restored to their original levels, but without any compensation for salary cuts. If someone is living under harsh conditions, he or she should be given necessary financial aid.

If someone was originally a member of the Communist Party and if there has not been any discovery of new, major issues, he or she should have their party membership restored. If someone was originally a Communist Youth League member, their expulsion from the Youth League is to be revoked.

Reinforce leadership of the party committees, perfect the propaganda and education work

The work for the general removal of rightist labels, the implementation of suitable arrangements, and the diligent effort to carry out the correction work in line with the principle of seeking truth from facts, has a heavy policy character; party committees at all levels must reinforce their leadership. We must establish a sound work environment. Under the unified leadership of the party committee, all relevant departments must work in close cooperation in complementary interaction with each other; actively assume their task; reinforce investigation work; and earnestly deal with petitions and visits. These issues must be solved in an earnest manner, without any shifting of responsibility back and forth, and without passing on conflicts to higher authorities. Together, we will carry out this work efficiently.

We must perfect propaganda and education work in order to make the vast numbers of cadres and the masses understand the great significance of the struggle against rightists and the party policies concerning the reform of rightists. The profound significance of the decision by Chairman Hua and the Party Center to remove all rightist labels must be properly understood, and the people who have had their rightist labels removed must be properly dealt with.

With regards both to those who have had their rightist labels removed and those who have had their mistaken case corrected, there is need for ideological education. They are to be encouraged to study diligently, reform their way of thinking, and to make a contribution, from their individual position, to the socialist project.

Appendix:

CCP Center Notice on “Criteria for Distinguishing Rightists”

To the Shanghai bureau; party committees of each province, city, and autonomous region; central departments, committees, and party leadership groups; party committees directly subordinate to the Center; party committees of national organs; and the General Political Department (this document can be sent down to county committees and corresponding county-level party organizations):

Since the beginning of the struggle against rightists, many places and departments have in different ways drafted some criteria for distinguishing rightists and requested that the Center grant examination and approval. Considering the practical requirements within the struggle, the Center believes that there is the need to draw up unified criteria in order to avoid that units tend to be either overly lax or overly stern when distinguishing rightists. Now we are sending to you the criteria for distinguishing rightists that have been discussed and passed by the Center and ask that you promptly pass them down to all units engaged in the struggle against rightists. They are to be deliberated conscientiously and this document should at once be taken as the criterion for distinguishing rightists. At the same time, we expect you to note:

(1) Overall, the national struggle against rightists is being conducted in a healthy manner, those distinguished as rightists generally fit the bill, but there are also situations where too many or too few have been distinguished [as rightists]. Moreover, as the campaign reached a more thorough stage, and after a conscientious revision of undue leniency and right-deviationists moods, some units widened the criteria for rightists somewhat, to the extent that a situation arose where too many rightists were distinguished [as such]. This must attract more attention. Regardless if too many or too few have been distinguished [as rightists], they all have to be corrected without delay [using the principle of] seeking truth from facts according to the correct criteria. But in cases where too many rightists have been distinguished [as such], the unit that must correct them must take note to safeguard the masses’ and the activists’ enthusiasm and sense of justice, they must not cause people to gain the erroneous impression that “the struggle against rightists has gone too far.” Some moderate rightists have spoken and behaved in ways detrimental to socialism, but they are not sufficiently rightist. If they have been struggled against as rightists, there can be no public announcement that the criticism against them was wrong at the moment, because they have made errors in speech or action that they should be criticized for. However, they should be internally reclassified as moderate rightists, and treated as moderate rightists, and attention should be paid to winning them over through more education. When the appropriate occasion arises, there can be an announcement that, because the circumstances were trivial and they already repented, their rightist label is removed.

(2) To correctly distinguish rightists, and to reach the goal of distinguishing neither too many nor too few, appropriate procedures of examination and approval are necessary in addition to the appropriate criteria. Upon confirming a list of rightists, each unit must report it to leading party organs at the county level or above for examination and approval. Lists of rightists among high-level intellectuals, important democratic personages, and other rightists with special circumstances must be reported to the leading party organs at the province level or above for examination and approval.

(3) Higher-level leadership organs, in addition to being obliged to conscientiously examine the lists of rightists reported from subordinate organs, must also educate party members and the masses to attach absolute importance to the conscientious study and concrete analysis of the actual circumstances, and to do everything possible to avoid exaggeration and one-sidedness. At the same time, they must proactively and carefully conduct frequent random inspections and consult the detailed materials on rightists from subordinate units; errors of a bias toward leniency or severity contained therein must be promptly corrected; and the lower levels must be given practical assistance to grasp the correct criteria for distinction, on the basis of a presentation of actual examples, involving concrete persons and materials, concerning the demarcations between extreme rightists, ordinary rightists, and moderate rightists.

Criteria for distinguishing rightists

## (I)

All those whose opinions and actions are of the character listed below should be distinguished as rightists:

(1) Opposing the socialist system. Opposing the socialist revolution in cities and villages, opposing the Communist Party and the People’s Government’s basic policies regarding social economy (such as industrialization or unified purchase and sale); negating the achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction; holding on to a capitalist standpoint, and propagating the capitalist system and bourgeois exploitation.

(2) Opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, opposing democratic centralism. Attacking the anti-imperialist struggle and the People’s Government’s foreign affairs policies; attacking the struggle to purge counterrevolutionaries; negating the achievements of the “five big campaigns”;[2] opposing the reform of the bourgeoisie and bourgeois intellectuals; attacking the Communist Party and the People’s Government’s personnel system and cadre policies; demanding that bourgeois politics and law, culture and education replace socialist politics and law, culture and education.

(3) Opposing the Communist Party’s leading position in the political life of the state. Opposing the Communist Party’s leadership over economic enterprise and cultural enterprise with the aim of opposing socialism and the Communist Party, maliciously attacking the Communist Party and the People’s Government’s leading organs and leading persons, slandering worker and peasant cadres as well as revolutionary activists, slandering the Communist Party’s revolutionary activities and organizational principles.

(4) Splitting the people’s unity with the aim of opposing socialism and opposing the Communist Party. Instigating the masses to oppose the Communist Party and the People’s Government; instigating splits between workers and peasants; instigating splits between ethnic groups; slandering the socialist camp, instigating splits between peoples of various countries in the socialist camp.

(5) Organizing and actively participating in cliques opposing socialism and the Communist Party; plotting to overthrow the Communist Party’s leadership at a given department or a given unit at the grass-roots level; instigating disturbances in opposition to the Communist Party and/or in opposition to the People’s Government.

(6) Making suggestions to rightists guilty of committing the above-mentioned crimes, cultivating relations [with them], passing on intelligence [to them], or reporting the secrets of revolutionary organizations to them.

## (II)

Those with any of the conditions listed below should be distinguished as extreme rightists:

(1) Schemers, main culprits, ringleaders, and backbone elements of rightist activities.

(2) Elements who put forward anti-party, anti-socialist opinions of a programmatic character, and who actively advocate opinions of this kind.

(3) Elements who carry out anti-party and anti-socialist activities that are particularly vile and particularly resolute.

(4) Elements who were consistently anti-communist and anti-people in the past, and who during this rightist offensive once again actively carry out reactionary activities.

## (III)

Those with any of the conditions listed below should have their errors criticized and revised, but they should not be distinguished as rightists:

(1) Even if their opinions are erroneous and their wording sharp, people who fundamentally do not oppose socialism and the party’s leadership, but only express discontent and/or raise criticism against particular work systems, particular policies that are not part of any fundamental principles, operational problems, problems of academic nature, specific organizations of the Communist Party, or specific functionaries, should not be distinguished as rightists. Similarly, people who fundamentally do not oppose socialism and the party’s leadership but who simply have some ideological errors should also not be distinguished as rightists.

(2) People who have had thinking similar to the rightists, but who have never published or disseminated it, and who already consider it erroneous and have voluntarily made self-criticisms; or people who have by chance spoken words similar to the rightists, who now acknowledge their errors, and who have consistently not been anti-party or anti-socialist in the past, should not be distinguished as rightists.

(3) People who have publicized erroneous opinions concerning the socialist economic political system or the Communist Party’s leadership, but who have not actively propagated them and of whom the facts prove that this has not stemmed from animosity, who have had their errors pointed out and expressed willingness to change, should not be distinguished as rightists.

(4) People who on a single occasion blindly echoed rightist anti-party or anti-socialist words and actions, or who on a single occasion were deceived to join in a rightist clique, or who on a single occasion were taken advantage of by rightists, only to quickly take the correct position and break off relations with the rightists upon realizing the rightist errors, should not be distinguished as rightists.

(5) People who once assumed a reactionary standpoint in the past, who at present have still not shown any significant changes, but who at the time of the rightist offensive did not carry out reactionary activities, should not be distinguished as rightists.

(6) All suspicious elements who are situated between the rightists and moderate rightists must without exception not be distinguished as rightists before sufficient material has been discovered to confirm that they are rightists; moreover the methods used in the struggle against rightists are not to be used against them.
