# The CCP Center Comments on and Transmits the CCP Central United Front Work Department Request for Instructions concerning the Question of Removing the Labels of Local Nationalist Elements1

## October 14, 1979 · Zhongfa (1979) No. 68

The Center agrees with the Central United Front Work Department’s “Request Concerning the Question of Removing the Local Nationalist Element Label,” and now transmits it to you. We hope that you will implement it accordingly.

Request from the CCP Central United Front Work Department concerning the Question of Removing the Labels of Local Nationalist Elements

Center:

During the Anti-Rightist struggle of 1957 and the following years, our party engaged in the struggle of criticizing local nationalism in some ethnic minority areas. At that time, the tendency towards local nationalism among some ethnic minorities grew. Engaging in this struggle was necessary for strengthening ethnic solidarity and consolidating national unity. However, there also existed a trend towards exaggeration.

During the struggle of criticizing local nationalism, each locality defined a group of local nationalist elements. Some were labeled as rightist elements, and some as local nationalist elements. There were two types of situations in which [people] were labeled local nationalist elements. One [type] was handled as a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy, and the other was handled as a contradiction among the people. Following the transmission of Central Document (1978) no. 112 and [Central Document (1978)] no. 553 down to lower levels, the label of rightist element was completely removed. Many localities proposed that the local nationalist element label also be removed. According to our understanding, quite a few localities have already announced the removal of the local nationalist element label, but some localities have still not or have not completely removed it. Regarding this, our opinion is that all those who were previously defined as local nationalist elements, regardless of whether they were treated on the basis of a contradiction between ourselves and the enemy or a contradiction among the people, should have the local nationalist element label completely removed, in the spirit of the Center. As for those who were indeed incorrectly labeled, their cases should also be corrected according to the facts. The standard for corrections should be based on the “Criteria for Determining Rightist Elements” issued by the Center on October 15, 1957,4 and the main criteria for distinguishing rightist elements among ethnic minorities are: (1) opposition to socialism; (2) opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party; and (3) destruction of national unity and ethnic solidarity. All those who have had the local nationalist element label removed and all whose cases have been corrected should be appropriately dealt with in the spirit of Central Document (1978) no. 55. We hope that the party committees at each level will combine this task with the work of removing the label of rightist element and complete this task well and conscientiously.

If the Center agrees with the opinions above, please transmit them to each locality and each relevant department for implementation.
