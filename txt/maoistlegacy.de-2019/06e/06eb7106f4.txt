# Internal publications material must not be externally disseminated

According to reports from relevant departments: Some internal publications edited and printed by domestic units often describe and portray ideological trends and activities among overseas Chinese, people of Chinese blood with foreign citizenship and our students at universities and colleges abroad. Since some materials are not ardently verified, the matters at hand are not portrayed in a comprehensive enough manner, and seeing as the distribution scope of these publications is in some cases quite wide, administration is lax, [and] some comrade do not pay attention to preserving secrets, easily disclosing the contents of internal publications to the outside world, even sending them to the people portrayed, the result is that intense reactions have been noted from some relevant persons, even causing or aggravating some contradictions and conflicts, bringing difficulties to our work and creating passiveness. The above situation merits the attention of concerned departments.

1. Materials carried in internal publications must pay attention to verifying facts. The situation of overseas Chinese, people of Chinese blood with foreign citizenship in some countries and areas, is rather complicated; there are frequently contradictions among them. Therefore, regardless of whether it is in an open report or in an internal release, all material must be ardently verified, making every effort to be more comprehensive. In particular, be even more prudent when making assessments of people, naming as few people as possible, or naming none at all.

2. Strengthen administration of internal publications; do not arbitrarily expand circulation ranges. Comrades authorized to read internal publications as specified in regulations must unquestionably respect regulations on safeguarding secrets, the distinction between internal and external, that one may not casually talk about or disclose materials from internal publications to one’s friends and children; still less may one give internal materials to outsiders, or even the people concerned, for review, reprinting or copying. This must be respected as a matter of organizational discipline, and may not be violated.
