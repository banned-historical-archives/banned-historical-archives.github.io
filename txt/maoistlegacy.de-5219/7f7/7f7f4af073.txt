# Wuhan Municipal Revolutionary Committee Public Security Bureau Document

## Wugong (1979) No. 58

NOTICE

In accordance with the Provincial Committee Document No. 139 (1978), and in the spirit of the 1979 General Meeting of the chiefs of the Provincial, Prefectural, and Municipal Public Security Bureaus, the handling of the relevant archival materials during the reversal of unjust, false, and mistaken cases must be approached with care. To unify requirements and procedures, [we] issue this notice to specifically address the handling of files:

1. Whenever the reversal or correction of unjust, false, and mistaken cases is approved, the types of archival material can in principle be distinguished as follows: case materials submitted for approval, ratified decisions on treatment, arrest, detention, and search warrants, documentation of inquiries and conclusions, court verdicts and decisions, review and reversal conclusions and other evidence; these materials are to be archived by public security and judicial departments for future reference. Materials containing false accusations and a confusion of right and wrong are to be destroyed without exception. Confessions by the person in question as well as letters, photos, notebooks, books, and other documents or items confiscated in searches, are to be returned to the person and a receipt is to be written and archived for future reference. All materials to be destroyed must be indexed; only after the person supervising [the case] and the person handling [the case] have provided their signatures can they be handed over for destruction. With respect to cases partially mistaken and partially reversed, the interrogation records must be treated differently: the portion containing false accusations and a confusion of right and wrong can be removed and destroyed, but statements with facts of illegality and crimes must be kept.

2. Those formerly labeled as rightists but who were not sent away for reform through labor or for re-education through labor, are to be treated in line with Paragraph 14 of the jointly issued Central Organization Department, Central Propaganda Department, Central United Front Work Department, Ministry of Public Security, and Ministry of Civil Affairs Document (1979) No. 143. The file belonging to a person whose [label] has been corrected and [the decision] ratified is to be handled in accordance with the Central Organization Department’s unified guidelines. As for personnel files involving historical issues and where [the person] was labeled a rightist element and sent to reform through labor during the airing of views, only the rightist (or respective viewpoints) sections should be discarded in the process of removing or correcting the labels; the materials related to historical issues should be filed along with a copy of the “Decision to Terminate Re-education through Labor.” It falls on the public security organs to manage the file as that of a “three labors” person.[1]

3. In the spirit of CCP Central Document (1979) No. 5, the files belonging to four types elements whose labels have already been removed are to be managed as per usual by the local police station or protection section. In the rural people’s communes where no local police station has been set up, the commune is responsible for keeping the files. If someone had their label removed in the past, the file can be treated as if the label was removed now. For those who were mistakenly designated or labeled as “four types elements,” they are not only to be provided with a “Decision to Correct the Mistaken Designation as Four Types Element” upon revision, but a “Form for Approved Corrections of Mistaken Designations as Four Types Elements” and the “decision stub” must be archived together with their file for future reference. If any new issues or new crimes should arise and a separate file has to be started, then the political treatment should be considered in light of policies from higher levels; the file is to be kept for future reference. When there is a change of household registration, the file must be transferred into the care of the prefectural public security or protection departments.

Additionally, when it comes to minors or children who scribbled reactionary slogans and where a file has been compiled [on them] in which the conclusion was made that [they had acted out of] naivety and ignorance and without a political motive and [they] were then educated, their file must invariably be placed with the local branch or service office. If there has already been education for the past actions, there is no need for the grassroots level public security and protection departments to treat [these actions] as problems to be introduced upon the application for school or employment.

With the hope that all units will resolutely carry out the above notice.
