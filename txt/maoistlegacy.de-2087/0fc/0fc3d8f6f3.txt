# Do not openly report execution cases that have not yet obtained judicial approval

During the first four months of this year, nine newpapers in various provinces and larger municipalities have carried reports on ten cases of capital punishment. Among these, eight have not yet received a final verdict, not yet being reviewed and given a final adjudication by the Supreme People's Court (as specified in the "Decision on the problem of approval of capital punishment cases" adopted on June 10th this year by the NPC Standing Committee, to be used henceforth). These kinds of reports are harmful to the law, [and] cause confusion in the thinking of the masses; international implications are also unfavorable.

Henceforth, one must pay attention to the following problems in propaganda relating to this problem:

1. Do not publish or broadcast verdicts on capital punishment that have not yet obtained judicial approval.

2. Mural notices on capital punishment verdicts that have obtained judicial approval may be pasted up [i.e., affixed to a wall] by People's Courts after review of case details and in line with local circumstances. Normally, these cases should not be carried in newspapers, in small print or otherwise, or broadcast. When publication of certified individual model cases is necessary, approval must be obtained from party committees.

3. Along similar lines, other criminal or civil verdicts must not be carried in newpapers or broadcast. When publication of certified individual model cases is necessary in the carrying out of propaganda, the agreement of the people's court must be obtained.
