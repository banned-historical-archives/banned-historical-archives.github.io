July 5, 1983 - Zhongbanfa (1983) No. 52

The “Request for Instructions Concerning Problems Arising from Former Industrialists and Merchants Being Downsized and Sent Down to the Rural Areas during the Early 1960s” submitted by the United Front Work Department, the State Economic Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Labor and Personnel has already been in principle agreed on by the Central Secretariat and the State Council. It is hereby forwarded to you. Please implement it in accordance with local circumstances. The scope of application should be restricted to article 1 of the report, [and] not expanded.

Request for Instructions Concerning Problems Arising from Former Industrialists and Merchants Being Downsized and Sent Down to the Rural Areas during the Early 1960s

CCP Central Committee, State Council of the PRC:

During the early 1960s, our national economy experienced great difficulties. During the adjustment of the national economy many employees of a few enterprises were downsized and sent down to rural areas.

To implement a “full package policy” (bao xialai, bao daodi) for former industrialists and merchants, the Central Government and the State Council at the time ruled that capitalists, their representatives and other private partners receiving fixed interest who participated in joint state-private ownership during or before the 1956 socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce (subsequently shortened to “former industrialists and merchants”) as well as their family members (wives or husbands), “are not to be sent down to rural areas” and “those who have already been sent down against their will should be sent back and assigned jobs by their original work units.” But the rules set by the Center outlined above have not been properly carried out and implemented in many regions, resulting in some former industrialists and merchants still being mobilized to be sent down to rural areas and those sent down not being sent back.

There is no accurate figure on how many former industrialists and merchants were downsized and sent down to rural areas nationwide during the early 1960s. According to surveys conducted in eighteen provinces and autonomous regions including Hebei, Liaoning, Shandong, Hunan and Sichuan, there are about xx thousand. Nationwide, the number is about xx thousand (excluding relocated family members, the same hereafter). Excluding the deceased and persons whose whereabouts are unknown, there are about xx thousand to xx thousand persons left. Among them, about twenty percent are former capitalists and about eighty percent are differentiated as laborers. From the early 1960s up until now, these people have already been down in rural areas for twenty years, most of them are now old and frail. For a few, life is difficult, especially for those that are widowed and lonely with no one to depend upon, life is even more difficult.

With the implementation of every policy since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Party Committee, these former industrialists and merchants sent down to rural areas sent droves of letters and petitioned in person requesting vehemently to be returned to the cities and be assigned jobs in accordance with Central Party Committee and State Council guidelines and policies. Otherwise, [they asked to] be allowed to retire and let their children replace them (dingti)[1] at their work, or to have their money returned or be given other life options. If this problem goes unsolved for much longer, it will have adverse effects on stability and unity, as well as the construction of the Four Modernizations. Each locality urgently wishes for the Center to agree on a unified solution.

We are of the opinion that, if the lingering historical issue of former industrialists and merchants being downsized and sent down to rural areas during the early 1960s were to be solved now, it would be necessary to consider that our country’s national economy still must continue to be adjusted. The nation is still facing economic and financial difficulties. At the same time, the workers that were downsized and sent down must be dealt with comprehensively while taking all factors into consideration. The number of workers downsized in the early 1960s altogether is around twenty million; because of the reasons mentioned before, it is difficult to send them back to the cities and assign [jobs]. Thus, save for the miniscule number of former industrialists and merchants who were downsized and sent down to rural areas who can be sent back and assigned [jobs] in accordance with political and work needs, as well as local circumstances of possibility, most of them shall not be sent back. But considering Party and State originally committed to a “Full Package Policy” approach when dealing with former industrialists and merchants, and the fact that the former industrialists and merchants who were downsized and sent down are old and frail and are living difficult lives, they should be resettled locally, our detailed opinions are as follows:  (1) All former capitalists, their representatives and other industrialists and merchants receiving fixed interest who were mobilized or forcibly downsized and sent down to rural areas from state-owned and joint state-private enterprises in the early 1960s (excluding those who resigned voluntarily, undeniably returned home of their own volition, have had their money returned or are already arranged to work in commune- and brigade-run enterprises and have a wage-based income) shall receive a monthly fixed living allowance of no less than 20 yuan (in addition to their non-staple food subsidies) from their original enterprises (or their leading professional departments) from the day of issue of this document onward. After their deaths, the original enterprises shall pay funeral subsidies and relatives’ pensions according to the way an employee of an enterprise [would be treated] after death. The necessary costs outlined above should be listed as non-business expenses. Funds not already sent or sent as a living allowance under the threshold of this plan will not be reimbursed; [those with] existing rural hukou shall not be converted into nonagricultural population and they shall not switch to consuming commodity grain.

Their children shall not take over their jobs, but be treated the same as children of commune members in terms of job recruitment in rural areas.

(2) The funding issue of those who are differentiated as laborers among the former industrialists and merchants who were downsized and sent down to rural areas will be discussed in the future in accordance with the provisions of “CCP Center Comments on and Transmits a Report from Six Departments Including the CCP Central United Front Work Department with Request for Instructions on the Issue of Differentiating Laborers from Former Industrialists and Merchants” (Zhongfa [1979] No. 84) of November 1979.

(3) To deal with the above-mentioned problems, the ideological and political work on the former industrialists and merchants, cadres and employees, must be carried out earnestly and well.

(4) This work shall be led by the United Front Work Department of each locality and implemented together with relevant departments such as the State Economic Committee, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce, and the Ministry of Labor and Personnel.

[1] Dingti 顶替 referred to a policy of employment inheritance in which a retired worker or cadre would be replaced by their children or other relatives. Given the lack of urban employment for returning youth in this period of time and frequent complaints from families about the sent-down policies, dingti was eventually offered as a way for some youth to return to the city. The dingti system was abolished in 1986.
