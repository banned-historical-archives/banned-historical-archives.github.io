# Guidelines for journalists - preliminary draft

(Original) editor's note: "Regulations for reporters", jointly conceived and drafted by the news office of the Central Committee Propaganda Department and all central news units, has already been reviewed and improved by leading Central Committee comrades, allowing the draft document to be distributed to all news units for trial implementation. Improving and strengthening the work of journalists is an important element in the managing of the news undertaking. We ask propaganda departments in all party committees to pay full attention to difficulties and problems in the work of journalists, helping to solve them in due time and by seeking truth from facts.

1. In the line of work, consciously uphold political unity in line with the Party center, putting to use the Party line, guidelines, policies, working duties and work methods in exact, efficient and broad contact with the masses.

2. Systematically, as well as pervasively, meticulously and concretely, review and study all manner of new situations and problems that may appear in the process of modernization, listening to opinions from all sectors of society, fully grasping primary material.

3. Strictly respect facts, strictly avoid fraud and deception. Thoroughly inspect material before disseminating a news item. In the event of reporting an item inconsistent with facts, one must make corrections in due time, or take other compensatory measures.

4. Study and grasp materialist dialectics, isolating the essence and core of phenomena, distinguishing between main and secondary currents, comprehensively and thoroughly avoiding subjectivism, one-sidedness and absolutes.

5. Seriously, ardently, unswervingly and fervously conduct one's own work, leading the masses to practice the Party line and undertake Party tasks in their struggle. Pay attention to societal effects of news documents. The selection of material and content formulation, including headlines, choice of words and punctuation, must display a high sense of responsibility towards the Party and people.

6. Have the boldness to support all correct thinking and behavior compatible with the interests of the Party and people; have the boldness to combat all erroneous thinking and behavior contravening the interests of the Party and people.

7. Regarding all aspects of cadre and popular thinking, all kinds of societal trends and all reactions to and suggestions concerning the Party line, guidelines, and policy that are of reporting value but not suitable for open publication, energetically and reponsibly draft these as internal documents, providing them to leadership institutions and relevant departments.

8. Systematically respect the constitution, law, Party disciplinay committees and all units. Do not publicize confidential material. Do not follow erroneous trends.

9. Modestly and prudently study the masses, persons commanding knowledge, and reactions to material disseminated to lower levels. Do not make indiscriminate remarks, consider yourself an "imperial commissioner", or treat the people as little students.

10. Ardently study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, study the Party line, guidelines, and policy in order to dilligently practice basic techniques of collecting material and writing, learn how to use several forms of news reporting, energetically employing accuracy, distinctiveness and liveliness, generating a style of one's own.
