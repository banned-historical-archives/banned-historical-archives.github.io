# CCP Center Notice Transmitting the Shanghai Municipal Committee’s “Request for Instructions on How to Resolve the Issue of the So-Called ‘January Revolution’

## January 4, 1979 - Zhongfa (1979) No. 1

The CCP Center agrees with the Shanghai Municipal Committee’s “Request for Instructions on How to Resolve the Issue of the So-Called ‘January Revolution’” of December 4, 1978. This document is now transmitted to each party committee at the county level, the key points can be conveyed to the masses orally, but not published in newspapers or broadcast.

Request for Instructions on How to Resolve the Issue of the So-Called ‘January Revolution’

Party Center:

In January 1967, Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, Wang Hongwen, and others carried out a comprehensive power seizure in Shanghai calling it the “January Revolution.” What was this actually all about? The broad ranks of cadres and masses are asking to get the facts straight and to clarify the nature of the problem. After the reversal of the Tian’anmen Incident, these kinds of requests have become more pressing and virulent. The conditions are now ripe for resolving this issue. We now present our opinions below:

## (1)

The so-called “January Revolution” refers to the period of time from January 4, 1967, when Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan scurried back to Shanghai, until February 5, when they established the “Shanghai People’s Commune.” From the breech they created in Shanghai they carried out conspiratorial activities to fully seize power.

In 1966, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan already colluded with Lin Biao, Chen Boda and Jiang Qing, doing their utmost to incite the masses to “concentrate on the Shanghai Municipal Committee as the sole target of their attacks,” and “rebel against the Shanghai Municipal Committee.” And, through handling the “Anting Incident,”[1] behind the back of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, they signed the “Five Points” agreement with Wang Hongwen. When the Scarlet Guards[2] stood up to oppose their cooked up “Five Points” agreement, they made up rumors about the Scarlet Guards, creating the “Kangping Road Incident,” throwing the Scarlet Guards into disarray, and then paralyzing the Shanghai Municipal Committee and the organizations at each level. When analyzing the situation in Shanghai at the end of 1966, Zhang Chunqiao bragged that when the Scarlet Guards entered Kangping Road, “we telephoned the rebels to join the fight immediately. This test of strength was a turning point. As soon as this battle was fought, the Municipal Committee was paralyzed and thrown into disarray, no one listened to them, and the Scarlet Guards were also thrown into disarray” -- “the peaches in Shanghai were ripe for picking.”

On January 4, 1967, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan hurried back to Shanghai. The moment they got off the plane, they had secret discussions with Xu Jingxian, Wang Chenglong and several leaders of the “Workers’ General Headquarters” respectively. Zhang Chunqiao said, “Yao Wenyuan and I will join you.” And he said in an incendiary fashion, “We must no longer harbor any illusions about the municipal committee “the fundamental issue right now is taking back leadership authority from the hands of the capitalist-roaders,” and “to take control of strategic departments.” On January 4, the Wenhui Daily was the first to announce the power seizure; on the fifth, power was seized at the Liberation Daily; on the 9th, the publication of [Party] Branch Life[3] was resumed after having been suspended. Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan used these periodicals to “target whoever they wanted,” and to whip up counterrevolutionary opinion to overthrow everything and to fully seize power.

On January 6, under the guise of every rebel organization in the entire city, [Zhang and Yao] held the “Down with the Municipal Committee Meeting,” criticizing and struggling against comrades Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, and Yang Xiguang. They also dragged several hundred cadres of above bureau level from the entire city to the meeting place to be struggled against alongside them. They announced that they no longer recognize comrade Cao Diqiu as the Shanghai Municipal Committee secretary or as mayor, ordering comrade Chen Pixian to confess to his so-called “counterrevolutionary crimes,” and pressuring the Center to thoroughly reorganize the municipal committee. The plotters of this meeting were Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the “Gang of Four”; the meeting’s speech drafts and slogans were also examined and revised by Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. After this meeting, all organs of the municipal [party] committee and the municipal people’s committee were forced to stop working, and actual power of the whole city fell into the hands of Zhang Chunqiao, Yao Wenyuan, and Wang Hongwen.

Subsequently, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan again conspired with Wang Hongwen and Xu Jingxian, turning white into black and blurring the lines between right and wrong. They framed comrades Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu for single-handedly creating the severe situation of paralyzing production, blocking traffic, and blowing the evil wind of economism.[4] They deceived the Center and hoodwinked the masses. Going one step further, [they] stirred up a violent motion in the entire city of [forcing people to] wear tall paper hats, parading [them] through the streets, and subjecting [them] to criticism, thus extensively persecuting cadres at all levels and the broad masses.

During this period, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan spoke on the telephone nearly every day with Chen Boda and Wang Li, coordinating closely with them. Through the mass media under their control, they continuously incited “the launching of the struggle to comprehensively seize power.” Under the attack of this countercurrent, they messed up the whole country and created extremely serious consequences.

At the same time as throwing party, state, and mass organizations at all levels into disarray, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan conspired to establish their citywide political regime. On January 8, they established the “Shanghai Municipal ‘Grasp Revolution, Promote Production’ Front-Line Command,” and seized control of the railway, harbor, Changjiang Shipping, and post and telecommunications bureaus. Zhang Chunqiao shouted: “the Front-Line Command can be called the ‘Economic Soviet’ and replaces the Shanghai Municipal People’s Committee.” They also replaced the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau with the “Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Protection Committee,” and replaced the municipal [party] committee with the “Rebel Organizations’ Liaison Station” as the highest authority in the whole city. In reality, this was just a vain attempt to transform the party and abolish the party to their liking. Zhang Chunqiao also incited Xu Jingxian to go to the heads of the “Workers’ General Headquarters” with the intent of putting up big slogans stating: “Support Zhang Chunqiao as the First Secretary of the Municipal Committee.” On January 19, at a meeting of this motley crew, they presumptuously compared their counterrevolutionary power seizure with the “Paris Commune” and the “October Revolution.” They suggested it be called the “January Revolution,” and that their citywide political regime be called the “New Shanghai Commune,” with its founding declaration being: “Long Live the Victorious January Revolution.” On February 1, the slogan “Long Live the January Revolution” was posted all over the city. On February 5, the “Shanghai People’s Commune” opened shop. This name was concocted by Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, Wang Li, and others. Zhang Chunqiao said that the establishment of the Shanghai People’s Commune “marks the collapse of the bourgeois dictatorship of the old municipal [party] committee and the old people’s committee. It also marks the broad [ranks of the] revolutionary people of the Shanghai proletariat seizing power, assuming rule.” He further said: “Continuing to seize political power and consolidating political power, this is the center of the struggle, the focus of the struggle, and the key to success or failure.” Later, because they faced criticism from Chairman Mao, they had no choice but to change the name to “Revolutionary Committee.” Yet although the name changed, the substance did not change in the slightest.

In this conspiracy, Lin Biao and the “Gang of Four” deceived their superiors and bullied their subordinates, deploying a two-faced counterrevolutionary technique. They, on the one hand, misappropriated the name of mass organization and mass movement in order to deceive Party Center and Chairman Mao; on the other hand, they abused the authority invested in Chairman Mao in order to coerce the masses. For example, it is clear that they themselves set the slogan of the January 6 assembly to “Bring Down Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu.” However, in the briefing to the Center on [January] 5 they said: “Tomorrow the rebels will convene a meeting to criticize the municipal committee. The slogan has been upgraded and changed to ‘Bring Down Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu.’” As another example, after the “Anting Incident” engineered by Wang Hongwen and others, Chen Boda sent a telegram and also requested Zhang Chunqiao to urgently come in person, repeatedly asking the East China Bureau and the Shanghai Municipal Committee to “stand their ground,” [that they] must resolutely not recognize the “Workers’ General Headquarters” as a legal revolutionary organization, [and] must not acknowledge that blocking the railway tracks constituted revolutionary action. However, in the blink of an eye, Zhang Chunqiao signed off acknowledging all of this, and in complete reversal asked the East China Bureau and the municipal committee to conduct a self-examination. At the time, Comrades Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu asked Chen Boda and Zhang Chunqiao to account for why they signed the agreement behind the back of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, reneging on their words. However, after the event, [Chen Pixian and Cao Diqiu] were counterattacked and forcefully accused of the non-existent crime of “bombarding the proletarian headquarters.” All of this and more amply revealed their [Zhang Chunqiao and Chen Boda] counterrevolutionary double-dealing nature.

## (2)

The above facts fully demonstrate that the so-called “January Revolution” was a major conspiracy meticulously planned by Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the “Gang of Four.” It was a counterrevolutionary storm, a counterrevolutionary countercurrent; it was a serious move by them throwing the whole country into a state of confusion and conducting a comprehensive party-usurping power seizure. Their attack was aimed at leading cadres at all levels who were upholding Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line; it was a power seizure directed at the proletariat, a power seizure directed at the Party Center and Chairman Mao.

In Shanghai in the 17 years before the “Great Cultural Revolution,” Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line always constituted the dominant position. The work of the Shanghai Municipal Committee achieved great results, and the vast majority of party members and cadres were good and relatively good; the broad working class made an outstanding contribution. During these 17 years, the Shanghai Municipal Committee, under the direct leadership and loving care of the Party Center, Chairman Mao, and Premier Zhou, led the vast number of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres in the whole city, victoriously carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, transforming the semi-colonial old Shanghai into a new socialist city, building an important industrial and technological base in our country from a “adventurist’s paradise.” Lin Biao, Chen Boda and the “Gang of Four” falsely denounced the Shanghai Municipal Committee as “revisionist,” “counterrevolutionary,” and the “old regime”; they labeled Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu and a lot of leading cadres who upheld Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line as “traitors,” “spies,” and “capitalist roaders,” imposing all kinds of unwarranted charges, conducting brutal struggles and ruthless attacks, completely reversing black and white and confusing right and wrong.

The ringleaders and core members plotting this party-usurping, counterrevolutionary power seizure conspiracy were Lin Biao, Chen Boda, the “Gang of Four,” and their remaining followers such as Ma Tianshui, Xu Jingxian, Wang Xiuzhen, Zhu Yongjia, Chen Ada, Pan Guoping, Huang Jinhai, Dai Liqing, Ma Zhenlong, Ye Changming, and others. They are indeed a company of counterrevolutionary careerists, conspirators, double-dealers, traitors, spies, alien class elements and new bourgeois elements, local hooligans, beaters-smashers-and-looters, and reactionary lettered crooks. Through this great conspiracy to usurp the party and seize power, they formed a counterrevolutionary bourgeois gang structure.

After they seized power, they frantically implemented their revisionist counterrevolutionary line and reactionary political program, creating large numbers of false cases, mistaken cases, and unjust cases, implementing a fascist dictatorship against the broad ranks of cadres and the masses, frenziedly carrying out persecutions, and progressively turning Shanghai into the counterrevolutionary base of putting the country into a state of confusion, as well as usurping the party and the nation’s highest powers. From the start, the broad ranks of cadres and masses in Shanghai detested their attempt to turn back the wheel of history. They adopted all kinds of methods to resist and struggle until the “Gang of Four’s” complete collapse. After the smashing of the “Gang of Four,” under the leadership of the Party Center headed by Chairman Hua Shanghai’s party and state leadership was swiftly regained, which [the Gang] had usurped.

## (3)

In order to fully muster the enthusiasm of the broad ranks of cadres and masses, and further consolidate and develop an excellent, stable, and united situation, after approval from the Party Center, the municipal committee plans to clearly announce that the so-called “January Revolution” was a counterrevolutionary conspiracy orchestrated by Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the “Gang of Four” to usurp the party and seize power. We will take the history they inverted and restore it anew. We will also announce that Chen Pixian, Cao Diqiu, Wei Wenbo, Yang Xiguang and other comrades who were publicly criticized in the so-called “January Revolution,” all those persecuted Scarlet Guards and other mass organizations, and cadres, the masses, as well as each and every false case, mistaken case, and unjust case, be given thorough reversal, all reputations be restored, and all concocted cases and defamatory remarks be entirely repudiated. And we will also announce that those who participated in planning the so-called “January Revolution,” especially the most important key members who continued to conduct party-usurping power-seizing conspiratorial activities, be arrested and handled according to law in order to appease popular indignation. At the same time, we shall make it clear to cadres and the masses that it was only Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the “Gang of Four” and a small group of co-conspirators that planned this counterrevolutionary conspiracy; the mass organizations and the people at that time were hoodwinked and not responsible. We should unite as one and collectively expose and criticize the serious crime of the so-called “January Revolution” planned by Lin Biao, Chen Boda, and the “Gang of Four,” and expose and criticize their counterrevolutionary revisionist line and reactionary ideological system. According to the policy of “solving problems while stabilizing the situation,” we advise that, in dealing with this problem, work can first be dealt with internally, from top to bottom, from within the party to outside the party, unifying understanding, and appropriately resolving [problems]. Depending on the situation, the results of handling the situation can be publicly reported later.

We believe that thoroughly exposing the truth of the January Counterrevolutionary Storm will definitely be greatly welcomed by the broad ranks of cadres and masses of Shanghai. This is beneficial to further mobilize all kinds of positive factors, and, under the guidance of Party Center with Chairman Hua as leader, wholeheartedly implement the four modernizations.

Please instruct whether the above report is appropriate.

## CCP Shanghai Municipal Committee

## December 4, 1978

Translated by the Maoist Legacy Project team

[1] The so-called “Anting Incident” took place in November 1966. Following the Shanghai Municipal Committee (SMC)’s refusal to recognize the newly-established Shanghai Workers’ Revolutionary Rebels General Headquarters (SWRRGH), a worker “rebel” group under the helm of its leader Wang Hongwen, members of the SWRRGH decided to take a train to Beijing to try to win the Center’s support. However, after “Zhou Enlai ordered the train stopped so that the issue could be solved locally,” the train stopped in Anting and the SWRRGH members sat on the tracks in protest for more than a day disrupting rail traffic, until the Center sent Zhang Chunqiao to step in to resolve the issue. Zhang convinced Wang Hongwen and group members to return to Shanghai, where he then sided with the worker rebels group against the local party leadership and against the wishes of the SMC by signing the rebel group’s list of demands, the so-called “five points,” which included recognizing the group as a revolutionary and legal organization. Roderick MacFarquhar & Michael Scheonhals, Mao’s Last Revolution (Cambridge, Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2008), 141-142; Elizabeth Perry & Li Xun, Proletarian Power: Shanghai in the Cultural Revolution (London: Routledge, 2019), 34-36.

[2] The Scarlet Guards (SGs) referred to a conservative group that emerged following the Anting Incident with membership spanning various occupations and districts (but primarily from factories), siding with the local party leadership against Wang Hongwen and his group. The group only lasted until late 1966 or early 1967, about five to six weeks, when the local party leadership suddenly decided to support Wang’s worker rebel group, prompting the SGs to flip its stance on the party leadership. In attempting to continue its stance against the worker rebels under Wang, the SGs tried to get the approval of local leaders. This backfired following Mayor Cao Diqiu’s signing of, then retraction of, the SGs demands in a public confession - the SGs stormed the party committee’s offices, resulting in the first armed battle of the Cultural Revolution, the so-called “Kanging Road Incident.” Zhang Chunqiao called Wang to gather his group and surround the SGs, where combat between the two groups resulted in numerous injuries. Wang’s group also ransacked SG offices around the city and seized its leaders. Perry & Li, Proletarian Power, Chapter 3.

[4] The “evil wind of economism” was a term used to describe leaders that attempted to suppress worker uprisings by appeasing them through economic and material means, such as increasing their wages, or offering better benefits or working conditions.
